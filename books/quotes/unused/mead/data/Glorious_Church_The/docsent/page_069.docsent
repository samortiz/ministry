   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The city has three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are three gates in each direction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gates are usually located in a convenient place to go in and out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the fact that this city has gates on all four sides indicates that it is located in a very central position and that it is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem is the masterpiece in the center of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the gates there are twelve angels to keep the entrance Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly cherubim guarded the way of the tree of life, but now the tree of life in the city is guarded by angels at the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The angels are ministering spirits Heb 1:14 , and the day is coming when angels will be subject to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Revelation 21:15 says, "And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold in the Bible represents all that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The city being measured with gold means that the city can be measured by God's standard and corresponds with God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to seek God's glory, hoping that we will be able to meet God's standard when we are measured in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 16 says, "And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is another place in the Bible where the measurements of length, breadth, and height are equal, that is the Holy of Holies in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof" 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The length, the breadth, and the height are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible, only the Holy of Holies in the temple and the city of the New Jerusalem have equal measurements of length, breadth, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem becomes the Holy of Holies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When David gave Solomon the pattern for the temple, he said, "All this...the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern" 1 Chron 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything in the temple was built according to divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem is the very temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything that constitutes the city is something in God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is nothing that is outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 21:17 says, "And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today can we say that the measure of a man is that of an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, never.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At what time will the measure of a man be equal to that of an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus said that in the resurrection man will be equal to the angels Luke 20:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one hundred and forty-four cubits will be revealed when man's measure is equal to an angel's measure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, everything within this city is in the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank God, of all the things included in this city, there is nothing which is not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything that is dead and everything that is of man is outside the city, but inside everything is resurrected and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Resurrection means that which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything that is of man, once it dies, can never be raised up, but everything that is of God, though it passes through death, will rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever cannot be bound or held by death is called resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When that which originates from us passes through the cross, it is brought to an end, but nothing of God can be touched by death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When John recorded the description of the city, all the numbers he used were twelve or products of twelve twelve gates, twelve foundations, twelve apostles, twelve tribes, etc. The measurement of the city wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, the product of twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Twelve is the number used in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the most precious number in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the first part of Revelation, there are many sevens seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven angels, etc. But in the latter part, there are many twelves, such as those already mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Seven means perfection, and twelve also means perfection, but they are not altogether the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Seven is composed of three plus four, while twelve is composed of three multiplied by four.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God is the Triune God, the number three represents God, while four is the number which represents creation, such as the four winds, the four seasons, and the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When three is added to four, it means that God is added to man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How complete and perfect it is to have the Creator plus the creature!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But anything which is added can also be subtracted and thereby lost again; so this completion is not a lasting one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in the New Jerusalem, the union of God and man is no longer seven, but twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is no longer three plus four, but three multiplied by four.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Multiplication is a perfect union, something which can never be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Creator mingles with the creature it is twelve, and twelve is the number of perfect union.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the new heaven and new earth, God and man will become one, and God and man can no longer be separated.</S>
