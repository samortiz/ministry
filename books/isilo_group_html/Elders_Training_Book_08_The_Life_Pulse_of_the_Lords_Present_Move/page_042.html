<p>I received a long letter of twenty-seven pages on the morning of our final day of fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training. The first page is the contents of the letter and all the rest of the twenty-six pages are signatures. All of the signatures are designated from the different churches. After reading the contents, I am so grateful to the four hundred and nineteen brothers who signed it. The contents of this letter follow along with my letter of response to the brothers who signed it.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
