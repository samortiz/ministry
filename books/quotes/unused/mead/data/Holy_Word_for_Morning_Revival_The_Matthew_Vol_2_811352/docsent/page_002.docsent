   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9 For I also am a man under 1 authority, having soldiers under me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>10 Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 1 The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the examples in the Scriptures, leprosy results from rebellion and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God's deputy authority Num 12:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Naaman's leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience 2 Kings 5:1, 9-14 .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingly Savior came to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy that they might become His kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 1 According to the law, a leper was to be isolated from the people because of his uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one was allowed to touch him Lev 13:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the new King, as a man and as the kingly Savior, touched this leper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What mercy and sympathy!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By His one touch, his leprosy was immediately cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What wonderful cleansing!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>9 1 The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, he believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was stronger faith, and it was marveled at by the Savior v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 8:1-17 three miracles the cleansing of the leper, the healing of the paralyzed Gentile servant, and the healing of Peter's mother-in-law and the healing of many are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine, that is, they have a dispensational significance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The diseases healed in the cases recorded in Matthew 8 are significant, for every disease signifies a specific spiritual sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leper here represents the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Jews have become rebellious against God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, the heavenly King came not to judge them, but to heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He came as a Physician to heal the sick 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Jewish leper was healed by the King's direct touch.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the centurion's servant was healed by the King's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Gentile centurion believed in this word, and his servant was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jews are always saved through the King's direct touch, but we Gentiles are saved through believing the enlivening, regenerating word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the centurion's servant represents all the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord did not commend the faith of the leper, because faith was not the outstanding characteristic there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The significant thing was the King's touch.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But with the healing of the centurion's servant, faith is very outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the Lord praised the centurion's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consequently, the servant was healed.</S>
