   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT THE MAN-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONSTITUTING HIS QUALIFICATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BASIC FACTOR FOR HIS DYNAMIC SALVATION 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:31; Matt 5:20; Phil 3:9</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen in the two foregoing messages that the Man-Savior s incarnation was for the fulfilling of God s purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall go on to consider the Man-Savior s highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This morality constitutes the Man-Savior s qualification and the basic factor for His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Man-Savior s morality qualifies Him to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, His morality is the basic factor for His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These matters are very difficult to explain, and we look to the Lord for help through His unveiling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCEIVED OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WITH THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FOR THE CONTENT AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Man-Savior was conceived of the divine essence, which actually is God Himself with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, the divine essence is God with all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Bible, what God is is revealed mainly in four aspects: love, light, righteousness, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is love 1 John 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Love is God s intrinsic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is also light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Light is God s shining, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Love refers to what God is intrinsically within Himself, and light refers to God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Holiness refers to God s nature and righteousness to God s way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the full revelation of the Scriptures, God is love and light, and He is also holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the divine attributes, and the Man-Savior was conceived of God with these attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine attributes are for the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Man-Savior was conceived of God with the divine attributes for the content and reality of His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In understanding this, it is helpful to use the illustration of a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a glove is not filled with a hand, the glove will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The hand is both the content and reality of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only when the hand is put into the glove does the glove have content and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the hand in the glove that causes it to have content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, when the hand moves, the glove also moves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The glove is designed to fit the hand, but it does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the hand that causes the glove to move.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the hand moves, the hand within the glove will be expressed through the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say that we are a glove designed to contain God as our content and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ was conceived of God with His attributes to be the content and reality of the glove of His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To Fill the Empty Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the One who was conceived of the divine essence with the divine attributes to be the content and reality of His human virtues, Christ fills the empty human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Human love, for example, is a shell that should contain the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without containing the divine love, human love is merely an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Man-Savior was conceived of God with the divine attributes in order to fill His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With Him the human virtues are not empty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, with us the human virtues are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reason the human virtues are not empty with Jesus Christ, the Man-Savior, is that His human virtues are filled with the divine attributes.</S>
