   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Result a. The Greater Curse</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result of man's second fall, God pronounced a greater curse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength" 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These words were a warning to Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God seemed to be saying, "Since you have done such evil things, the ground will be under a greater curse than it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was cursed because of the fall of your parents and so it brought forth thorns and thistles 3:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now, because of your further fall, the ground will receive a further curse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will be cursed to the extent that regardless how much you labor upon it, it will not yield to you its strength."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Vagabondism</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, God told Cain that "a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth" 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is a vagabond?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A vagabond, or a wanderer, is a person who has no goal, no home, no satisfaction, and no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A vagabond has no dwelling place and no comfort; he continually wanders on the earth, floating from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God told Cain that he would become such a vagabond.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This sentence, however, was a merciful sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If, at any time, Cain would have repented and sought God's forgiveness, the Lord would have been happy to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose Cain had said, "Lord, I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I didn't take the way that You showed to my parents, the way that my parents told me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I repent and take that way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Cain had prayed in this way, God surely would have forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But listen to Cain's response to God's merciful sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that everyone that findeth me shall slay me" 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is not the slightest hint of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cain was only bargaining with God, saying that he would be driven out from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What does it mean to be driven out from the face of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult for any reader of the Bible to understand this word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What do you think it means?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apparently, Cain was not driven out from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could he be away from the face of the earth and continue to live?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remember that this word was not spoken by God, for He had only said that Cain would be a fugitive and a vagabond, not that he would be driven away from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, Cain understood God's words in this way, realizing that he was about to be driven out from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I shall answer this question later on in the message.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Cain did not repent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He argued in a fearful way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was not afraid of God, but of being killed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why did he have this fear?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because he had killed his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A number of times Brother Watchman Nee said to me, "If someone thinks that you might steal from him, that person must be a robber.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only a robber is afraid that others will steal from him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you never steal from others, you will not think that others would steal from you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you know nothing about robbery, you will never entertain the thought that someone might rob you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if you rob others, you will be aware of the danger of being robbed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Cain was afraid of being murdered because he had murdered his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, he did not repent, but argued with God, saying, "It shall come to pass, that everyone that findeth me shall slay me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Cain knew that he had no safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, God was kind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is always kind according to what we are able to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him" 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We see that God put a mark upon Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not ask me what this mark was, for I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I only know that God marked Cain as a safeguard to him.</S>
