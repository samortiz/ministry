   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Forty-six THE SAVIOR PREPARED BY GOD Scripture: Isa 53 God prepared a Savior for man Man did not seek God s salvation; it was God who came to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God wanted to save man, He had to prepare a Savior for him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason God had to prepare a Savior for man is that God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His love caused Him to come to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His righteousness required that He prepare a Savior for him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The person of the Savior The Savior is the arm of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The arm refers to power and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the arm of the Lord is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The power of God is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God, when manifesting Himself to be our saving power, is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Savior is God revealed to be our saving power; yet He came as a poor man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore Isaiah 53:2 says, He grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This refers to the fact that the Lord was brought up in a poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Almighty God, but He became a poor man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because He was poor and like a root out of dry ground, He had no form nor comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no beauty that we should desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter 52 of this book tells us that His appearance was so marred, more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today all the so-called pictures of Jesus are unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They all portray Him as One who is so desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Jesus of that time had no beauty that men should desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Savior s sufferings He was a man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should quote all the verses in Isaiah 53.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A very special term is used in Isaiah 53:3, a man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His whole life, from the manger to the cross, was full of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was born in sorrow and suffered continually until He was finally laid to rest in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to speak of His sufferings from the manger to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hymn #628 can be used as a reference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sufferings during His lifetime came from three directions: from man, from God, and from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What came from man was the suffering of persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What came from Satan was the suffering of attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What came from God was the suffering of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Savior s bearing of sins The righteousness of God requires that God judge man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God put all the sins of mankind upon the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Quote verse 6: The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because God laid all the iniquities of mankind on the Savior, the judgments of God toward men were also inflicted upon the Savior s body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because God judged this Savior who bore our sins, He was bruised.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the evidence of bearing sin: He was numbered with the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that God looked at Him at that time as He would look at a sinner, because He was bearing our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Savior s accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Savior has fully accomplished His saving work and has become a perfect Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Savior has borne our sins to satisfy the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the situation at the time of His burial was different from the situation at the time of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While He was dying, He was numbered with the transgressors; but when He was buried, He was put into a rich man s tomb, because he had satisfied the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This resurrection is what is spoken of in Isaiah 53:10, He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He has resurrected from the dead, He can be the Savior in resurrection, and He can accomplish that which is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore it is also said in verse 11, He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In His resurrection He has gained, together with God, all the people which should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 12 says, Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Great is God; the Strong is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He resurrected from the dead and enjoys the result of salvation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This result is to recapture people from the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because of His resurrection and ascension, He causes so many people to obtain His salvation, and to be justified because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How to accept the Savior The way to accept is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the very beginning of this chapter it says, Who hath believed our message?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To believe is to receive with your heart and your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not only acknowledge Him as your Savior, but also open your heart to receive Him as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to Romans 10:13, the believers must call, and calling includes the confessing of sins: Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
