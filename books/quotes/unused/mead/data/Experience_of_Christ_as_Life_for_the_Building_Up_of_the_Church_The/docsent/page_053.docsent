   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Exo 30:23-33; 2 Cor 1:21-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to have more fellowship concerning how we can grow so that the church might be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way is by the anointing of the compound Spirit, typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BEING SANCTIFIED BY THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that all the parts of the tabernacle with all its contents were not holy until they were anointed Exo 30:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The anointing was the factor that made the entire tabernacle holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This anointing sanctified the whole dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word sanctify means to join something with God, to make something have the divine essence and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be sanctified is not to be sinlessly perfect, nor is it to be merely separated and changed in our position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Strictly speaking, to be sanctified means to be joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, if we are joined to God, we are separated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this attachment to God is not only a change in position but also a change in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By being sanctified our whole being is mingled with the divine, holy essence and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 1:4 speaks of "the Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wuest's translation uses "divine essence" instead of "the Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, holiness is the divine essence of God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be sanctified is to be joined, to be attached, to the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be sanctified is to be made one with God and to make God one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sanctification is carried out by the anointing Spirit, who anoints us with the divine essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen from Exodus 30 that the compound ointment typifies the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit today is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the previous chapter, we saw all the ingredients of the compound ointment, which typify the ingredients of today's compound Spirit, who is anointing us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The humanity and divinity of Christ, His death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power have been compounded into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ability to bear responsibility and the building element are also elements of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the elements of Christ's person and work have been put into this one Spirit, the compound Spirit.</S>
