   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING MATURE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Colossians 1:28 and 29 Paul, speaking of Christ, says, Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man mature in Christ; whereunto I also labor, struggling according to his operation, which operates in me in power Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Paul s desire was to present every man mature in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word mature is related to in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a man is mature in Christ, he is qualified to be presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we be mature?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We mature by growing, and we grow by having more life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 10:10 Jesus said, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have life is to be regenerated, and to have life abundantly is to grow into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once again, we come to the crucial point of Christ s having to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If He were not the Spirit of life, how could He be our life and life supply?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not fighting for doctrine; we are fighting for Christ s reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reality, the reality of Christ s being in us, has been overlooked and neglected for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is one of the main items of the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE NEED OF FIGHTING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 29 Paul says that he labors, struggling according to his operation, which operates in me in power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was laboring, struggling, fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we simply preach the gospel for the sake of winning souls, there will be no need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people think that I am stupid for offending people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in the eyes of the Lord I am wise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I did not offend anyone, then I would be the most stupid one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to minister Christ for the completion of the word of God, there is the need of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Satan is so subtle, we cannot avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan uses many things to preoccupy people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even religion is an instrument used by Satan to occupy man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we must fight against the traditional concepts of today s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must tell people that Christ is not only objective, but that our Christ is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He who is joined to Him is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only is He the life-giving Spirit, but we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How subjective this is!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the crucial point that we are fighting for.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CRUCIAL POINT THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the past fourteen years, in this country, I have not charged the sisters to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not pass on such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Years ago, I did this, but it was unsuccessful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Always the sisters would say, Brother Lee, what you told me to practice was only good for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What shall I do now?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I gave them a further teaching on the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That teaching was like an injection of a drug that only lasted a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a few days, the sisters would return for another injection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, I quit doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I said to the Lord, Doesn t Your word say that wives should submit to their husbands?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I read Ephesians 5 to the Lord, saying, Lord, I didn t preach the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I taught Your holy word in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is this not Your word?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been preaching this for years without any success.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord said to me, Stupid child, didn t you see that Ephesians 5:18 says to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After that it says that wives should submit and that husbands should love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you have no gasoline in your car, then you may have to push it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if the gas tank is filled with gasoline, then you can drive without any effort.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Never again will I be one who pushes; I am an enjoyer, enjoying the unlimited divine gasoline.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are filled in our spirit with Christ, then we have something with which to submit and to love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial point in this portion of Colossians is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul was made a minister according to the economy of God to complete the word of God to make the crucial matter of Christ s being in us clear to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is to complete the word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As you meet Christians today, you will discover the need for such a completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christians know that God created the heavens and the earth, that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary, that He was crucified for their redemption, and that after three days He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We also believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They also know that the blood of Jesus washes their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We know this and believe it at least as much as they do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, among most Christians one thing is missing: the fact that Christ is in us this very moment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This Christ is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to complete the word of God we must emphasize the crucial matter that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
