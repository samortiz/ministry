<h2 class="head1">THE ARK OF ACACIA WOOD</h2>
<p>From the types in the Scriptures we can see the need of a proper humanity for the church life. We have seen in the past what the Ark and the tabernacle signify: the Ark is Christ, and the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark. So the tabernacle signifies the enlargement of Christ. This enlargement of Christ is His Body, the church, which is His fullness. When Christ as the Ark is increased and enlarged, there is the tabernacle. Then we have the church. Just as the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark, so the church is the increase and enlargement of Christ.</p>
<p>This can be proved since the Ark was made of acacia wood overlaid within and without with gold. &ldquo;And they shall make an ark of acacia wood...And you shall overlay it with pure gold; inside and outside you shall overlay it; and you shall make a rim of gold upon it&rdquo; (Exo. 25:10a, 11). The gold was made into a type of crown all around the four sides of the top of the Ark. By the word <em>rim,</em> or <em>crown,</em> we realize that the gold was mainly for decoration. It is not called the Ark of gold, but the Ark of acacia wood. So the main and basic structure of the Ark is wood. Wood in typology always signifies humanity, and acacia wood typifies the humanity of Jesus. Gold, which in typology signifies the divine nature, overlays the wood, which is the human nature. So Christ as the Ark is the human nature overlaid with the divine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BOARDS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>We must also consider the tabernacle. The tabernacle is mainly composed of forty-eight boards. These boards are made of the same material and in the same way as the Ark. &ldquo;And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up...And you shall overlay the boards with gold&rdquo; (26:15, 29a). The Ark was made with acacia wood overlaid with gold, and the boards of the tabernacle were also made with the same material and in the same way&mdash;acacia wood overlaid with gold.</p>
<p>However, we must note what Exodus 26:15 says concerning the boards of the tabernacle. In this verse God says that the boards are to be standing up. We all know that gold is valuable, weighty, and shining, but in a sense gold is not capable of standing by itself. In order for the boards of the tabernacle to stand up, there is the need of the acacia wood. Acacia wood is quite adequate for standing up.</p>
<p>So in the tabernacle, again the acacia wood is the main structure. This means that the enlargement of Christ, the church, is composed mainly of the humanity of Jesus overlaid with divinity. We need humanity, and we also need divinity, but it is the humanity in the church that causes the church to stand up. As we look at today&rsquo;s situation, we see that in so many places the so-called Christian churches are not standing up but rather falling down. Some have even fallen already. They may say they are spiritual, but they are spiritual lying down, not standing up. They are short of the acacia wood, the proper humanity of the man Jesus. Both the Ark and the tabernacle had the acacia wood as their main substance. Just as Christ stood by the proper humanity, so His humanity alone can cause the church to stand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Now we need to read 1 Timothy 3:15-16. These two verses in the Scriptures are wonderful and far beyond our understanding. &ldquo;But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; The church is the church of the living God. The church is not just the church of God in heaven or the church in doctrine. It is the church of the living God. The church must have God living in it, and this church of the living God is the pillar and base of the reality.</p>
<p>The architecture used during the time 1 Timothy was written was mainly that of Greece. Greek architecture utilized columns or pillars, which supported the entire building. The church of the living God is just like such pillars with a base to hold Christ as the reality. The word <em>truth</em> in verse 15 can also be translated as &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; For the church to be such a pillar to hold Christ as the reality, the proper humanity of Jesus is required. This is shown in the following verse, where we are told that God was manifested in the flesh. As we have seen, the flesh is simply humanity. This proves that for the church to be the proper pillar to support Christ as the reality, the humanity of Jesus is required. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> pp. 85-86, 86-87, 88)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>God has drawn a boundary line to keep the human spirit for His purpose, but Satan has done and still is doing many things to damage both the soul and the body of man. All he can do to our spirit is to deaden it by means of the conscience. Praise the Lord that he can only do that much! However, according to the revelation of the Bible, Satan has liberty to do whatever he can to damage our mentality (the main part of the soul is the mind) and our body. This is the subtlety of the enemy.</p>
<p>We cannot tell how many mental cases there are in today&rsquo;s society; they are innumerable. This condition is not only a kind of mental illness, but it is also the subtle work of Satan. Experts will tell you that in the history of humanity, there have never been as many mental cases as today. According to our experience, it is easy to deal with demon possession, but it is really difficult for any Christian to deal with a mental case. Satan is so subtle today. He is doing whatever he can to damage the mentality of man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 84</div><br></body></html>
