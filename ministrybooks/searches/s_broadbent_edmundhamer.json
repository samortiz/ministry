In The Pilgrim Church E. H. Broadbent, a Brethren writer, traces an unbroken line of this battle through every century. Although the battle for the truth was apparently stopped by the Roman Catholic Church from the sixth century until the fifteenth century, the battle went on secretly. Because the Bible was locked away and the truth was hidden, those ten centuries were in darkness. Hence, those were the Dark Ages. Rarely did anyone stand up to speak for the truth. The Roman Catholic Church had the final say in matters of the truth, but many of its teachings were superstitious, heretical, or a mixture. In Matthew 13:33 the Lord prophetically illustrated this impure mixture when He spoke of the woman who hid leaven in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. All of so-called Christendom became leavened, and the truth was concealed until the Reformation began.

However, I doubt that most who make this accusation truly understand what modalism is or where it came from. In order to equip the saints to fight the battle for the truth, we need to help them to know something about modalism. We should study the history of the church and the creeds. The best exposition of church history is an eight-volume work written by Philip Schaff. A shorter, more spiritual book on church history was written by E. H. Broadbent, who met with the Brethren. Another Brethren writer, Andrew Miller, wrote a lengthy church history, which is good but incomplete and lacking in detail. Schaff\u2019s is a complete and detailed church history. Schaff also wrote Creeds of Christendom, in which he compiles the creeds and gives a detailed history of each one. We can learn about modalism by reading Schaff\u2019s Creeds of Christendom.

Eventually E. H. Broadbent, a historian among the Brethren, discovered them and researched their hidden history, finding that there were hidden overcomers throughout these ten centuries. He said that there are two lines in church history: an outward history and a hidden history. The hidden Christians, however, are small in number. Even if we try to more fully investigate their history, we will not be able to find out much; however, we can see that the flow of the Holy Spirit was with a small number of hidden overcomers. They were not visible on the surface of history. Only the activities of the Catholic Church are visible. After the Reformation many groups were raised up. They were released from the Catholic Church and were no longer restricted, bound, or controlled by her. As a result, they began to develop on their own.

E. H. Broadbent, a prominent church historian among the brothers who were raised up in England, wrote a book entitled The Pilgrim Church. In that book he points out that the line of the Lord\u2019s recovery began from the second century and has never ceased throughout the centuries. After many years of degradation the Lord used Martin Luther to recover the basic truth of justification by faith. Then, during the seventeenth century the mystics, a group of believers that pursued the inner life, were raised up in the Catholic Church. That group, led by Madame Guyon, was used by the Lord to recover the experiences of the inner life. In the eighteenth century the Lord continued His recovery and used Count Zinzendorf to recover the church life in the oneness of [183] the Holy Spirit in an initial way. Then, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England to recover the church life more completely under the leadership of J. N. Darby. That recovered church life among the brothers can be regarded as the fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia recorded in Revelation 3. However, within about a hundred years after the Brethren were raised up, they became divided again and again because of their different doctrinal views; hence, the Lord was forced to turn to China to continue His recovery.

We had become dormant. By the Lord\u2019s mercy He caused us to realize that we needed to get into His recovery in an ultimate way. Many scriptural truths and practices have been recovered by the Lord throughout the history of the church. Brother E. H. Broadbent in his book The Pilgrim Church traced the line of the Lord\u2019s recovery since the second century. The Lord has recovered so much, but there is at least one thing that He has not recovered. He has not yet recovered the way to meet. The traditional way of meeting in Christianity is according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8, NASB). Brother Nee saw this fifty years ago. This matter of the scriptural way to meet has been printed in his books The Normal Christian Church Life and Church Affairs. He said that the church has to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. This is a big item in the New Testament that needs to be recovered. Where can we see a meeting in which the Christians come together, and each one has something? In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul uses the word has five times\u2014each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality. This is different from the customs of the nations. Whenever the nations have a gathering, only one person speaks, and the rest listen. This practice is worldly and natural.

H. Broadbent pointed out that the line of the Lord\u2019s recovery started in the second century and has continued throughout the centuries. Eventually, at the time [522] of the Reformation with Martin Luther, the recovery of the Lord came into a definite form. The Lord used Martin Luther to recover the basic truth of justification by faith. In the seventeenth century some within the Catholic Church reacted to the deadness of the reformed churches. These were the mystics, whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life. The Lord went on in the eighteenth century with Zinzendorf to recover the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit. In the early part of the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England under the leadership of John Nelson Darby to recover the church life in a fuller way. This recovered church life might be considered as the fulfillment of the epistle to Philadelphia in Revelation 3. The Brethren began in 1828, but within ninety years they were divided into about one hundred divisions.

Even the sisters can indirectly be used by the Lord to establish a church. For instance, a sister may gain some of her relatives, and some of these may become useful brothers whom the Lord may eventually use to establish churches. I believe that what the Lord has shown us in the last four years concerning the way to meet and to serve is the biblical way. If we practice the church life according to this New Testament way, the church life and the spread of the church will be easy. This way to meet and to serve God has been gradually seen through the centuries. In The Pilgrim Church, a church history written by E. H. Broadbent, he presents a line of seeking ones in every century, up to the Brethren in the last century, through whom the Lord gradually carried out a work of recovery. Regrettably, after each stage in the Lord\u2019s work of recovery, some became content and stopped; they did not continue with the Lord in His recovery.

From approximately the sixth century until the sixteenth century, for a period of ten centuries, the history of the West is known as the Dark Ages.

Therefore, in every century the Lord raised up some men for the move of His recovery work. A brother by the name of E. H. Broadbent has written a book called The Pilgrim Church.

Included in this record is Martin Luther, who is well-known and was an overcomer of the sixteenth century. He recovered the truth concerning justification by faith. By the seventeenth century, among the Catholics, the mystics who sought after the inner life were raised up. They were opposed to the deadness and coldness of the situation of the time. The leading figure in this group was Madame Guyon. These people were very good in the experience in life. But they were not clear concerning the church.
