   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEEKING HELP FROM OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REDUCE OUR SUFFERING BEING A SHAME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way of consecration is a way of suffering, a way of sacrifice, in which everything that pertains to us is wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people consecrate themselves in order to gain sympathy from others and reduce their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These believers have lost their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is shameful to seek help from others in order to reduce our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are consecrated should learn not to seek help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would prefer to suffer before the Lord than to seek help from others, and we would prefer to starve for three days than to let others know our need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this is not our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some who suffer just a little desire to be noticed by others and to receive help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that their consecration is not as strong as it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first group of serving ones among us did not seek help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They even told people that they would not take the way of receiving help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They had the ability to make money in the world, but for the Lord s sake they did not go to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the situation and character of the serving ones in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sadly, some of us are now afraid that we will not receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems as if it is a shame for us not to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it is glorious for others not to take care of us, because we serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not glorious to seek the help and sympathy of others; rather, it is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will become pitiful parasites if we always expect others to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of this, some are able to rebuke us, saying that we are the parasites of society since we depend on others for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that our consecration is not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this does not mean that the saints should not love or care for the Lord s serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For many years the senior co-workers have held the principle that we do not appreciate or feel grateful for the care we directly receive from others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not want to receive any help directly from man s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those with a burden to care for us should give through the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We want to receive our supply directly from God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Someone once asked a full-time serving brother how much support he received that week.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such questions are an insult to those who serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such people should be looked in the eye and told that it does not concern them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their questions do not reflect a love for those who serve the Lord; rather, they are an insult.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person who is truly concerned should put something in the offering box without asking how much a serving one receives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such questions are improper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The wife of a serving brother once said that her husband received only a few dollars a week.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This caused others to feel that we should help this brother find a job.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since this couple was willing to take this way, they should not complain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One who serves the Lord should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who take this way should be clear that this is a way of suffering and poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should not expect to have a prosperous life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord never said that those who take this way will have food to eat and a good living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He said that we should forsake our all to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should even lose our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is glorious if we can live by faith for an entire year without anyone showing concern for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, there are situations in which serving ones ask others for help.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are in this condition, we can do the work of Christianity, but we cannot do the work of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we build up the church, our fame, reputation, being, and family will be wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our reputation, what we are, and what we have must be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostle Paul was wrecked by the Lord; the Lord gained his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus can wreck people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many lives have been wrecked by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a matter of consecration, of paying the price; this is to fill up...that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ...for His Body Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE WAY OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BEING CONSIDERED AS ABNORMAL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must consider this matter of consecration and consider the price that we must pay.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those in Christianity do not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be prepared to be wrecked by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not measure things according to natural thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not consider our profession, marriage, family, or studies according to natural thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The situation of the early apostles, the Christians in the early church life, and those who have followed the Lord throughout the ages surely cannot be considered as normal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can be considered as normal only if we are not consecrated and not taking the way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of the ways of consecration surely are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, the parents of Sister Dora Yu sent her to England to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, when the ship she was on arrived at the port of Marseilles, France, she told the captain that she had to go back to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot take a normal path in our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we take a normal path, we cannot take the way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we all see that the way of serving the Lord is a way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing is normal in this way; instead, everything is abnormal.</S>
