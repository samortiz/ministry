   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FACTS, NOT PARABLES OR METAPHORS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was young, I was told that those portions of the Word which speak of eating and drinking the Lord are merely parables or metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was taught that we could not actually eat Jesus, that this is simply a figure of speech, a metaphor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But recently as I have been considering the eating and drinking of the Lord Jesus, I have been impressed by Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 10:4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Paul does not say that the rock was a type of Christ or a symbol of Christ; he says clearly that the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4 Paul speaks of the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lacking Paul s boldness, we may weaken the force of his declaration by saying that the rock typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly I did not have the boldness to say that the water flowing out of the rock was spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To my understanding, that water was physical, not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, I did not dare to say that the rock from which the water flowed was a spiritual rock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But Paul says boldly and plainly that it was a spiritual rock which followed the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then he goes on to say, not that the rock was a type of Christ, but that the rock was Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to say this without Paul s word as a basis, we would surely be condemned as heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not regard the eating and drinking of Jesus as parables or metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I wish to declare strongly that these are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daily, even hourly, I eat and drink the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 6 the Lord says that He came from heaven to be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not a parable or a metaphoric utterance; it is a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is our food and our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 7:37-38 he goes on to say that whoever thirsts may come to Him and drink and that out of his inner being will flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a heavenly fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily living, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, it is by our eating and drinking Him that God works Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By eating and drinking we take the Lord into us, and He becomes one with us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we eat and drink certain elements, those elements are taken into us and become one with us in substance and in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, how can the meat and vegetables on the dining table become one with us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only way is by our eating them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we eat and drink, our food becomes one with us organically and, when it has been digested and assimilated, it actually becomes part of our being, our very fiber and tissue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Realizing this will help us to see the importance of eating and drinking in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eating and drinking the Lord are of tremendous significance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, how we need to eat Him and drink Him!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE IMPORTANCE OF DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the biblical record, drinking is more important than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 22:17 does not say that whoever is hungry may come and eat; it says that whoever is thirsty may come and drink the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that in the divine concept drinking is more crucial than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 2 the tree of life is mentioned first, then the river.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But at the end of the Bible, in Revelation 22, the water of life is mentioned first, then the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life grows in the water of life, a fact that clearly indicates that it is the living water which conveys the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This implies that eating is included in drinking and that drinking is more basic than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is also proved by the fact that in our physical life we can survive longer without eating than without drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the sequence in the Bible, food is presented first and then water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is true both in the book of Genesis and in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exodus 16 speaks of food, the heavenly manna, and then chapter seventeen goes on to speak of the water flowing from the smitten rock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same sequence is found in the opening chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 2:7 says, To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The water of life is not mentioned until Revelation 7:17, where we are told that the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall guide them to springs of waters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the end of Revelation, however, the order is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all know that both in speaking and in writing the final word is decisive and conclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The concluding word of Revelation, even of the whole Bible, puts drinking before eating.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The unveiling of God s basic thought concludes not with eating, but with drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation 22:17 tells us that those who are thirsty may come and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, the Bible is profound; on the other hand, it is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In its practicality the Bible concludes with a call related to drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By this we see the vital importance of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not know how to drink, we cannot be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When some hear such a statement, they may wonder about all the believers who have gone before us, most of whom did not know the way to drink the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, many of them did drink of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In much the same way, people who lived centuries ago did not know about vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This does not mean, however, that they did not take vitamins into them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They took vitamins without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same principle, many of those Christians who have gone before us had many experiences of drinking the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, it is nonetheless a fact that they did not know how to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They enjoyed drinking, but they did not have the science of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this message and in the message which follows, I am burdened not simply with drinking itself, but in particular with the science of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Daily I take vitamins purposely and knowingly, unlike those who take vitamins without having any knowledge of them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Likewise, if we know the science of drinking, we shall be able to drink knowingly and purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We shall have both the knowledge of how to drink as well as the actual drinking of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even the psalmist in the Old Testament had the experience of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Psalm 36:8 says, Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The one river includes many pleasures, many joys.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even before the Lord Jesus came, the Old Testament saints experienced the joy of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But when God came in the flesh, He sent forth the clear call to come to Him and drink John 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Drinking is vital to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>THE COMPLETING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>AND THE MENDING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The New Testament was written by a number of different authors, including Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, James, Jude, and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Colossians 1:25 Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul was commissioned with the ministry of completing the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Without the writings of Paul the divine revelation in the Bible would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If Paul s writings were not included in the Scriptures, the Bible would be like an incomplete sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, the Epistles of Paul are necessary for the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>John s ministry is a ministry of mending.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After the divine revelation had been completed through Paul, there was an amount of breakage.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>John came in to mend what had been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Bible closes with Paul s completing ministry and John s mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As we know, the book of Revelation, written by John, is the last book in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In both the ministry of Paul and the ministry of John, that is, in both the completing ministry and the mending ministry, the matters of eating and drinking are strongly emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul covers both eating and drinking in the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In 1 Corinthians 3:2 Paul says to the believers in Corinth, I gave you milk to drink, not solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This word implies eating.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then in 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul goes on to say that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In 1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4 Paul covers both eating and drinking: And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Paul ministered spiritual food and drink to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His ministry was a ministry of feeding and of supplying water to quench the thirst of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Gospel of John was written at least twenty years after the last of Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Since John s ministry was a mending ministry, his Gospel is a mending Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Problems had been caused by certain ones who called themselves Christians but did not believe in the deity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In his Gospel John mended the damage caused by this lack of faith in Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>His Gospel reveals clearly that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Furthermore, we have pointed out that in the very Gospel which emphasizes the deity of Christ the eating and drinking of the Lord are also emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have also seen that in the book of Revelation we find reference to both eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This indicates definitely that John s ministry, like that of Paul, stresses the importance of eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Without eating and drinking, there is no way for us to be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is of vital importance that we learn how to drink the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There is the need to give our attention to all that the Bible reveals concerning how to drink the Lord.</S>
