   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE SPIRIT S SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first part of 2:7 says, He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But at the end of all seven epistles it is the Spirit speaking to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once again, this proves that the speaking Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever Christ speaks, that is the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can argue with this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who was speaking to the church in Ephesus?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ, the Son of Man holding the messengers in His right hand and walking in the midst of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As verse 7 indicates, the speaker eventually is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proves that Christ is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit; it also emphasizes the vital importance of the Spirit in the darkness of the church s degradation as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same emphasis is also seen in 14:13 and 22:17.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is foolish to say that Christ today is not the speaking Spirit, and it is ridiculous to separate the speaking Spirit from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the speaker were only Christ without being the speaking Spirit, He could never speak some words into our spirit, and His speaking would not be very subjective and touching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But, as our experience testifies, if, as we read these epistles, we are open in our spirit to Him, the Spirit will immediately speak something of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the speaker is not the objective Christ but the subjective Spirit, He speaks not only in the black and white letters of the Bible, but also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we hear His speaking, something indelible is wrought into us, and nothing can take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Christ today is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I rejoice over this fact and I boldly proclaim it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. To the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, each of the seven epistles is the word of the Lord to a particular church; but, on the other hand, it is the word of the Spirit to all of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every church should not only give heed to the epistle written to her particularly, but also to all the epistles written to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This implies that all the churches, as the Lord s testimony in the Spirit, should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we must be in the churches to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How else can we hear what the Spirit is saying?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is speaking to the churches, not to any religion, denomination, or group of seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason that not many Christians can hear the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit does not even speak just to one church, but to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although some supposed churches want to be unique, we should not be a unique or particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are, we shall miss the speaking of the Spirit because the Spirit is speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In none of the seven epistles does the Spirit speak to a particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the churches should be common, not unique.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the past years, I have heard many say that every church must be distinctive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who hold this concept say that every church must have its local uniqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although this thought sounds attractive, actually it is quite repulsive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To make your local church unique is to separate yourself from all the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do this, you are through with the Spirit s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Which is better to be unique or to be common?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although you may say that it is better to be common, the fact is that everyone likes to be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In your heart, you want the church in your locality to be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, in the local churches, do not try to be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must be common because the Spirit speaks to the churches, not to any unique church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are in the church and among the churches, we have the right position and the right angle to hear the Spirit s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. Requiring a Proper Ear to Hear</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In spiritual things, seeing depends upon hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The writer of this book firstly heard the voice 1:10 and then saw the vision 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our ears are heavy and cannot hear, then we cannot see Isa 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Jews would not hear the word of the Lord, so they could not see what the Lord was doing Matt 13:15; Acts 28:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord always wants to open our ears to hear His voice Job 33:14-16; Isa 50:4-5; Exo 21:6 that we may see things according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The heavy ears need to be circumcised Jer 6:10; Acts 7:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sinner s ears need to be cleansed with the redeeming blood and anointed with the Spirit Lev 14:14, 17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To serve the Lord as priests also requires our ears to be cleansed with the redeeming blood Exo 29:20; Lev 8:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this book, as the Spirit is speaking to the churches, we all need an opened, circumcised, cleansed, and anointed ear to hear the Spirit s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although our angle and position may be right, we still may not have the proper ear to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Chapter one emphasizes seeing and chapters two and three emphasize hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to both see and hear.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Among our physical senses, which is more important seeing or hearing?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose you had the choice of losing either your sight or your hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Which would you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may say that seeing is more important than hearing, but hearing is deeper than seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, we must tell the Lord, Lord, I need to both see and hear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Have mercy on me, Lord, and grant me eyes to see and ears to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may have to struggle with the Lord, telling Him that we must be able to both see and hear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hearing is more intimate than seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our closest friends will speak intimately to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you lose your hearing organ, you will be unable to enjoy this intimacy with your loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In chapter one, John saw; in chapters two and three, he heard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to see the church life and we need to hear the intimate contents of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To see the church is one thing, and to hear the intimate contents of the church life is another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although many of us have seen the church, not many have heard the intimate contents of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, we need an ear to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
