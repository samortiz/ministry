   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELIGION BEING SOMETHING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>YET APART FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND WITHOUT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Religion is something for God and for the benefit of people, yet it is apart from Christ and without the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as Christ is not in something, no matter how good it may be, it is only religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if we pray or study the Bible but are not in the spirit and do not have the Spirit of Christ, we are in religion, which does not bring forth the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord s recovery is to bring us back to the proper church life, and Christ as the Spirit is the only element that produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as we do things in the spirit and with the Spirit of Christ, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, whatever we do may be good, may be for God, and may be for people s benefit, but we will simply produce another kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all must pray, Lord, be merciful to me that I would not do anything that produces a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we do must be realized and practiced in our spirit with the Spirit of Christ as the presence and reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need this revelation, and all the veils upon us need to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will see that what matters is not to have certain practices but to have the living Christ revealed in us v. 16 . Mere teaching is not able to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, the more we speak, fellowship, and meet in the way of the church, the more the veils are removed and the more we receive a revelation in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s desire is not a matter of religion but of the living Christ, the life-giving Spirit, dwelling in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On his way to Damascus, Paul received not mere teaching but a revelation from the heavens so that he could see Christ and God s will to have the church, which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time Paul became clear not by man s teaching but by a revelation of Christ from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what we need today, and this is what the Lord is bringing to pass at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that the Lord s recovery is here to produce another religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are practicing even the best things in a religious way, we should give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 15 of chapter 6 says, Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The new creation the new man, the church is produced only by Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we read Galatians again and pray-read the crucial verses in it, we will see that Christ is versus religion, and the church is versus traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, the proper gospel is not out of man but from God, and we receive it not by mere teaching but by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Galatians 1:15-16 Paul tells us that at a certain time it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s will today is to bring us back to Himself as the origin, the beginning, and to bring forth the church life by revealing Christ in us, not as an outward teaching but as an inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HAVING OUR ENTIRE BEING UNVEILED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO SEE CHRIST AND RECEIVE HIM INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s will is simply to reveal His Son, Christ, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to leave behind the religious ways of meeting, praying, and teaching in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should even leave behind our old traditional knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we need is to have our entire being unveiled to see Christ and receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we experience the indwelling Christ s operating within us, we all love one another, and the result is that we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church life is not a matter of religious teachings, gifts, regulations, forms, or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Galatians 3:28 says, There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here there is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we should never argue about such matters as who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both right and wrong avail nothing; Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all, both young and old, must be saved from religion as the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord have mercy upon us so that our veils can be removed, that we may with unveiled face behold the living, indwelling, and transforming One to have a wonderful, direct fellowship with Him 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Out of this experience we will have the church life, not according to religious teachings, gifts, regulations, forms, or ordinances but by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It pleased God to reveal His Son in us, all our veils are being removed, and we see only God s eternal purpose Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not care for anything other than this.</S>
