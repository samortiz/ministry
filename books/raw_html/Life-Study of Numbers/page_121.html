<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JOURNEYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(16)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 21:4-9; 20:1, 22-29; 27:12-14; 20:14-21; 21:10-20; 33:1-49</H1><P>In chapters twenty and twenty-one of Numbers, there are some important matters which we need to see. These matters are treasures, and we need to have the insight to see their preciousness. For example, Numbers 20 shows us the divine way to receive the divine supply, the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit. In the New Testament we do not have a chapter that reveals as clearly as Numbers 20 the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Philippians is a book on receiving the bountiful supply of the Spirit, but not even in this book do we have the precious matter revealed in Numbers 20. In this message we will endeavor to see the treasures in Numbers 21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Speaking against God and Moses</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Because the Way Was Hard,<br>the People Being Impatient<br>and Speaking against God and Moses,<br>Mainly concerning the Food Supply</H2><P>It is enlightening to compare Numbers 20 and 21. Both chapters speak of the people's contending. In Numbers 20 the children of Israel were contending for water. This contending was fair because it came from the people's thirst. In Numbers 21 the children contended again, but this time their contending was not fair, because it came from the people's impatience. God did not punish the people for their contending in chapter twenty, but He did punish them for their contending in chapter twenty-one.</P><P>God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and had brought them into the wilderness, where the way was rough and very difficult. "The soul of the people became impatient because of the way" (21:4b). The way was harsh, and their patience was exhausted. In their impatience they "spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread and no water, and we loathe this contemptible bread" (v. 5). From God's point of view, this contending, unlike the contending for water, was not fair. God had not promised that the way through the wilderness would be easy. They should have anticipated a difficult journey. Therefore, God was not happy with them and He punished them.</P>
