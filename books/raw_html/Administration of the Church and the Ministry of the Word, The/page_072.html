 <h2 class="head1">AVOIDING AN ATTITUDE OF SUPERIORITY<br />
IN THE WORK</h2>
<p>It is a problem that the brothers from the West have an attitude of superiority. However, we should not oppose them because of this, nor should we react negatively or look down on them. The only serious problem is our differing view concerning the ground. Their superior attitude hindered further fellowship. Even though this was unintentional, it was revealed unconsciously in their behavior.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. Because I am from northern China, I unconsciously speak with a northern accent. I do not intend to speak with a northern accent, but as I speak, the accent comes out. I was born and raised in northern China, I also lived there for many years. I am composed of the elements of northern China. Unless I am transformed, my northern accent will always be with me. As long as I live, I will unconsciously have a Chinese flavor and a northern Chinese accent. Similarly, the various influences of international politics over the past one hundred years and China&rsquo;s position in international politics has caused the brothers from the West to have an attitude of superiority that is difficult to remove. In addition, our history over the past decades has caused us to have an attitude of inferiority.</p>
<p>This is a problem in the East and in the West. I have been praying concerning this matter for a long time. May the Lord cover me with His blood; I would now like to fight against this matter, endeavoring to get rid of these attitudes of inferiority in the East and superiority in the West. May these attitudes no longer exist in the future when the brothers and sisters from the East and from the West come together to fellowship. Presently it is not a problem for the believers in the East to receive the spiritual help from those in the West. We are already doing it. However, the believers in the West will need to be humble in order to receive spiritual supply from the believers in the East. When there is this open fellowship, the Lord will reveal what we have seen to the believers in the West. I strongly believe that soon the brothers from the West will come and live in the East for a period of time in order to learn. They will then understand what the Lord is doing on this earth today. They will understand the way the Lord is taking today. Only time can prove this word.</p>
<p>Many of you brothers are in your twenties. If the Lord delays His return, you will probably live longer on this earth than I will. One day perhaps you will recall this word. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to us, and we should not be proud. We should be clear concerning what the Lord has given to the church over the past two thousand years, and we should understand the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s raising us up in the East in this age. May we be faithful to learn our lessons and labor in the Lord&rsquo;s work, and may we refrain from comparing ourselves with others. As long as we are faithful, the result is up to the Lord, not up to us.</p>
