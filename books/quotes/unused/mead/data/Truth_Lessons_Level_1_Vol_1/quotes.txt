[1]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON ONE THE BIBLE OUTLINE The origin of the Bible: The Bible being God-breathed.
[2]  The Bible being the speaking from God by men borne by the Holy Spirit.
[3]  The Bible being God s speaking in the prophets and in the Son.
[4]  After we are saved, in order to have spiritual growth, we must know the Bible.
[5]  For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible.
[6]  The spiritual inheritance which God has given to us includes, on the one hand, the invisible Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, the visible Holy Bible.
[7]  This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man s thought, man s mind, but rather, it is God s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers.
[8]  Since the Scripture is God s breathing His word out from men through His Spirit, no word of the Scripture can be of man s will; rather, men were borne by the Spirit and spoke out of God.
[9]  D. The Bible Being the Holy Spirit s Revelation
[10]  John 16:13 says, But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
[11]  The Lord s word here also proves that after the Spirit s descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit.
[12]  Hence, the Lord s word here proves that after His ascension, all the books of the New Testament, written by His disciples, were of the Spirit s revelation and their divine authority was acknowledged by Him.
[13]  The Scripture, therefore, is the word written by men under God s command Exo 34:27 , the word of the Spirit of God spoken through men, the word of God spoken through man s mouth 2 Sam 23:2 , and the word spoken by men who were moved by the Spirit Mark 12:36 .
[14]  When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God s life into us; thus, we have God s life and are regenerated.
[15]  The word of the Scriptures is also our spiritual bread of life Matt 4:4 .
[16]  Just as our physical life needs nourishment, so also our spiritual life needs nourishment.
[17]  In order to be living and strong before God, we cannot depend on bread alone, but on every word, that is, the word of the Bible, that proceeds out through the mouth of God.
[18]  THE RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE A. The Old Testament 1.
[19]  The five books of Moses in the Old Testament have always been recognized by the Jews as having come from God and having absolute divine authority, because they were revealed by God, written by Moses, and passed down through the generations by their fathers.
[20]  The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexisting simultaneously from eternity to eternity: The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all being God: The Father being God.
[21]  John 14:16-17 says, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality.
[22]  In these two verses the Son says that He will pray to the Father that the Father may send the Spirit.
[23]  AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE A. The Son Being the Father
[24]  Isaiah 9:6 says, Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.
[25]  In this verse, the mighty God matches the child, and the everlasting Father matches the Son.
[26]  Yes, He is a child, yet He is the mighty God.
[27]  Thus, He created all things entirely according to His will and plan.
[28]  All things were created not by chance, nor accidentally, nor casually, but through God s planning.
[29]  God was going to restore what had been damaged, and was going to have some further creation.
[30]  This means that after God created, some things happened, causing the harmonious and beautiful universe created originally by God to become damaged.
[31]  Hence, the first half of this verse refers to God s original creation, and the second half refers to God s restoration of the earth and the heavens.
[32]  HUMAN LIFE BEING THE HIGHEST LIFE A. Man Being Created according to
[33]  In His plan God ordained that man would possess His life in order to be the brothers of His Son; therefore, in His creation, He caused man to have His image and likeness.
[34]  God created man in three parts spirit, soul, and body.
[35]  After God created man, He did not put the divine life into man.
[36]  We have also seen that something happened between verse 1 and verse 2: God s original creation was damaged, the earth became waste and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
[37]  Isaiah 14:12 tells us that Satan was the Daystar for Lucifer, according to Latin , son of the morning.
[38]  Just as the daystar is the leading one among the stars, so Satan must be the head of all the angels.
[39]  Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan s position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God.
[40]  THE RESULT OF REBELLION A. Satan Being Judged by God
[41]  Man s presumption in forsaking God s way of salvation.
[42]  The process: Serving God according to man s own way inventing a religion of man s concept.
[43]  We have seen that after God made man, He placed man in front of the tree of life, that man might contact the tree of life and receive His life which is the uncreated life.
[44]  The first step in the process of the fall was man s failure to use his spirit.
[45]  After man was created, he ought to have always used his spirit to contact God and live before Him.
[46]  When man lives according to the spirit, he is preserved by God.
[47]  After Adam and Eve sinned, they hid themselves from the presence of God.
[48]  But God came to seek them and promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .
[49]  In the first step of the fall, the enemy of God was outside of man.
[50]  THE FOURTH STEP OF THE FALL A. The Cause
[51]  There are two factors in each step of the fall.
[52]  At the fourth step of the fall, Satan utilized the authority which God gave man to form the nations and to instigate a rebellion against God with the nations.
[53]  God s promise of redemption: The seed of the woman.
[54]  In His eternal plan, God planned to create all things and to have man to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[55]  Furthermore, according to His foreknowledge and foresight, that is, according to His foreknowledge of man s fall, He planned to redeem man after the fall.
[56]  God s redemption was neither an addition to His original plan, nor an afterthought to remedy the problem, but was planned and prepared from the beginning.
[57]  In God s eternal plan, He foreordained that after man s fall, Christ would accomplish redemption.
[58]  In Isaiah 7:14, God more clearly reveals the promise of His redemption.
[59]  On the other hand, it also tells us that this Christ who was to be born of a virgin to be our Savior is God.
[60]  He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth Isa 53:9 .
[61]  He had no transgressions, and He had never committed any sin.
[62]  Man s evil intention was that He make His grave with the wicked, but God s arrangement was that He be buried with the rich Isa 53:9; Matt 27:57-60 .
[63]  In the promise of God s redemption, Christ not only died for us and was resurrected for us, but He also ascended for us.
[64]  Through His death He solves all of our problems; through His resurrection He imparts God s life into us; and in His ascension He brings us into a heavenly position.
[65]  Thus, in the Old Testament, God has made clear beforehand every aspect of His redemption: that He would become a man, that He would live a human life on earth, that He would bear man s sins and suffer death on the cross, that He would be raised from among the dead that man may receive His life and become His brothers, and that He will come again to execute God s judgment against Satan, terminate the age, and bring in His kingdom.
[66]  First, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy Satan who had poisoned man; later, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of Abraham, that all the nations on earth would be blessed; again, He promised that Christ would come as the Lion of the tribe of Judah to defeat God s enemy; He also promised that Christ would come as the seed of David to establish God s kingdom.
[67]  Experiencing the anticipated redemption of God: Through the substitution of the bleeding sacrifice.
[68]  From this lesson on we intend to look into the summary of the Old Testament step by step.
[69]  In this lesson we will examine the portion of the Old Testament from Adam to Noah.
[70]  I. IN ADAM IS SEEN GOD S REDEMPTION A. Receiving the Promise of God s Redemption
[71]  Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve realized that they had violated God s prohibition against eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
[72]  To walk with God is not to override God, not to be presumptuous, not to do things according to our own concept and desire, nor to do anything without God.
[73]  In this lesson we come to the history of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.
[74]  Their combined history speaks of the complete experience of a called one.
[75]  Hebrews 11:8-9 says, By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went out without knowing where he was going.
[76]  By faith he dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents.
[77]  Although Jacob was defeated in his mother s womb by his brother and was born second, he kept struggling to seize the birthright.
[78]  And the Lord stood above the ladder and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed...and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed Gen 28:10-14 .
[79]  The picture we see in all of Isaac s experience is a picture of the enjoyment of the rich inheritance rather than a picture of God s redemption.
[80]  In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.
[81]  God s full salvation includes the Passover, the exodus, and the crossing of the Red Sea.
[82]  Through the enjoyment of the Passover and the baptism in the Red Sea, the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt and entered into the wilderness.
[83]  Having enjoyed the supply of the Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, they were strengthened to go out of Egypt, to cross the Red Sea, and to enter into the wilderness.
[84]  Then through the tree which caused the bitter waters to become sweet Exo 15:23-25 , the twelve springs of water in Elim Exo 15:27 , the manna from heaven Exo 16:14-15, 31, 32 , and the living water out of the smitten rock Exo 17:6 , God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai.
[85]  On the fourteenth day of the first month the children of Israel kept the Passover in Egypt.
[86]  There they stayed for nine months and received the revelation concerning God and the tabernacle through Moses.
[87]  For several hundred years they had stayed in the darkness of Egypt, without light and without God s word.
[88]  Now, however, under the shining of the light, they lived according to God s revelation and built the tabernacle according to the pattern revealed by God.
[89]  After the completion and erection of God s tabernacle, it was immediately filled with the glory of God.
[90]  On the third day of their journey at the place of Taberah, they began to murmur Num 11:1-3 ; they murmured again for food Num 11:4-35 ; they spoke against the leader appointed by God Num 12 ; they did not believe that God promised to give them the land of Canaan Num 13:1 14:38 ; they did not obey God s righteous judgment Num 14:39-45 ; they did not obey the authority and the office arranged by God Num 16 17 ; they murmured because of thirst Num 20:2-13 ; and they murmured again due to the difficulty in the journey and the shortage of food Num 21:5-9 .
[91]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON TEN A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 4 FROM MOSES TO SAMUEL 2 In Aaron are seen the priesthood and the offerings: Aaron typifying Christ as the High Priest.
[92]  But because of Moses petition, they were able to escape God s destruction.
[93]  The purpose of God s calling was not only to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, but also to bring them into Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey Exo 3:8, 10, 17 .
[94]  The children of Israel were redeemed through the Passover, delivered out of the tyranny of Egypt, and brought to the mountain of God to receive the revelation concerning the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God.
[95]  After the children of Israel possessed the land as their inheritance, they did not obey God s word to utterly drive out and destroy all the seven tribes inhabiting Canaan Judg.
[96]  The children of Israel forsook the Lord God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed the gods of the people that were around them.
[97]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON ELEVEN A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 5 FROM DAVID TO THE CAPTIVITY In Boaz is seen one valuing the God-given birthright and ushering in the king who established the kingdom David.
[98]  In David is seen one doing God s will and one after God s heart, conquering the enemies to establish God s kingdom for the building of God s temple: Doing God s will.
[99]  In the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel are seen the rise and fall of the kings being dependent on their relationship with God, and God s forbearance, endurance, and righteous judgment toward them: The kings of Judah.
[100]  The birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship, that is, the right and position to enjoy Christ fully with the privileges to be a priest to bring man to God and a king to bring God to man.
[101]  Unfortunately, such a condition did not remain very long before God s people fell and became desolate.
[102]  However, God exercised His divine power to preserve the ark and caused the Philistines to return it to the people of God.
[103]  David s intention to build the temple for the Lord was acceptable to God.
[104]  However, as he was a man of war and the land was not yet at peace, God prohibited him from doing so.
[105]  God further showed David the pattern of the temple by His Spirit.
[106]  Moses commanded this in order to preserve the oneness of God s people, for he knew well that the unique place of God s choice and the destruction of places of pagan worship had much to do with the people s fate before God.
[107]  After Jeroboam became king, he wanted to protect his throne and thought that if the Israelites would go up to Jerusalem to worship God, the kingdom could still return to the house of David.
[108]  ARE SEEN THE RISE AND FALL OF THE KINGS
[109]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON TWELVE A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 6 FROM THE CAPTIVITY TO THE RETURN 1 The prophet during the captivity and in captivity Jeremiah: Rebuking the kings and the people for their sins: Forsaking God and disobeying His word.
[110]  The kings scattering God s people and not caring for them.
[111]  Ezekiel seeing the visions in the land of captivity concerning the spiritual recovery of God s people: The vision of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum in chapter one of his book signifying the spiritual revival of God s people.
[112]  In this lesson, we will see Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel, the prophets during the captivity of Israel.
[113]  When God s people fell into the condition of forsaking God, disobeying God s word, and committing adultery in worshipping idols, they spontaneously spoke lies, deceived others, and committed iniquity.
[114]  Jeremiah, on one hand, rebuked the kings and the people for their sins and wanted them to repent; on the other hand, he warned them that they would be taken into captivity, that their nation would be destroyed, and that the cities of Judah and Jerusalem would become desolate.
[115]  In chapter one Jeremiah began to warn the backsliding people of the evil that would be coming upon them, saying, Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
[116]  Daniel and Ezekiel were the prophets in the land of captivity.
[117]  At that time, God s people were carried away, the house of God was destroyed, and the vessels of the house were taken to the house of the false gods Dan 1:2; 2 Chron 36:7 .
[118]  When God puts His Spirit within man, God Himself enters into man, so that within man, there is God.
[119]  Verses 1, 5, 6, and 10 say, ...in the midst of the valley which was full of bones;...thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin....So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
