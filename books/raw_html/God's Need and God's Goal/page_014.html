        <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GRACE THROUGH FAILURES</h2>
<p>When a person who has followed the Lord for many years looks back and considers his past, he will worship the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, all the failures that caused me grief have turned out to be blessings.&rdquo; When we fail, we touch and gain the Lord the most. Persons who have no &ldquo;holes&rdquo; cannot know God&rsquo;s grace; only those who have been broken can know God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>Consider the story of King David. From his youth, whether in the eyes of his father, his brothers, or King Saul, David was pious and blameless. We all admire his condition. However, this pious person did not truly know God&rsquo;s grace or experience His riches; consequently, God loosened His grip on David. Once God loosened His grip, David&rsquo;s integrity fell apart, and his whole being was affected. When he fell, everyone who knew him probably felt that he was finished because of the seriousness of his failure. This was even David&rsquo;s feeling about himself. In Psalm 51 he said, &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice; / Otherwise I would offer it; / You take no pleasure in burnt offerings. / The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; / A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). David said that his spirit and heart were broken. A broken spirit is a sacrifice to God, and a broken heart will not be despised by God. David&rsquo;s spirit and heart were broken not because of misery or suffering but because of his failure, his fall. He hated his failure to such an extent that both his spirit and heart were broken. Despite his failure, God bestowed grace on him because he was a broken person. God can bestow His grace on a person who has a broken spirit and a broken heart.</p>
<p>Some saints have been saved for more than ten years, yet they remain intact, without any change in their being. They seemingly have never fallen or been in trouble; they are complete in themselves. However, such persons have little experience of grace or knowledge of God. Those who experience God&rsquo;s grace and know God are those who have experienced serious failures. Such failures break a person in his spirit and in his heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN THROUGH FAILURES</h2>
<p>There are many mysterious things in the universe. Although we prefer the light of the day, the darkness of the night is often more useful in God&rsquo;s hand. Although we long for situations full of peace, situations full of suffering are often more useful in God&rsquo;s hand. In the same principle, we long for victory, but we have little realization that our failures enable God to give us more grace. We desire to be strong, but we have little realization that our weaknesses enable us to profit from God&rsquo;s riches. God will never remove all our weaknesses; He will allow some weaknesses to remain with us throughout our human life. Those who have some spiritual experience know that when we are strong, it is not easy to experience the Lord. Rather, when we are weak, when we cannot rise up to speak for the Lord, to pray, or to bear responsibility, and when we have no strength to handle difficulties, we experience and enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>Our weaknesses, however, are not as precious as our failures. Did David experience and know more of God before his fall or after his fall? Only after his fall did he know more of God, experience more of God, and gain more of God. Failures cause a person who is whole in himself to be broken. Once he is broken, he can receive the great benefit of God working Himself into him.</p>
<p>A brother who is seemingly perfect and who has never experienced any trouble has little room in his being to receive grace and to know God. Although there is no &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in his being, there also is no entrance in his being for God. Without a &ldquo;hole,&rdquo; it is not easy for God&rsquo;s grace to enter into him. Such a brother can attend meetings in an ordinary way, sometimes sleeping during the meeting and sometimes saying Amen. He can meet week after week, month after month, and year after year, but neither can he go forward or backward.</p>
<p>Another brother may progress very well after his salvation, but then, inexplicably, he falls, backslides, and no longer meets for several years. However, just when we think that he has been lost completely, he will come back, and he will be different than he was before. He will bear the marks of being broken. When he speaks, he will speak with humility and tears concerning his failures, and even though he has been away for several years, his words will help and encourage us more than our words will help and encourage him. I am not suggesting that a brother should not meet for several years in order to be able to give an encouraging testimony of recovery. Rather, I am only pointing out that there will be some genuine breaking and genuine supply in those whom God has led through a period of failure.</p>
<p>Many years ago, there was a brother in northern China who passed through this kind of situation. He fell and could not rise up for several years. After he came back, he said, &ldquo;Brother, it is hard for me to understand why I fell and could not rise up.&rdquo; I responded, saying, &ldquo;It is not difficult to understand what happened. You were a self-righteous and self-justified person who needed to pass through a serious fall, a serious failure. Before your fall, you relied on yourself, boasted in yourself, and had full confidence in yourself. If God had not allowed you to have such a serious fall, how would you have ever known your true condition? You would have never lost confidence in yourself if you had simply not met for a few days. However, since you did not meet for three years, you know your real condition. In your present condition you are a broken person, and your spirit and heart have been broken as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people exhort others to be humble, but this is not helpful. We should be humble, but we should not exhort others to be humble, because such exhortations are futile. We need to realize that genuine humility comes from failures. A fallen and broken person spontaneously is a humble person. Some saints boastfully say, &ldquo;I have never missed a meeting; I have never fallen.&rdquo; Nevertheless, in order for such a person to grow and advance, he needs some experience of failure. The way to receive grace involves failure, and failures come when God loosens the grip of His hand on us.</p>
<p>God is not concerned with our failures because He wants us to know ourselves and to have no confidence in ourselves; He wants our spirit and our heart to be broken. God treasures and desires a broken spirit and a broken heart because those who have a broken spirit and broken heart will be able to enjoy Him as grace. God&rsquo;s greatest desire is that we would experience and enjoy Him, fully tasting of all that He is and has. However, we are incapable of complying with God&rsquo;s desire. We think that we are able and sufficient; we rely on ourselves and have confidence in ourselves. Therefore, God is willing to loosen His grip and to allow us to fall and fail like a prodigal son.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
