   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 33-37:This section speaks concerning not swearing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James 5:12 says, "Above all things, my brothers, do not swear."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No one is allowed to swear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does James put so much emphasis on swearing?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is because the emphasis of the entire book of James is the matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Men always like to use different ways to prove the honesty of their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not swearing means that a Christian's word should be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should not use any extra effort to prove his word in order to convince others of his credibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Swearing includes speaking "anything more than" yes and no.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 38-42:This section is on not resisting one who is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today is the time for us to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The following are three kinds of persecutions: 1 Concerning one's physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a Christian to endure the first slapping is not something special.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is special of a Christian is that he is ready to receive the second slapping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Christian does not stop at simply not resisting; he goes further by joyfully giving himself over to be slapped again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The degree of one's power is not determined by what one can do; rather, one's power is measured by what one can endure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Colossians 1:11 says, "unto all endurance and long-suffering."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The many items that were required in the foregoing word are simply "unto all endurance and long-suffering."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Turn to him the other cheek also" indicates endurance to the utmost degree, that is, being ready to be slapped again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should allow the life within to be expressed in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not that you try to endure by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mentioning of "right cheek" and "the other cheek " does not mean to turn our cheek to the right or to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, it means to endure the first slapping and be willing to be slapped again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what it means to "turn to him the other cheek also."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the life of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 Concerning one's property.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The lawsuit here against the defendant is most unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the Lord means here is that the suit is not merely to get the tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, the suit is to get everything, including even the tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord said to yield the cloak too.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are preserved by the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Besides this, none can raise his own hand to protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3 Concerning one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here it says, " Whoever compels you to go..."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Compel in Greek is a technical term used in the military.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blessings of a Christian issue from his turning the other cheek, yielding the cloak, and going the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the principle of the second.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Very often we cannot even go one mile.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only those who follow the principle of the second will be glorified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All those who will reign with the Lord in the future are those who would not reign today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In conclusion, here in verse 42 Christ did not tell us to choose those to whom we should give.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ only commanded us to do our part.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can only take care of what God requires of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot take care of what God requires of others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 43-48:This concerns the motivation of love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The actions taken in the preceding verses are caused by love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are indignant about injustice, we cannot pray for those who persecute us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The love here is neither love out of one's preference nor love out of one's affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, it is love out of one's compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are four kinds of love: affectionate love, preferential love, respectful love, and compassionate love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not close our compassionate heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 44:"Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only by so doing can we become children of the heavenly Father and express the nature of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 45:"Because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By this we see how generous God is toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God were like us, no one would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only God can forget men's evildoings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man has no ability to forget because man does not have absolute forgetfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"So that you may become" has the sense of "so that you may be manifested as."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verses 46-47:Without the deeds described in the above verses, we cannot receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A greeting many times expresses an attitude of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 48:"You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Perfect" here refers to being perfect in love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot be perfect as God is perfect in nature, power, wisdom, glory, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God requires us to be perfect only in our deeds of love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be perfect here does not mean to eradicate sin, since the preceding verses in this section are concerned not with punishment but with the deeds of love.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In parallel to this word, Luke 6:36 says, "Be full of compassion, even as your Father also is full of compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By this we see that Luke interprets "perfect" here in terms of compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here it cannot mean that we should be perfect as God is perfect in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible tells us to be righteous toward ourselves and to be perfect in love toward others as God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The clause "it was said to the ancients" is used in verses 21 and 33.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, it is changed to "it was said."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since the word concerning "hate your enemy" is not plainly written in the Old Testament, the Lord said that "it was said" and not that "it was said to the ancients."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although "a tooth for a tooth" is written plainly in the Old Testament, it was spoken to the judge and not to the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, at that time, the scribes and the Pharisees had already taken this word as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, the Lord did not say here that "it was said to the ancients," but He was quoting the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, He said that "it was said."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In chapters one through five we see the following principles of Bible interpretation:</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Example 1: If a conjunction is used between words, and if the part that comes before the conjunction is interpreted according to its spiritual sense, then the part that comes after the conjunction should also be so interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Likewise, if one part is interpreted according to its literal sense, the other part should also be so interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The interpretation should be consistent for both parts.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Example 2: A teaching with few supporting Bible verses should not be sacrificed for another teaching with many supporting Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Example 3: All the words in the Bible should be interpreted literally unless the literal interpretation is nearly absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Parables, visions, and signs should not be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Everything else should be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Example 4: It is not sufficient to determine a truth based on one Bible verse alone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There should always be the "Again, it is written."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Example 5: Two words or phrases that are similar should not be interpreted in the same way if their contexts are different.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Example 6: All parallels are equals.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Example 7: In interpreting the Bible one should not be bound by the background, nor should he ignore the background.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Example 8: One Bible verse alone cannot cover all aspects of any truth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For example, no one can find out all aspects of the truth concerning the law from one Bible verse alone.</S>
