   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE THE PEACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARBITRATING IN OUR HEART Scripture Reading: Col 3:12-16; Eph 2:14-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Colossians 3 and 4 there are a number of points, arranged in an excellent sequence, related to the proper Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would have a proper Christian life, we first need to set our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have pointed out, these things are related to what Christ is doing in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the High Priest, Christ is interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the heavenly Minister, He is dispensing the riches of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the divine Administrator, He is executing God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ s ministry in heaven is for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He desires to build up the church so that He may have His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our Christian walk we need to set our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SWITCHING ON TO THE DIVINE TRANSMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FOR THE RENEWING OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the setting of the mind on the things above is the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apparently there is no connection between setting our mind on the things above and the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, according to our experience, these two matters are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The renewing of the new man is fully dependent on our setting the mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason for this is that a spiritual transmission is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we set our mind on the things above, we open our being to what is taking place in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also respond to Christ s ministry in heaven and reflect it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simultaneously, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit flows into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This transmission may be illustrated by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant; on the other hand, it is in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Between these two ends, the power plant and our homes, a transmission is taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This transmission is called the flow of the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The current of electricity is actually electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same principle, between Christ in heaven and us on earth, there is a divine transmission, the flowing of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By means of this transmission, heaven and earth are brought together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those with experience realize that this is not a dream or a religious superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a divine, heavenly, and spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The heavenly electricity is flowing, and it joins heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the issue of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 3:14 indicates that Christ has redeemed us so that we may receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ accomplished redemption not merely to save us from sin, but even the more to impart Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord that in the universe there is a wonderful, heavenly, divine electricity the life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we open our being and set our mind on the things above, this Spirit transmits the riches of the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All we need to do is switch on and the heavenly current flows.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way to switch on is to set our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This causes the heavenly transmission to function in our experience to bring the divine essence of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more this essence is added into our being, the more we experience the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Renewing is different from teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may be taught about God without having anything of the divine substance added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Renewing depends on the transmission of the divine substance into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more the divine element is added to us, the more we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most of today s Christians do not experience this renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What they have is merely teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the Lord s mercy, our aim in His recovery is not to pass on mere teachings, but to help the saints to experience the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the ministry we wish to share the revelation from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then as the saints have the hearing of faith and open to the Lord, switching on by setting their mind on the things above, they will be supplied by the heavenly transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At times we may be sad or depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if we open to the heavenly transmission, we shall be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may even want to shout and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason for this change is that the heavenly transmission brings the divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what produces the renewing, which affects our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is crucial for us to see the connection between the renewing of the new man and setting our mind on the things above.</S>
