   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPENTANCE IN MAN'S MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIFFERENT FROM REPENTANCE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The repentance that man talks about simply speaks of one thing: he is not willing to lower himself to the bottom rung.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He thinks that he should be at least one rung higher before God would grant him salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is repentance according to man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not the repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am not saying that there is no doctrine of repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the doctrine of repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible even demands that man should repent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the repentance that the Bible talks about is different from the repentance that we talk about today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then is the repentance that the Bible talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the meaning of the word repentance in Greek is a turning of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mind is the thinking organ within man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, repentance as taught in the Bible is not a change in conduct, but a change in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word repentance just means a change in one's thoughts and has nothing to do with works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not have any connotation of a change in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is as far as the meaning of the word goes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, in the New Testament, repentance is always used in reference to our past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It concerns what we have done in the past, what we have thought and said, and what we were as persons in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, we had certain kinds of concepts and certain views which we considered good and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, through the enlightening of God, our mind has a great turn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a turn with a view to future conduct, but a change from things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We change our view and evaluation concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Originally, we thought that it was a glory and a joy to deceive others and that the one who was deceived was such a fool because he was ignorant of being cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One might delight and glory in this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But what he once considered glorious, now he considers shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Repentance is not for the good of tomorrow, but for the wrong of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repentance is not saying what one should do in the future; it is a reevaluation in the mind, a changed view, and a different judgment concerning the things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Luke 13:3 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they did not repent of what they did, they would die like the Galileans did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, repentance is to take a different view than before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is to see things in God's light, a light that is from above.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts we see the word repentance used many times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 8:22 says, "Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Simon was trying to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit with money, and Peter replied with a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told Simon that he had to repent of his wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that Simon should do better in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means that Simon should repent of what he has just done, what he has just said, and what his thoughts have been.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Repentance is to deal with one's problems of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It means that there were great mistakes in what we did and that we should now have a different view.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Formerly, the thought was to spend a little money to buy the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now, this is seen as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should be done?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is now the need for a new view and a renewed evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this we receive forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word repentance appears frequently in Revelation 2 and 3 in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There, the Lord was dealing with the works of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was calling for men to have a different view concerning their past works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation 2:5 says, "Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord said this because they had left their first love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They did not do the first works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They had to remember from whence they had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After this, they have to do the first works which are something of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One has to repent of what he did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The works in the future are a different matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 16 says, "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord was speaking here to the church in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some had followed the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They considered this teaching to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That is why the Lord said that they needed to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They needed to consider that the work of the Nicolaitans was evil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They needed to change their view and their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 21 says, "And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She had committed fornication, but she would not consider that as wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She would not judge that as improper.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 22 says, "Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This again shows us that they needed to repent of their past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If they did not repent, the Lord would cast them into great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Revelation 3:3 says, "Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here, the Lord is again calling them to repent, that is, to change their view concerning their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 19 says, "As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After seeing how the word is used in Luke, Acts, and Revelation, we can now understand what repentance really means in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Repentance is a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But it is always used in reference to the deeds of the past and is never used in reference to conduct in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Repentance is a change in one's own mind, but what it deals with is in respect to the failures, the sins, the mistakes, the lack of zeal, and the ungodliness of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that we now see all these as wrong and improper.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may say that faith is our looking up to Christ, and repentance is our looking at ourselves in the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>While we are still sinners, the Holy Spirit shines into us and shows us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is most necessary and is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit and the realization of ourselves, we cannot lift our eyes to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The work of repentance is similar to the work of the law that we have discussed in the last few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God's purpose is that man would receive His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He has no light concerning himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He does not know what kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He does not know that he is condemned before God, that he is absolutely useless, and that he is, therefore, unable to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Let us suppose that you are very sick, and your two lungs are completely diseased.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You may say that you still have a fair complexion and that there is color in your face.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You may not think that some good medicine or a good doctor is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now suppose you go to have an X-ray.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After you see the result of your own X-ray, you will admit that you are a sick man and that you need rest and treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, repentance is God's goal in giving the law.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Through repentance, we see by the enlightening of God, the shining of the Holy Spirit, and God's Word, that our past deeds were all wrong and that our lifestyle was improper.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God has diagnosed our illness, and we have to admit that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There was a brother who always carried others' heavy luggage when he traveled together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He volunteered because he thought that others were not healthy, but that he was in good health.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Once, after he had completed a heavy task, I suggested that he should go to the hospital and have an X-ray taken.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>At the beginning he refused.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We argued that it would do him no harm, even if he was not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>So, he went.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He found out that he had tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>From that point on, his behavior completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He dared not do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When we asked him to do anything, he would do his best to decline.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>His change was so drastic that it was as if he were two different persons on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>At one moment he thought that he was so healthy and had such good lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>At another moment his evaluation of himself changed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He had a different view and a different evaluation of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is called repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Repentance is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is the goal which God wants to attain through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we misunderstand repentance to think that it is a change of our future behavior, we are absolutely ignorant of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God's salvation never attempts to improve the Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If repentance referred to the future, it would mean that old Adam and the fleshly man still have the possibility of improvement and advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>But the Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The flesh will never advance to become the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Only that which is begotten of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If repentance refers to the future, then the foundation of God's salvation is completely torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Not only are we not able to improve ourselves, on the contrary, we need to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>God's salvation leaves no room for the fleshly man.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It removes the man completely.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, all men were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Our old man has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Thank God that the Lord Jesus is a tailor who makes clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He is not a mender who mends clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It is not that our clothing is torn and the Lord Jesus comes to mend it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Lord Jesus only makes new clothes; He does not mend old clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Perhaps we are poor, and we are willing to wear old clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>But in the house of God, no one wears a mended garment.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>There is no such thing in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>God said that the first Adam is finished and that all behavior in the first Adam is also finished.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Now, we are in the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Today everything has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus; He wants to be the new life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Therefore, repentance in the Bible does not refer to future behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Rather, it refers to a change in concept concerning our past.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Biblical repentance is a view concerning past deeds rather than future behavior.</S>
