   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN LEADING MEN TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16; 10:14; 1 Tim 2:1, 4; Mark 16:15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we said that once a person believes in the Lord, he has to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to talk about the ways to lead men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not know how to lead people to Christ, I am afraid that much of our witnessing will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are several things which we must do and learn if we want to lead men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can group them into two categories: First, going to God on man's behalf, and second, going to man on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, we would also like to say something about passing out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. GOING TO GOD ON MAN'S BEHALF A. Prayer Being the Foundation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of Leading Men to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a foundational work in leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before one opens his mouth before man, he first must open his mouth before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to first ask God and then talk to men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We always need to talk to God first, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers and sisters are very zealous to lead men to Christ, but they do not pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man may have great interest in people, but if he has no burden to pray before the Lord, his work of saving souls will be ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person must have a burden before the Lord before he can witness to men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said, "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Acts 2:47, the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for men to be saved, we need to ask God and implore Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very difficult to deal with man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not easy for us to turn a heart toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must first go to God and pray for these people, asking God to bind the strong man Luke 11:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Afterwards, we can talk to them at length.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to present these people one by one to the Lord and pray for them fervently before we can effectively lead them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are good at leading men to Christ are good at prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have trouble getting answers to prayer, you will have trouble witnessing for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have no confidence in prayer, you will have no confidence in leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, you must learn to pray in a practical way and not let this matter slip by.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Preparing a Record Book</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to pray for people in a proper way, you should keep a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Allow God to put the names of those whom He wishes to save in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you were first saved, how did you know to whom you should go to make restitution?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How did you know whom you should repay?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was the Lord who put the person's name in your heart and who reminded you of particular things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This reminder compelled you to make restitution with others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day you suddenly thought of something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another day something else came to your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result of this enlightening, you dealt with these things one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same principle holds true in leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Allow the Lord to put some names in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When these names are in your heart, spontaneously you will be burdened to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord may put a few people or a few dozen people in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In writing these names down, the most important thing to remember is to take the names that the Lord has put in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not sit down and simply make out a list at random.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will be wasting your time if you mindlessly write down something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your success will be dependent upon how good your start is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to ask God specifically for a few names.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Out of all your family members, friends, colleagues, schoolmates, and those whom you know, a few names will spontaneously come to your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will have a feeling for them, and you will want them to be saved first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A record book should have the following columns: The first column should be a number; the second column, the date; and the third column, the name.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This will remind us of the number we have assigned to a person and the date we began to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fourth column should also be a date the date when the person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the person unfortunately dies, we can put the date of death in this column.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One should persist and not give up once a name is in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The prayer for a person should follow him until he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the person is alive and not saved, you should keep on praying for him until he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One brother prayed for his friend for eighteen years before his friend was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not certain when a person will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some are saved in a year, and some in two to three months.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps one or two of them may prove to be very difficult, but in the end they will still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You should not relax but relentlessly pursue in prayer for their salvation.</S>
