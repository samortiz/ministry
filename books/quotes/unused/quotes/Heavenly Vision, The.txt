With the history of the apostle Paul there are two parts, two sections: the part before he got saved and the part after he got saved
If we read the New Testament carefully we will realize that before he got saved Paul was a fulltime worker a fulltime servant serving God
He was serving according to the knowledge of the Bible that is according to the letters commandments and regulations of the Old Testament
Before the vision came to him, he took the lead to do things, but after the vision came, he needed others to guide him
After this blindness comes upon us, there will be the inner anointing and the inner shining, the inner enlightening
Anything in the service of God that is not in the spirit but is according to the past is traditional and religious
If we serve merely according to what we know or according to what we remember, our serving will be traditional and religious
In contrast to serving according to the knowledge of the Bible in letters, after he got saved, Paul served in spirit
In Romans 2:29 Paul says, 'He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter'
A person who serves God without having the vision is a person who serves in a natural way with much confidence
One who serves God fervently is not enthusiastic in himself but is fervent, inwardly burning in the Holy Spirit
If you are asked why you are going to the Far East, you should be able to say, 'My going to the Far East is of the Lord's guidance
In the book of Acts the apostles, the sent ones, went out, but it is difficult for us to see what their purpose was in going out
We also need the vision of the church, the vision of the Body, the vision of the self, and the vision of the world
A person may be told how sinful he is and how evil his heart is, and others may point out his shortcomings to him
Only when we have the vision of Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world will we have the reality of what we have heard
We all know this, but to know is one thing and to have the vision of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is another thing
If we see such a vision of Christ, we will never help others to have humility, patience, love, and kindness without Christ
We will testify to others that Christ the essence the substance of our daily walk is humility patience love kindness and good behavior
No matter what kind of service we may do or what kind of ministry we may have, the reality of that service and ministry must be Christ
If you do this, you may find that you have nothing to minister, for your ministry is full of knowledge, forms, and gifts
With many socalled ministries today once the wrappings and the container of teachings forms and gifts are removed there is nothing left
The church life is for nothing other than Christ, and the church life should not express anything other than Christ
In a doctrinal way Christians may talk about Christ, but not even in a doctrinal way do they speak much concerning the church
The work of gospel preaching, the work of edifying the saints, and the work of teaching the Bible should all be for the church
We were saved not for ourselves and not merely for our salvation; we were saved for the building up of the church
We must have the church not in thought, in theory, or in teaching and not even in vision; we must have the church in practice
The New Testament does not say much about the doctrine of the church, but it does give us a full picture of the practice of the church
During the past century and a half, many Christian teachers have said that it is impossible for us to have the real church today
What we have today is just something visible, and according to these Christian teachers this is not the real church
According to the Bible we are now in the dispensation of the church, and the next dispensation will be the dispensation of the kingdom
If we do not have the church during the dispensation of the church, then in what dispensation will we have the church?
We should avoid the complications and all the confusion and simply pay attention to what is revealed in the New Testament
Concerning the church, some brothers who regard themselves as smart like to get into the 'woods,' into the complications
Those who refuse to be simple in this matter but raise questions about the locality of the church end up in the 'woods'
In the Presbyterian denomination there may be a unity, and in the Methodist denomination there may also be a unity
Rather, the unity of the Presbyterian denomination and the unity of the Methodist denomination are each a unity among many unities
In ancient times the people of Israel had a unique unity in the good land of Canaan, with Jerusalem as its center
When we say that the church is expressed in the place where the saints are, we need to define what we mean by place
To go to a so-called local church in a house is to get into division, but to go to a local church in a city is to get into unity
Otherwise, we will have no way to go on with the church and eventually will have to drop the matter of the church
Regarding the church, we need to have a clear vision, and then we must be ready to pay the price for it, even the price of our life
If we want to have a particular building, we must also have the lot on which the building stands, for the lot is the ground of the building
Some may feel that the lot is earthly and has many problems and is too troublesome; therefore, they want the building without the lot
We bow before You to confess that we are still sinful, that we are still in the old nature, and that we are still so much in the self
Lord, deliver us from so many distracting elements and frustrating things and deliver us from our self that we may be truly one in Spirit
Before we consider this vision, however, let us review what we have covered regarding the vision of Christ and the vision of the church
To have the vision of Christ is to see that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God and the center of all things related to God
Christ must be the essence, the substance, of our Christian walk and the reality of our work, service, and ministry
Eventually something like a veil will be opened to you, and within you there will be an inner revelation, an inner unveiling
You may hear about all these matters, but one day the veil will be opened and you will see the vision of Christ
You are now 'shut in' with Christ, kept away from mere knowledge, for your eyes have been opened and you have seen the vision of Christ
If you would be a proper Christian, you need to see not only the vision of Christ but also the vision of the church
Seeing this will not only rescue you from the wrong concept and understanding; it will revolutionize your Christian service
In the New Testament we do not have much teaching about the church, but we surely have the practicality of the church
You will not be settled and your tune will not be constant until you are settled with and on the ground of the unique unity
You need to see that the church is the desire of God's heart, and you need to see that the church is practical and local
By the Lord's mercy many of us have been brought to the ground of the church and are now practicing the church life on the proper ground
Although we have been brought to a realization of the ground of the unique unity, we still need the realization of the Body
We need to see the vision that we are members of the Body and that we need to be built up together and related to one another
The three main portions of the New Testament which speak of the Body are Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and Ephesians 4
People oppose the church, especially the ground of the church, because of the cost involved in coming to the church ground
Today, people may argue with us about the ground of the church, but something within them takes sides with us regarding this
If you are not willing to pay the price, you may go back to the vision of Christ and say, 'It is sufficient that we know Christ
Today some condemn us, saying that we are too much for the church, that we make the church greater than Christ
As an illustration let us suppose that various kinds of material are brought to a certain lot, or site, as the ground
You have not changed concerning the ground, but you may have changed in position, in relationship, again and again
At present they are meeting with a particular group, but tomorrow they may begin to meet with a different group
Others are not wandering among different grounds, but they are wandering in their position on the proper ground
A person who is built up with others may be very strong, but he is properly related to others and constantly has fellowship with others
If you were to speak to them frankly and truthfully in love, they would be hurt and offended because they are so much in the self
Many brothers are afraid to be built because they realize that once they are built, they will be finished, 'wrecked'
It is not adequate that we realize that Christ is everything and then come together to practice the proper church life
Let us suppose as an illustration that some building materials are placed on a particular lot or building site
Our position on the ground of the church will not be stable until we are built into the building, into the Body
Certain brothers and sisters have seen something of Christ and of the church and have come to the ground of the church
We must be built up in the Body, but the hindrance to this building is the self, one of the last things in us to be dealt with by the Lord
If we would see the vision of the self, we need to pay careful attention to Matthew 16:21-26, Luke 9:23-25, and Genesis 3:1-6
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Jesus said to His disciples, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
In these verses there are four things which are closely related to one another: Satan, the mind, the self, and the natural life
He went on to speak about the mind: 'You are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Following this, we have the self in verse 24 and the natural life, here called the soul-life, in verses 25 and 26
In Luke 9:25 the Lord Jesus says, 'What is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself'?
Satan injected sin into the human body created by God, and in this way the body was corrupted and ruined, becoming the flesh
Because sin has been injected into our body and is now in the members of our body, our body has been corrupted and has become the flesh
When the mind, the thought, of Satan was injected into the human soul, the human soul was corrupted and became the self
Such a thought is Satan's bait, and the more you pay attention to this bait, the more you will be hooked by Satan
Next, her will was exercised to make a decision to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
No one can release himself from this binding cord, a cord that is a composition of sin, the self, and the world
In their experience one of the three strands sin has been broken, but the other two strands the self and the world have not been broken
Having the Lord's presence depends on whether or not you are dependent on the Body and are rightly related to the Body
If you are not rightly related to the Body, then no matter where you may be, you will not have the Lord's presence
You do not have the Lord's presence, because you are isolated from the Body, because you are not properly related to the members of the Body
In doing things, our motive, intention, aim, and goal may all be right, but if we are independent, we are in the self
From this we see that the Lord Jesus does not have regard for what we do; rather, He has regard for our dependence on Him
The more they claim that they are doing something for God, the more they have the sense that they are not at peace
Because they do not have peace, they expect others to tell them that they are right and to give them confirmation
Today we are in the Lord's recovery, and the recovery will eventually come to this crucial matter the building up of the Body
These verses show us that the world is against God the Father and that the things in the world are against the will of God
James 4:4 also speaks concerning the world: 'Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
In the first chapter of the Bible, two things are mentioned as necessary for man's existence food and marriage
After the first step of the fall, man realized that he was naked, that he was sinful, and thus there was the need of clothing
After the second step of the fall, man became preoccupied with the physical body, and there was the need of housing
After the second step of the fall, the fall from the soul into the flesh, man became fleshly , and this eventually brought in the flood
His understanding was corrupted by sin, he became conscious of evil, and he felt the need for something to cover him
After the second step of the fall, man began to care mainly for his body and started to build houses for himself
If we look at the life of the Lord Jesus, we will see how simple He was regarding the necessities of human existence
Just as the flesh is the corrupted body and the self is the corrupted soul, so the worldly things are the corrupted earthly things
The earthly things which are necessary for human existence have been corrupted by Satan with his systematic scheme
Marriage was ordained by God for the existence and multiplication of the human race, but marriage has become a preoccupying element
Originally, clothing was allowed by God for human existence, but eventually clothing became another item utilized by Satan to occupy people
All of our human capacity is preoccupied with and occupied by the things of the world, so no capacity remains in us for God
To us the things which we need for our existence may simply be earthly things or they may become a world, a system of Satan
When you become preoccupied with clothing, housing, and transportation, these also become items of the world to you
We will then be able to say with Paul, 'Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them'
To us eating is not an item of the world but merely an item of the earthly things which are necessary for our existence
If the members of our family hinder us from realizing God's will, then, according to the Lord's word in Luke 14:26, we should hate them
Man's body became the flesh, man's soul became the self, and the things of the earth were systematized to become the preoccupying world
Now there is no possibility for God to accomplish anything for His purpose because man has been deadened by the flesh the self and the world
It is by His being the life within us that we are gradually emancipated, released, and liberated from the flesh, the self, and the world
According to our experience, first we are delivered from the flesh, and then we are gradually delivered from the self
Following this, you will see that you need the liberating Spirit to release you more from the self and the world
If we would realize the building up of the Body, we need to be delivered from the flesh, from the self, and from the world
When this is your situation, you will have nothing to do with the world, yet you will still be living on the earth
You will continue to need food, marriage, clothing, housing, and transportation, but none of these things will occupy or preoccupy you
We all need the vision of the world that we may see what the world is and how the enemy uses the world to keep us from realizing the Body
We have pointed out that fallen people are bound by a cord composed of three strands: the flesh, the self, and the world
Sin is nothing less than the sinful nature of Satan injected into the human body, which had been created by God for His purpose
In Romans 6 and 7 sin is personified and likened to a living person who dwells in us, works in us, and reigns in us
The human body has become the flesh and the human soul has become the self, but what has happened to the human spirit?
There seems to be nothing wrong with the human spirit, for, in contrast to the body and the soul, there is nothing evil or sinful in it
In the same principle, Satan has changed the earthly things the things that were originally on earth for man's existence into worldly things
Satan has systematized all the earthly things that are necessary for human existence, organizing them into one system, the world
In a university there may be a school of medicine, a school of law, a school of business, and a school of liberal arts
All the students in the university are systematized according to their major, and they study in one of the many schools
They also had the vision of the church and realized that God would gather together His chosen ones and build them up as local churches
They not only prayed, but they also consecrated themselves to the Lord, offering themselves to Him in a very real and practical way
Three and a half years earlier, the Lord Jesus came to Peter by the seashore, and Peter offered himself to Him
At the seashore Peter gave up his job, indicated by his leaving his fishing nets, but in the upper room he gave up much more
The first item of their consecration in the upper room was to give up the traditional religion of their forefathers
You may talk much about consecration, but this may be a consecration at the seashore, not a consecration in the upper room
At the seashore you gave up something to follow the Lord Jesus, but you may not have yet come to the upper room
Will you be able to stand before the Lord at the judgment seat and tell Him that you have not seen any of these visions?
Surely you have seen something concerning Christ the church the Body the self and the world and thus you are without excuse in this matter
We are concerned only with the third of the three things which the Lord counsels us to buy eyesalve to anoint our eyes that we may see
Perhaps in a sense you have not seen the heavenly vision but as soon as you are willing to pay the price to buy the eyesalve you will see
If you are not willing to come into the upper room, no matter how many messages you hear, you still will not be able to see
If you say this to the Lord, the heavens will be opened, the scales will fall from your eyes, and you will see the heavenly vision
If you pay the price for the heavenly vision, you will 'burn the bridges' behind you and will have no way to go backward
Suppose that one day an offer is presented to you, an opportunity to have a better position or a better future
The Lord's move was with those in the upper room, with those whose eyes had been opened and whose hearts had been touched
If you are not willing to come here, then what you have read in these chapters will have nothing to do with you
