   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE TWO THE REPRODUCTION OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam 7:12-14; John 12:24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I have the burden to speak a word on a very striking matter the reproduction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>MAN CREATED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ACCORDING TO GOD S KIND</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After God created the heavens and the earth, one of the angels rebelled and became God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This ruined God s original creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, God came in to repair, remodel, and restore the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this restoration God created billions of living creatures, including all kinds of birds and animals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although God created so many living creatures, not one of these creatures was like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So God made man in His image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, man was not created according to his own kind but according to God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not create mankind; He created man according to God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After God finished the creation of Adam and his wife, He looked upon everything that He had made.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As He looked upon the earth and everything in it, only Adam and Eve were His delight, His hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only they could make God happy because only they were His kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God looked at Adam, He might have said, I am pleased to see man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is My hobby; this is My kind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, God s hobby was far from complete because at that time man had only God s image and God s likeness but not God s life and God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man had God s image, but he did not have God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GOD BECOMING A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to His eternal plan God Himself had to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is almighty and omnipotent, but He never does things in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have an idea and then act upon it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is very slow and full of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He made an economy in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later He repaired and restored the ruined creation, and as the last work in His restoration and further creation, God created man, His hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet that was not God s real hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s real hobby is that God Himself would become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Adam s fall and after promising Eve that He would come as the seed of the woman Gen 3:15 , God waited thousands of years before becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I had been His companion, I would have said, God, since the desire of Your heart is that You become a man, why would You not do this right now?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You told the fallen man that You would come as the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why would You not come as this seed today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God had been asked such questions, He might have said, I am not small like you are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am great, and with Me a thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Approximately two thousand years after making the promise in Genesis 3:15, God promised Abraham a seed that would be a blessing to all the nations 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God seemed to be saying, Abraham, you will have a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This seed will be I Myself becoming a man to be the blessing to all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unable to be patient, Abraham followed Sarah s suggestion that he have a child by her handmaid, Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of producing the promised seed, Abraham produced a wrong one, Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God, however, continued to wait before becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After another thousand years, up to David s time, God still had not come as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But God told David that he would have a seed who would be God s Son 2 Sam 7:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Son is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God prophesied to David concerning this seed, but He still did not come as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, after another one thousand years, four thousand years after the creation of Adam, God came to be a man, conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin Matt 1:20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He grew up for thirty more years, but no one knew that He was God become a man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE ONE GRAIN PRODUCING MANY GRAINS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day the Lord Jesus, the God-man, said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to become many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These many grains are actually many gods as the reproduction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first grain the first God-man was a prototype, and the many grains the many God-men produced by this one grain through death and resurrection are the mass reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reproduction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When some hear that God has been reproduced, they may be shocked and say that such a word is nonsensical.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, this is what is revealed in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s real hobby is to have His reproduction in many nations around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is in this reproduction, and His reproduction has His life, His nature, and His constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a great matter this is!</S>
