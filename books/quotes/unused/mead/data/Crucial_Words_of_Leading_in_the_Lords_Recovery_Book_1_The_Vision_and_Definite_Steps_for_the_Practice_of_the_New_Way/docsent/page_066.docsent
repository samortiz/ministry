   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO MEET IN THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all need to learn how to have meetings with people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The co-workers need to learn, the elders need to learn, and the full-timers need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, the sisters need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should learn to go to people s homes to have meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not need to wait until they have the burden and the desire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as one is a believer and as long as he or she has a home, we need to work on the home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they do not know how to have a meeting, we should lead them and teach them to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If for any reason they have difficulty starting a meeting, we should help them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should continue persistently time after time until they are able to sustain a meeting in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After that we can hand the meeting over to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such meetings are not primarily for the relatives and neighbors but for the members of the family, especially for the husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps the couple has not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we bring the meeting to their home, they will be touched by the Lord to start meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is one lesson that all the co-workers, elders, and full-timers must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would also speak a word of advice to the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the past we were accustomed to taking care of the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we have a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are asking everyone to work on the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we need to work on every saint s home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only must we recover the dormant ones, but we must also recover their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although many brothers and sisters are not co-workers, elders, or full-timers, they do have a heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are about three thousand such saints in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they all form units of three, we will have one thousand units which can carry out meetings in others homes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every Saturday we will have one thousand teams of saints looking for people to work on, whether they are dormant ones, weak ones, or indifferent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can even send a meeting to the home of a gospel friend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will not graduate by doing this only once.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a practice must be sustained in a steadfast way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the process of doing this, we must learn to take care of other things, such as the arrangement of chairs, the provision of food, and the preparation of the refreshments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also must learn to choose the hymns and exercise to follow the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do this, I believe the result will be more than we can think or imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Helping Every Attendant to Function</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another secret to the success of the small group meeting or home meeting is the singing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is especially crucial among the older ones, those who are more than forty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have many good hymns among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times we do not need to sing the entire hymn; we can sing only one stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we go to a home meeting, our singing with a released spirit will stir up the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most crucial thing is to help every attendant of the meeting to function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can take the lead to pray and afterward ask the brothers and sisters to pray one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If some express reluctance, we can help them along.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can also encourage them to give a testimony of their salvation and to tell the story of their experience of the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will rekindle the love for the Lord within them and fire them up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It will also stir up the heart of the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Learning to Use Proper Material</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time we have a home meeting, we must provide the proper material for the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must all learn to use such material.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not be legal or inflexible in using the material.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At times we may come to deep and lofty points.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Depending on the actual need, we may want to skip over some of these points or cover them in a brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any Scripture reference listed at the beginning of a lesson or chapter should be pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ultimately, we still need the supply of the Lord s word for spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do this, the meetings will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Preparing before Going to the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we go to a home meeting, we need to pray before the Lord, confess to Him, and ask for His cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to wash our hands every day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot say that since we washed our hands yesterday, we do not need to wash them again today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nor can we say that since we washed them this morning, we can skip it for now.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every time we contact the Lord, and every time we touch anything concerning the Lord, we need to confess our sins and ask Him for His cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do this not as a formality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We confess our filth, weakness, lack, corruption, and evil from the bottom of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether they are conscious sins or unconscious sins, we must ask the Lord to forgive and cleanse them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The result of such prayer, confession, and supplication for cleansing is the moving and outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to believe that the Spirit of the Lord today is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He lives within us and is also upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After we confess our sins and ask for forgiveness, He will cleanse us with His precious blood 1 John 1:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After such confession, we must exercise our faith to claim His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must believe that He is within us and is also upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We also must believe that every time we are with the brothers and sisters, His presence is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Matthew 28:20 the Lord says, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Lord who is with us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If He is not the Spirit, how can He be with us?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord who is with us in the meetings is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once the Lord cleanses us, we must stand on this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Based on this faith, we should exercise our spirit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether it is singing, praying, speaking, or fellowshipping, the minute we open our mouth, we need to learn to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our meeting is not a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is a holy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whenever we meet, we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For this reason, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to my observation, when the brothers and sisters come together, most of the time they do not exercise their spirit; they do not worship in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is our greatest lack.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Chinese philosophy extols inward substance over outward show so that even if a person is filled with inward substance, he should behave outwardly as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To the Chinese, this is virtue and valor.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But such valor should not be found in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the meetings we need to have inward substance, and we need to have outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Fifty years ago the most famous preacher in China was John Sung, who did not graduate from any theological school.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He received a doctoral degree in chemistry in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When he returned to China, he was called by the Lord to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Around February or March of 1933, he came to Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I went purposely to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He was like a madman.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He would come in either from the front door or from the back door.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Sometimes while everyone was waiting for him, he would suddenly appear and would sing in a loud voice, saying, Down with sin, down with sin; out with Satan, out with Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At that time, even Christian congregations of a thousand people would be completely silent for the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But the minute John Sung sang in this way, every dormant spirit was awakened.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we go to a meeting, we should do the same; we should stir up other people s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must realize that with whatever part of our being we speak, we will touch that same part in others.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we speak in a joyful way, others will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we speak in anger, others will be led to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we speak with our emotion, we will touch others emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we speak with the will, we will touch others will.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Of course, if we speak with our spirit, we will touch others spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is an invariable rule.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we go to the meeting, we are there only for one thing to do God s business.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We are there to stir up people s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we do not exercise our spirit, others spirit will never be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If their spirit is not stirred up, they will not touch God, and they will not receive any supply.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When we go to the meeting, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must always exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some saints are always strong.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>They are always ready to speak and can exercise their spirit without any encouragement from us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But the majority of the saints need encouragement before they will exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When we go to a meeting, that is, when we deliver a meeting to a person s home, the minute we come and the minute we open our mouth, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Once we exercise our spirit, the meeting will be full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Once we speak with the spirit, others spirit will be opened, and they will touch God.</S>
