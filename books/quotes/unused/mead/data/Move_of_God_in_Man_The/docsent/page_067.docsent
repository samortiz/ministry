   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12:24 says that God has blended the Body together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of our different characters, dispositions, intentions, and opinions, it is difficult for us to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, as long as we are in the church life, God blends us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The longer we remain in the church life, the more we will be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can resist God's blending.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the most skillful One; therefore, God has a way to blend us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God is blending, it is difficult for us to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This blending is not outward; it is altogether inward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's blending is God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>F. The Same God Operating All Things in All</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church as the Body of Christ, the same God operates all things in all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 12:6 says, "And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Quite often I propose things to the elders and co-workers because of God's operation within me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God first is living; then He is moving and working within us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have experienced God's living, moving, and working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is busier than we.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is working to blend us and to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>G. God Being among You the Church</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, God's moving in us in the building up of the church will have a consummation: whenever we come together, the strangers who come in will see and admit that God is among us 1 Cor 14:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the outward speaking of the strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, we not only have God among us, but we also have God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even our meeting is God's moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the building up of the church by God's moving in man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire history of the church is a part of the history of God moving in man.</S>
