<h1 class="title">The Vision of the Building of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16; Rev. 21:2-3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The entire Bible is a book of building; the main subject of the Bible is the building of God&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 21:2-3.</li>
<li>The central and divine thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a divine building as the mingling of Himself with humanity&mdash;a living composition of persons redeemed by and mingled with Himself&mdash;Exo. 25:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to have a group of people built up as a spiritual building to express God and to represent God by dealing with His enemy and recovering the lost earth&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
	<li>Whatever God is doing today&mdash;in preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or establishing churches&mdash;is part of His building work; these activities are part of God&rsquo;s main work, the work of building&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>We need to be enlightened by and fully saturated with the thought that in this universe God is doing only one thing&mdash;building His eternal habitation&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; Rev. 21:2-3.</li>
	<li>For the sake of His coming back, the Lord needs the church to be built up; only the church built up according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire can be the stepping stone into the age of the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 16:18, 27-28.</li>
	<li>To be built up with fellow believers is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme and highest requirement of His faithful seekers according to the divine oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;John 17.</li>
	<li>Being built up with fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of one who pursues after Christ according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Phil. 3:7-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building of God is the Triune God as life wrought into us continually so that under His transfusion and infusion we become His corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 3:17a, 19b, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the mingling of God with man, that is, God mingling Himself with us; thus, the church is God&rsquo;s building composed of Himself as the divine material mingled with man as the human material&mdash;John 14:20; 15:4a; 1 John 4:15; Eph. 3:17; 1 Cor. 3:9, 11.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16; John 17:22; Eph. 3:19b, 21.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the enlargement, the expansion, of God to express God in a corporate way&mdash;John 3:29a, 30a; Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the building is what God desires, the entire Old Testament is on the subject of God&rsquo;s building:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The account of Jacob&rsquo;s dream at Bethel is the most crucial word in the revelation of God, including the whole Bible in its scope and requiring the rest of the Bible to explain it&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Genesis 28:10-22 is the first place in the Scriptures where God reveals that His intention is to build Himself together with man and to have a dwelling place, a Bethel, on earth.</li>
		<li>In Genesis 35 the vision of Bethel came again, not as a dream but as a reality; in Genesis 35 there is a crucial and radical turn from the individual experience of God to the corporate experience of God&mdash;the experience of God as the God of Bethel (v. 7)&mdash;Eph. 3:17-21; 4:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>According to the book of Exodus, God&rsquo;s building is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;25:8-9; 40:1-38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The purpose of Exodus is to show that the goal of God&rsquo;s full salvation is the building up of His dwelling place&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2, 4-5; Eph. 2:1-22.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s chosen people are to be built up together into one entity, the tabernacle, where God and man may mutually meet, communicate, and dwell.</li>
		<li>In Christ we and God, and God and we, are built together, meet together, and dwell together; this is the central thought of the book of Exodus.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s dwelling place must be built according to the pattern revealed on the mountain&mdash;Exo. 25:8-9; Heb. 8:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The tabernacle and the temple typify two aspects of the church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness and was transitory in nature; the temple was designed for the kingdom and was eternal in nature&mdash;Exo. 40:2; 1 Kings 6:2.</li>
		<li>The tabernacle typifies God&rsquo;s church on earth, whereas the temple typifies the church as Christ&rsquo;s unique Body; the church appears in different localities, yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body, which is unique and eternal&mdash;Rev. 1:11; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		<li>The temple is a type of Christ and also of the Body of Christ:</li>
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The temple first typifies Christ and then the church, as the unique building of God in the universe&mdash;Matt. 12:6; 1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
			<li>These two&mdash;Christ and His Body, the church&mdash;are the center, the reality, and the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;5:32.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The temple replaced the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth; thus, the tabernacle was mingled with the temple&mdash;1 Kings 6:2; 8:1-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God charged Ezekiel to show the people of Israel the pattern of His house, because He intended to examine their living and conduct according to His house as a rule and pattern&mdash;Ezek. 43:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The building of God is a pattern, and we need to examine ourselves in light of this pattern&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
		<li>Our behavior and conduct should be examined not only according to moral regulations and spiritual principles but also according to the house of God&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s requirement is according to His house, and we must all be measured and checked according to the building of God&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
		<li>The Body life is the greatest test of our spirituality; if we cannot pass the test of the Body life, our spirituality is not genuine&mdash;1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19.</li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Three Tabernacles</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:8-9; 40:34;<br />
John 1:14; 2:19-21; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; Rev. 21:3, 22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The three tabernacles in the Holy Scriptures&mdash;the type of the tabernacle, the reality of the tabernacle, and the consummation of the tabernacle&mdash;reveal the goal of God&rsquo;s economy to have a corporate people to be His dwelling place for His expression and representation in eternity&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Exo. 40:34; Rev. 21:2-3, 10-11; 22:1, 5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament is a full and complete revelation of the individual Christ as the Head and the corporate Christ as the Body, the church, including many details of the experience of Christ for the church life (as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the tabernacle and the temple were one)&mdash;Exo. 25:8-9; 1 Kings 8:1-11; Heb. 9:4.</li>
	<li>The reality of the tabernacle in the New Testament is the incarnated Christ, the individual Christ, and the corporate Christ, the Body of Christ; through His death and resurrection the individual Christ was enlarged to be the corporate Christ, the church, composed of the New Testament believers as the temple, the house of God, the Body of Christ&mdash;John 1:14; 2:19-21; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:6; 1 Cor. 12:12.</li>
	<li>The consummation of the tabernacle as the conclusion of the complete Bible is the New Jerusalem, a great corporate God-man as the eternal, enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite people&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22; 22:17a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 84 is the secret revelation of the enjoyment of Christ as the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle so that we may be incorporated into Him to become the reality and consummation of the tabernacle:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;At Your two altars even the sparrow has found a home; / And the swallow, a nest for herself, / Where she may lay her young, / O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The two altars&mdash;the bronze altar for the sacrifices and the golden altar of incense&mdash;are the leading consummations of the work of the incarnated Triune God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God for His increase&mdash;Exo. 40:5-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The first altar is the bronze altar for the offering of all the sacrifices (Christ in His crucifixion) to solve all the problems of man before God.</li>
			<li>The second altar is the golden altar of incense (the resurrected Christ in His ascension) for God&rsquo;s acceptance of the redeemed sinners.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Through our prayer at the incense altar we enter into the Holy of Holies&mdash;our spirit (Heb. 10:19)&mdash;where we experience Christ as the Ark of the Testimony with its contents (Exo. 25:22; 26:33-34; Heb. 9:3-4; Rev. 2:17).</li>
		<li>Through such an experience of Christ we are incorporated into the tabernacle, the incarnated Triune God, to become a part of the corporate Christ as His testimony for His manifestation&mdash;Exo. 38:21; 1 Cor. 12:12.</li>
		<li>Through these two altars God&rsquo;s redeemed, the &ldquo;sparrows&rdquo; and &ldquo;swallows,&rdquo; can find a nest as their refuge and a home with God in rest:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The cross of Christ, typified by the bronze altar, is our &ldquo;nest,&rdquo; our refuge, where we are saved from our troubles and where we &ldquo;lay&rdquo; our young, that is, where we produce new believers through the preaching of the gospel.</li>
			<li>When we experience the resurrected Christ in His ascension, typified by the golden altar of incense, we are accepted by God in such a Christ and find a home, a place of rest, in the house of God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>This house is the processed and consummated Triune God united, mingled, and incorporated with all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect to be the Body of Christ in the present age and the New Jerusalem as the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed in eternity&mdash;John 14:1-23; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; / They will yet be praising You. Selah... / O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man / Who trusts in You&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:4, 12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Praising the Lord should be our living, and our church life should be a life of praising&mdash;22:3; 50:23; 1 Thes. 5:16-19; Phil. 4:4, 11-13.</li>
		<li>In the church life we trust in God, not in ourselves or in our natural human ability to work out a solution to our difficult situations&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, / In whose heart are the highways to Zion&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The highways to Zion are the blessed highways for seeking the incarnated Triune God in His consummations, typified by the furniture in the tabernacle&mdash;Heb. 9:2-5; 10:19-22.</li>
		<li>The highways to Zion in our heart mean that we must take the way of the church internally, not merely externally; when we are deeply in the inner life, we will certainly be in the way of the church&mdash;Psa. 42:7; Matt. 6:6.</li>
		<li>Zion is the very spot where God is, the Holy of Holies; the overcomers become Zion, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to build up Zion&mdash;Rev. 21:16; cf. Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20; Psa. 48:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Passing through the valley of Baca, / They make it a spring; / Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings&rdquo;&mdash;84:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The highways to Zion are not external, superficial, or cheap; we must pay a price to take the way of the church; while we are weeping on the highways to Zion, we are being filled with the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our spring&mdash;Matt. 25:9; Rev. 3:18; Acts 20:19, 31; Psa. 56:8.</li>
		<li>As we pass through the valley of weeping, our tears become a spring (John 4:14), and this spring becomes the early rain that covers the valley with blessings; this blessing is the Spirit (Zech. 10:1; Gal. 3:14; Eph. 1:3).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;They go from strength to strength; / Each appears before God in Zion... / For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand... / For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; / Jehovah gives grace and glory&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:7, 10a, 11a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more we go on in the church life, the more strength we will gain&mdash;Prov. 4:18; 2 Cor. 3:18; cf. S. S. 8:6.</li>
		<li>If our service is intrinsically according to God&rsquo;s will in the church life, each day will be worth many days in God&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;Joel 2:25a.</li>
		<li>The blessings of dwelling in the house of God are our enjoyment of the incarnated and consummated Triune God as our sun to supply us with life (John 1:4; 8:12), as our shield to protect us from God&rsquo;s enemy (Gen. 15:1; Eph. 6:11-17), as grace for our inward enjoyment (John 1:14, 17), and as glory for the manifestation of God in splendor (Rev. 21:11, 23).</li>

<h1 class="title">Life and Building</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 11:25; 14:2;<br />
Rom. 8:2; 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 3:6, 9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Life and building are the basic and central revelation of the Bible:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Life is for building, and the building is of life&mdash;John 11:25; 14:2; 1 Cor. 3:6, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Life is the content, and building is the corporate expression of the content.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s goal is the building; life is the procedure by which God obtains the building, and life maintains the building&mdash;Rev. 21:2-3, 9-10; 22:1-2.</li>
		<li>Life is God Himself, and building is the expression of the Triune God as life in a corporate Body&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11; 12:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of life and building for us to be built up as the Body&mdash;8:2; 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 12:12, 27; Col. 3:4, 15; 2:19.</li>
	<li>The kernel of the divine revelation in the Scriptures is that God created us and redeemed us for the purpose of working Himself into us to be our life for His corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 1:7; 2:5, 8, 21-22; 3:16-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see life and building as portrayed in Song of Songs:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through her living in Christ&rsquo;s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes the building of God and its safeguard, the holy city&mdash;6:4a; cf. Gen. 2:8-12, 18-24.</li>
	<li>We become God&rsquo;s dwelling place, His sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, by participating in the four stages of the divine romance revealed in Song of Songs&mdash;1:2-3; 2:14; 4:8; 6:4; Rev. 21:9-10, 16.</li>
	<li>To become the sanctuary of God is to be built up (related to the building up of the Body of Christ) in the growth in the life of Christ with its unsearchable riches unto maturity&mdash;Eph. 4:12-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Old Testament the building of God is typified by Tirzah and Jerusalem; in the New Testament this building is the organic Body of Christ&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is also Christ&rsquo;s wife (5:25-32), will consummate the New Jerusalem, the holy city as the consummation of the Holy of Holies, the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed in eternity&mdash;Rev. 21:2-3, 16, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through the dealing of the cross, we become the sanctuary of God; this sanctuary is the Holy of Holies, which is God Himself&mdash;S. S. 6:4a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we enter into the Holy of Holies, we enter into God and become the sanctuary; that is, we become God in life and nature&mdash;Heb. 10:19-20.</li>
		<li>John 14:23 and Ephesians 3:17 prove that the God whom we are pursuing is making us His duplication; for God to make us His duplication means that He makes us His dwelling place, His Holy of Holies&mdash;Rev. 21:16.</li>
		<li>The lovers of Christ eventually become duplications of God in life and nature but not in the Godhead; this is the fulfillment of God becoming man that man might become God&mdash;the high peak of the divine revelation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see life and building as revealed in the Gospel of John:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gospel of John reveals that the Triune God is dispensing Himself as life into His believers and that the believers, as the result of this dispensing, become the building of God, His expansion, enlargement, and corporate expression&mdash;1:4; 10:10b; 11:25; 14:2-3, 6.</li>
	<li>The significance of the stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Bethel, the house of God&mdash;1:42, 51:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers in Christ, after being regenerated, are being transformed into living stones for the building of the church&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
		<li>The house of God signifies Christ increased through the church built up with the believers as precious stones and with the life-giving Spirit as the oil to be the enlarged house of God (Bethel) for the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream and of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11; 2 Tim. 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In His resurrection the Lord Jesus rebuilt God&rsquo;s temple in a larger way, making it a corporate one, the mystical Body of Christ&mdash;John 2:19-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The body of Jesus, the temple, that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak, but the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16-17; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		<li>Since the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been enlarging His Body in resurrection life; He is still working for the building of His Body under the process of resurrection&mdash;John 2:19-22.</li>
		<li>Christ, who is resurrection and life (11:25), changes death into life for the building of the house of God; our living as Christians is a life of changing death into life for the building up of the mystical Body of Christ&mdash;2:1-21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is a matter of the Triune God, through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, working Himself into the believers in order to be fully mingled with them so that He may build them up as an organism for His dwelling and expression&mdash;14:2-3, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated God constituted with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s coming brought God into man, and His going brought man into God; by this coming and going, He builds up the house of God by building God into man and man into God&mdash;1:14; 10:10b; 14:2-3.</li>
		<li>By the Spirit and through His death and resurrection, the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is building an organism, the church, which is His Body and the Father&rsquo;s house, produced by the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people&mdash;vv. 7-24.</li>
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is built up by the constant visitation to the redeemed elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is in three stages: the stage of God incarnate, the stage of Christ resurrected with His believers to be built up as the church, and the consummate stage&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;2:19-21; Rev. 21:2-3, 9-10.</li>
		<li>We all need to be nourished by the truth concerning the mingling of God with us to produce a mutual dwelling place&mdash;John 15:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>

John 17:21-23; Psa. 133:1-3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We must realize that the Lord loves and wants to have a built-up church, not scattered individuals&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 5:25; Acts 13:22; cf. 1 Kings 8:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The principle of Babylon, apostate Christendom, is that of division, confusion, and scattering; God&rsquo;s people are scattered, with each one going his own way and direction&mdash;Gen. 11:1-9; Judg. 21:25.</li>
	<li>The principle of the Lord&rsquo;s building of His church is that of gathering; we are gathered by the Lord out of all kinds of occupations and frustrations into Himself on the genuine ground of oneness&mdash;Matt. 18:20; Deut. 12:5, 8; 16:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must acknowledge that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body and that God has placed the members in the Body and blended all the Body together&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13a, 18, 24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and as in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, and social rank, be this one Body&mdash;vv. 12-13; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Every believer is an indispensable member of the Body, and &ldquo;God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 12:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should not despise ourselves and covet the work of others&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>We should not be proud and despise others, thinking that we are all-inclusive and that we are better and more useful than others&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God has blended all the different members of Christ together into one Body; to be blended means to be tempered and crossed out, learning how to follow the Spirit to dispense Christ for His Body&rsquo;s sake&mdash;v. 24; cf. 2 Chron. 1:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be in harmony with the fellow believers and be in one accord with the Body in prayer, which issues in the establishment of the church&mdash;Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The two most important matters in the Scriptures are being mingled with God and being one with all the saints; the oneness is like a thermometer&mdash;it can tell us how much we are in the mingling&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5; 1 Cor. 10:17.</li>
	<li>The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness&mdash;Acts 1:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in harmony, in one accord; to say Amen in response to others&rsquo; prayer is an indication of our one accord&mdash;1 Cor. 14:16; 1 Chron. 16:36; cf. Rev. 3:14.</li>
		<li>The way for us to be blended with others is through prayer with the exercise and release of our spirit so that others can hear, understand, agree with, and thus say Amen to our prayer&mdash;<em>Hymns,</em> #846.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does&mdash;John 17:21-23; cf. Gen. 1:26a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The three of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are continually practicing the divine oneness; the beauty and excellency in the Divine Trinity is the oneness, harmony, and coordination in the Divine Trinity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Matthew 12:28 reveals that the Son as the center of the Divine Trinity was altogether not by Himself, for Himself, or to Himself; whatever He did was by the Spirit of God and for the kingdom of God the Father.</li>
		<li>If we want to be coordinated with all the members of the Body in the oneness and harmony of the Divine Trinity, we should follow the pattern of our Head by not doing anything by ourselves or for ourselves; what we do should be by the indwelling, pneumatic Christ as our humility and selflessness for our Father&rsquo;s heavenly kingdom, perfect will, and eternal glory&mdash;6:8-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>John 17 reveals the believers&rsquo; oneness incorporated with the oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;vv. 11, 21, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine life with its source, the divine name of the Father; the Father&rsquo;s name is the source of our oneness, and His life is the element of our oneness, delivering us from the natural realm&mdash;vv. 2-3, 6, 11-12, 26.</li>
		<li>We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine word as the truth that sanctifies the believers from the world; the Father&rsquo;s sanctifying word is the means of our oneness, delivering us from the world&mdash;vv. 14-19.</li>
		<li>We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine glory&mdash;the divine sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature as the divine right to express the Father; the Father&rsquo;s glory is the expression of our oneness, delivering us from ourselves&mdash;vv. 22, 24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 133 reveals the commanded blessing of God the Father on the believers&rsquo; living in the oneness of the Divine Trinity under the spreading ointment of God the Spirit and the descending dew of Christ the Son&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 13:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The anointing oil as the compound ointment is a type of the processed Triune God, the all-inclusive compound Spirit&mdash;Psa. 133:2; Exo. 30:23-25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We are in the oneness which is the processed Triune God anointed, or &ldquo;painted,&rdquo; into our being&mdash;2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:20, 27.</li>
			<li>Day by day in the church life, all the ingredients of the divine and mystical compound ointment are being wrought into us; through the application of these ingredients to our inward being, we are spontaneously in the oneness&mdash;Eph. 4:3-4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The dew signifies the descending, refreshing, watering, and saturating grace of life (1 Pet. 3:7); grace is the pneumatic Christ experienced, received, enjoyed, and gained by us&mdash;Psa. 133:3; John 1:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By remaining in the church life, we are preserved in the Lord&rsquo;s grace&mdash;Acts 4:33; 11:23.</li>
			<li>By the grace we receive on the mountains of Zion, we can live a life that is impossible for people in the world to live&mdash;20:32; 2 Cor. 12:7-9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The more we experience Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the more our natural constitution and disposition are reduced; as they are reduced through our experience of the Triune God with His divine attributes, we are perfected into one for the Father&rsquo;s glory&mdash;John 17:23; Eph. 4:1-3.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We keep the oneness of the Spirit in the constitution of the Body with the Divine Trinity as the source, the element, and the essence&mdash;vv. 4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself; to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to stay in the life-giving Spirit&mdash;v. 3; cf. Exo. 26:26-28.</li>
		<li>The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers; this mingling is the constitution of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>

	<li>We keep the oneness of the Spirit through the perfecting by the gifted members for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 11-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father that we would be perfected into one in the Triune God&mdash;vv. 21, 23.</li>
		<li>In Ephesians 4 the apostle Paul tells us that the Head gave the gifts to perfect the saints until we all arrive at the oneness&mdash;vv. 11-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We keep the oneness of the Spirit by the growth in the divine life, growing up into the Head in all things&mdash;vv. 13, 15; Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be in the common fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ as the believers&rsquo; common portion for the keeping of the oneness of the Body to witness that Christ is neither divisible nor divided&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2, 9-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all the believers as their allotted portion for their enjoyment (Col. 1:12); all the believers should be focused on the unique and undivided Christ as their unique center appointed by God.</li>
	<li>We should concentrate and focus on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him, that all problems among the believers may be solved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must have the common fellowship in the spirit and have the common thinking and common love in one spirit, with one soul, and on one common standing for the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;Phil. 2:1-2; 1:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Dissension among us is due to our not being joined in soul, to our not thinking the one thing in our mind, the leading part of our soul&mdash;2:2.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>We must live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4), setting our mind on the mingled spirit (v. 6) and being indwelt by the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit who imparts life within us for us to put to death the practices of the body (vv. 9, 13):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When our mind is set on the spirit, our outward actions are in agreement with our inner man, and there is no discrepancy between us and God; the result is that we feel living and peaceful within.</li>
	<li>When our mind is set on the flesh and the things of the flesh, the result is death, which causes us to feel uneasy, deadened, and separated from the enjoyment of God; the sense of death should serve as a warning to us, urging us to be delivered from the flesh and to live in the spirit&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be conformed to the death of Christ to have the self, natural man, flesh, distorted disposition, peculiarities, personal preferences and tastes, etc., all crucified with Christ by the power of the resurrection of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is to take Christ&rsquo;s death as the mold of one&rsquo;s life; the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to Christ&rsquo;s experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God&mdash;John 6:57; 12:24.</li>
	<li>Our life should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life&mdash;vv. 25-26; 1 Cor. 15:31, 36; 2 Cor. 5:14-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must magnify Christ through living Him by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21:

	<li>The compound Spirit is in and for the Body and for the priestly service that builds up the Body&mdash;vv. 26-31; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must minister Christ, dispensing Him to all whom we contact&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must live a life of contacting Christ to be infused with Christ and contacting people to infuse them with Christ&mdash;Acts 6:4.</li>
	<li>We must be good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering Christ as the rich supply of life into others for their growth in life and enjoyment of Christ&mdash;1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2; 4:29; Phil. 1:25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must discern the spirit, which is of power, love, and sobermindedness, from the soul&mdash;Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 1:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must fan our God-given spirit into flame, exercising our spirit so that all the parts of our soul (our mind, emotion, and will) come under the control of our spirit; we should always be on the alert to discern anything that is not of the spirit but of the soul&mdash;vv. 6-7; Heb. 4:12; cf.

	<li>All family, social, and national problems are due to the fact that people use their mind, emotion, and will but not their spirit; the divine oneness of the Spirit is in our regenerated spirit&mdash;Eph. 4:3; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Christ is the Builder of the church&mdash;Matt. 16:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the building up of the church is the greatest prophecy in the Bible&mdash;vv. 16-19.</li>
	<li>In His humanity Christ is the material for God&rsquo;s building, and in His divinity He is the Builder&mdash;John 3:13-16.</li>
	<li>After the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens, the building of the church began&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 4:16.</li>
	<li>As the ascended One in the heavens, Christ is directing, managing, the building up of His church on earth&mdash;Rev. 5:6; Eph. 1:19-23.</li>
	<li>Christ, the Head, speaks the words of God, imparts the divine life, and gives the Spirit not by measure&mdash;John 3:29-36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus ministers the instant and present spoken words of God and gives the Spirit not by measure to God&rsquo;s people; He gives the Spirit by speaking the words of God&mdash;v. 34.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;It is blasphemy to keep a following under our control...The more we let go of our following, the more the Bible will be open to us, and the more the anointing will be on the Body&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of John,</em> p. 128).</li>
		<li>If we would have a part in the divine building, we must be those who are listening to the Lord&rsquo;s word, partaking of His divine life, and sharing His Spirit immeasurably&mdash;vv. 15-16, 34, 36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gifted persons, especially the apostles and the prophets, perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ does not build the church by Himself directly but through His gifted members&mdash;v. 11.</li>
	<li>The gifted persons have only one ministry&mdash;to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ; this is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy&mdash;2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12.</li>
	<li>Whatever the gifted persons do as the work of the ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery all the gifted persons should do the work of perfecting, which is for the direct building up of the organic Body of Christ by all the members of the Body&mdash;v. 12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The perfected saints share the burden of the perfecting, gifted persons and build up the church directly&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the saints who have been perfected by the gifted persons become the able members of the Body; such members can do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ&mdash;v. 12.</li>
	<li>The church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is built up by every perfected saint.</li>
	<li>In order to build up the Body of Christ, we need to hold to truth in love and to grow up into Christ the Head in all things&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The entire Body is a builder, building through every joint of the rich supply, through the operation in the measure of each one part, and by the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&mdash;v. 16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians 4:12-16 occupies a special place in the New Testament because it shows the mystery concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body by the Body itself&mdash;3:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When Christ enters into the saints and lives within them, the Christ within the saints becomes the church&mdash;Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The Body of Christ grows by the growth of Christ within us and is built up this way&mdash;1:18; 2:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The love in which the Body builds itself up is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body&mdash;1 John 4:7-8, 11, 16, 19; Rom. 5:5; 8:39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Love is the inner substance of God; when we enter into God&rsquo;s inner substance, we enjoy God as love and enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love, and thereby love others as Christ did&mdash;Eph. 5:25.</li>
		<li>It is in such a love that we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His Body, and are kept from being influenced by the winds of teaching and from bringing in elements that are foreign to the Body&mdash;4:14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ makes His home in the hearts of the saints by strengthening them with power through the Spirit into their inner man unto the fullness of the Triune God for His expression&mdash;3:14-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church is the Divine Being wrought into human beings&mdash;vv. 17a, 21.</li>
	<li>The key to the building up of the church as the Body of Christ is the inner experience of Christ as our life&mdash;v. 17a; 4:16; Col. 1:27; 3:4, 15.</li>
	<li>Christ makes His home in our hearts through the operation of the Triune God; the Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object and goal, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue&mdash;Eph. 3:14, 16-17a, 19.</li>
	<li>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are filled with the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God for the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;vv. 8, 17a, 19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God builds the abodes in the Father&rsquo;s house through the Spirit remaining within the lovers of Christ, and the Father and the Son visit the lovers of Christ to make the mutual abode&mdash;John 14:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is built up by the constant visitation to the lovers of Christ of the Father and the Son with the Spirit, who indwells them, to be the mutual dwelling place of the consummated Triune God and the believers&mdash;v. 23.</li>
	<li>The Father and the Son often come to visit us to do a building work in us, making an abode which will be a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and us; this is the building up of the Father&rsquo;s house through the constant visitation of the Triune God.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The foundation of the church&mdash;the divine building&mdash;is the redeeming and saving Christ, revealed and ministered through the apostles and prophets&mdash;1 Cor. 3:10-11; Eph. 2:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church; no one can lay another foundation&mdash;Matt. 16:16-18; 1 Cor. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the all-inclusive One, and nothing and no one can compare with Him&mdash;Col. 1:15-19; 2:9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
		<li>Only Christ is qualified to be the foundation of the divine building according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;1 Cor. 1:24, 30; 2:2; 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with their revelation received of Christ as the rock and with their teaching&mdash;Eph. 2:20; Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:42:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because the mystery of Christ was revealed to the apostles and prophets, the revelation they received is considered the foundation on which the church is built&mdash;Eph. 3:4-5; 2:20.</li>
		<li>In eternity there will be the unique New Jerusalem, built upon the foundation of many ministries laid one on top of the other, leading to the unique testimony in the unique expression&mdash;Rev. 21:14, 18-20.</li>
		<li>In building the church, God works according to a prescribed and revealed plan&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20; cf. Exo. 25:8-9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The most important thing in our spiritual work is a knowledge of the pattern shown in the mountain&mdash;Heb. 8:5.</li>
			<li>The pattern shown in the mountain is God&rsquo;s plan; if we do not understand God&rsquo;s plan, it will be impossible for us to do God&rsquo;s work&mdash;Eph. 3:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word <em>ground</em> that we use in reference to the church does not carry the denotation of a foundation; rather, it bears the denotation of a site, like the site on which the foundation of a building is laid:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to the divine revelation in the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ&mdash;4:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This oneness is called &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3.</li>
			<li>This oneness is the oneness that the Lord prayed for in John 17&mdash;a oneness in the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ&mdash;vv. 6, 11, 14-24.</li>
			<li>This oneness was imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ, in their regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as the divine life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The second element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique ground of the locality in which a local church is established and exists&mdash;Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; Rev. 1:11.</li>
		<li>The third element of the constitution of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, expressing the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ on the unique ground of locality as a local church&mdash;1 John 5:6; John 16:13:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By the Spirit of reality, who is the living reality of the Divine Trinity, the oneness of the Body of Christ becomes real and living.</li>
			<li>Through this Spirit the ground of the church is applied in life and not in legality.</li>
			<li>By this Spirit the genuine ground of the church is linked with the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 4:3-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Regarding the ground of the church, Deuteronomy 12 corresponds in at least four ways to the revelation in the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Deuteronomy 12 and in the New Testament, we see that the people of God should always be one:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In His wisdom God did not allow His people to have their own choice or preference but required them to come to the unique worship center.</li>
			<li>Regardless of their number, God&rsquo;s children, the believers in Christ, must be one and have the same center for the worship of God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Both in Deuteronomy 12 and in the New Testament, God&rsquo;s way to keep the oneness of His people is to have a place with His name, the unique name&mdash;Deut. 12:5, 11, 21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To be gathered into different names is to be divided, because these names are the base of divisions.</li>
			<li>Not designating ourselves by any title or name, we should be gathered together into the name of the Lord Jesus&mdash;Matt. 18:20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Both Deuteronomy 12 and the New Testament reveal that the place chosen by God for our worship of Him is the place of His habitation&mdash;Deut. 12:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The fulfillment of the type in Deuteronomy 12 is not a matter of a geographic place&mdash;it is a matter of our spirit&mdash;Eph. 2:22; John 4:21-24.</li>
			<li>In gathering together for the worship of God by enjoying Christ, we must gather into the name of Christ, and we must be in the spirit; otherwise, we will lose the proper ground of the church.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In Deuteronomy 12 and in the New Testament, we have the altar, the cross&mdash;Matt. 10:38:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>At the entrance of the church is the cross, and everyone who would come into the church must experience the cross and be crucified&mdash;Gal. 6:14.</li>
			<li>To experience the cross is to be set aside, to be annulled, to be reduced to nothing&mdash;1 Cor. 1:18, 23; 2:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Jeroboam&rsquo;s apostasy broke God&rsquo;s ordination of having one unique worship center in the Holy Land for keeping the oneness of the children of Israel; this apostasy can be considered a type of the apostasy in today&rsquo;s Christendom&mdash;1 Kings 12:25-33.</li>

<li>Song of Songs 1:10-11 reveals that Christ&rsquo;s lover is transformed with the Triune God&rsquo;s attributes by the remaking Spirit in coordination with the lover&rsquo;s companions, the gifted members in the Body of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The seeker&rsquo;s hair being bound into plaits of gold indicates her submission to God through the transformation of the Spirit with God the Father in His divine nature.</li>
	<li>The plaits of gold are fastened with studs of silver, signifying Christ the Son in His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</li>
	<li>The strings of jewels on the seeker&rsquo;s neck signify God the Spirit in His transforming work to become her obedience to God&rsquo;s will.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Song of Songs 3:9-10 reveals that we are rebuilt with the Triune God by the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work in us to become a palanquin of Christ for the move of Christ in and for the Body of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are rebuilt with the Triune God so that our external structure is the resurrected and ascended humanity of Jesus (wood of Lebanon), and our interior decoration is our love for the Lord (inlaid with love)&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14.</li>
	<li>Through our loving the Lord in a personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual way, our natural being is torn down, and we are remodeled with Christ in His redeeming death (its posts, made of silver), with God in His divine nature (its base, of gold), and with Christ as the life-giving Spirit ruling within us in His kingship (its seat, of purple)&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29; 2 Cor. 4:16-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church in the New Testament is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:9) and is built with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12a):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God&rsquo;s life, are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, a farm in God&rsquo;s new creation to grow Christ so that precious materials may be produced for God&rsquo;s building.</li>
	<li>Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God; silver, signifying Christ&rsquo;s redemption, is listed instead of bdellium or pearl because of man&rsquo;s need of redemption after the fall.</li>
	<li>Wood, in contrast to gold, signifies the nature of the natural man; grass, in contrast to silver, signifies the fallen man, the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24); and stubble, in contrast to precious stones, signifies the work and living that issue from an earthen source; all these are not worthy to be used as materials for the divine building (1 Cor. 3:12b).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The New Jerusalem as the greatest and ultimate sign in the Scriptures is an organic constitution of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Its base is pure gold, signifying the divine nature of God; it is the solid foundation of its throne for the divine administration, which is the glorious center from which proceeds the divine and human communication, signified by its street, to reach all its twelve gates&mdash;vv. 18b, 21b; 22:1-2.</li>
	<li>Its gates are pearls, signifying the issue of the secretion of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection&mdash;21:12b-13, 21a.</li>
	<li>Its wall and its foundations are precious stones, consummated by the Spirit through His transforming and building work&mdash;vv. 18a, 19-20.</li>

<li>The work of the divine building is carried out through renewing and transformation&mdash;Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; 4:16; Eph. 4:23; Titus 3:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to be renewed and transformed, and then we can do the work of building&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23, 12, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be renewed is to have God&rsquo;s element added into our being to replace and discharge our old element&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Titus 3:5.</li>
		<li>The renewing Spirit is mingled with our regenerated spirit as one mingled spirit to spread into our mind to renew our entire being&mdash;Eph. 4:23.</li>
		<li>In renewing, we are transferred from the realm of the old creation to the realm of the new creation to be the new man to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
		<li>Transformation is the metabolic function of the life of God in us, by the addition of the element of the divine life into our being, so that we may express the image of Christ outwardly&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>Transformation is for the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man so that we may be shaped in the divine image to be exactly like the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Renewing issues in transformation, and transformation issues in building up; the building up of the jasper wall of the New Jerusalem goes along with transformation&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Rev. 21:18a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The work of the divine building is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life and their being joined together in the divine life&mdash;Eph. 4:15-16; 2:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we grow in the divine life and when we are joined together in the divine life, we are in the building&mdash;v. 21.</li>
	<li>The building of the church as the house of God is by the believers&rsquo; growth in life; the growth in life is the building&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6-9, 16-17; Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
	<li>The boards of the tabernacle typify the believers joined together to be the dwelling place of God; the bars signify the initial Spirit becoming the uniting Spirit, who joins all the members of Christ into one Body&mdash;Exo. 26:15, 26-29; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the uniting Spirit there is not only the divine element but also the human element; here we have both divinity (the oneness of the Spirit) and humanity (the keeping of the oneness)&mdash;Exo. 26:26a, 29b; Eph. 4:2-3.</li>
		<li>The uniting bars signify not the Holy Spirit alone but the Holy Spirit mingled with the human spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4.</li>
		<li>The uniting bars are the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit to become the uniting bond of peace&mdash;Eph. 4:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The members of the Body are fitted together by holding the Head; there are no direct relationships among the members in the Body, for all relationships are indirect, that is, through the Head and under the Head&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The work of the divine building is the believers&rsquo; being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God by the Spirit in their spirit possessed by Christ, both of which are mingled as one spirit&mdash;Eph. 2:22; 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians is a book on the Body, and every chapter contains a verse concerning the human spirit; this indicates that the Body is absolutely a matter in our regenerated spirit&mdash;1:22-23, 17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18.</li>
	<li>Our spirit, as today&rsquo;s Jerusalem&mdash;the place where the God of our spirit dwells&mdash;is universally spacious, including not only our individual spirit but the spirits of all the saints&mdash;Rom. 8:16; Num. 16:22; Heb. 12:9; Eph. 2:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building is by the Spirit&rsquo;s operation, distributing to each member different gifts for the building up of the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 12:4, 7-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God moves in the believers for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God&mdash;vv. 4-6.</li>
	<li>The manifestation of the Spirit is &ldquo;for what is profitable,&rdquo; that is, for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of the Body&mdash;v. 7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building work with gold, silver, and precious stones will be rewarded by Christ at His coming back&mdash;3:12-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The central work of God is to work Himself in Christ into our being, making Himself one with us and making us one with Him&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:16-17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The intrinsic element of the work of the divine building is to minister the building and builded God into others for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 3:17a; 4:4, 12, 16.</li>
		<li>The unique work of the ministry is to carry out God&rsquo;s economy to build Himself into man for the building up of the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;3:9-11; 4:11-12; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A work to which God can fully commit Himself has four essential features&mdash;1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There must be a revelation of the eternal purpose of God&mdash;Eph. 3:11.</li>
		<li>The source and initiation of the work must be of God and not of ourselves&mdash;Matt. 15:13; 1 Cor. 8:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God is the Father, and everything proceeds from Him&mdash;Rom. 11:36.</li>
			<li>In our work we must avoid the sin of presumption&mdash;the sin of acting outside of God to do what He has not commanded and to begin a work that He has not instructed us to do&mdash;Psa. 19:13; Num. 18:1-7.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The continuance and advance of God&rsquo;s work must be by God&rsquo;s power and not our power&mdash;2 Cor. 3:5; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		<li>The result of God&rsquo;s work is for God&rsquo;s glory and not for our glory&mdash;John 7:17-18; 8:50; 12:43; Eph. 3:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If our work in building up the church is by our natural man (wood), by our fallen, fleshly man (grass), or by anything that issues from an earthen source (stubble), our work will be burned&mdash;vv. 12-13, 15.</li>
	<li>We all need to consider how we are building the church; we should be those who are building with the Divine Trinity as the precious and transformed materials&mdash;vv. 8, 10, 12-13.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Cor. 3:16-17;<br />
Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 4:12, 16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The accomplishment of the divine building is the church in many localities as the house of God to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the holy temple in the Lord&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 1:2; 3:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine building has both a universal aspect and a local aspect&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The phrase <em>all the building</em> in Ephesians 2:21 denotes the universal building, the building of the church throughout the universe:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In Christ all the building is fitted together and is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.</li>
			<li>Since the building is living (1 Pet. 2:5), it is growing; the actual building of the church as the house of God is by the believers&rsquo; growth in life&mdash;Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
			<li>In speaking of the universal building, we must distinguish such building from organization; the churches will be built together universally, but they will not be universally organized&mdash;2:21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The words <em>you also</em> in Ephesians 2:22 indicate that the building in verse 21 is universal, but the building in verse 22 is local:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Universally, the church is uniquely one and is growing into a holy temple; locally, the church in a particular locality also is one, and the local saints are being built together into a dwelling place of God in their particular locality.</li>
			<li>Universal building can be accomplished only through local building&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4-5, 12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The building of God is not an ordinary building; it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells&mdash;3:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expression in many localities on earth; each expression is the temple of God in that locality&mdash;1:2; 3:16.</li>
		<li>The temple of God in verse 16 refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality&mdash;1:2.</li>
		<li>The temple of God in 3:17 refers to all the believers universally&mdash;Eph. 2:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>How much building we have universally and locally depends on how much we realize that Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the all-inclusive One, and we should not hold on to anything in place of Him&mdash;1:18; 2:19; 1 Cor. 1:30; 3:11.</li>
		<li>If we hold to Christ as everything to us, we will experience the genuine building, first locally and then universally&mdash;Eph. 3:8; 1:22-23; 2:21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The accomplishment of the divine building is the Body of Christ in the whole universe as the expression of Christ&mdash;1:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;4:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All the churches are one Body, and the co-workers should be doing not a regional work but a universal work for the universal Body&mdash;vv. 11-12.</li>
		<li>Whatever the co-workers and elders do locally or universally should be done with a full realization that they are building up the Body of Christ; thus, they should always keep a view of the Body&mdash;v. 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All the problems of the church today are due to the ignorance concerning the Body of Christ&mdash;1:17-23; 1 Cor. 12:24b-27.</li>
			<li>Whenever we do something, we should have a proper consideration for the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5, 15.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In fact, all the believers in Christ have been baptized into one Body by the Spirit; in practicality, all the believers must be built together into the Body of Christ by the builders of the divine building throughout the age of the New Testament&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:11-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our work is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10; Eph. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is organic, and it is not built up through natural methods or human work&mdash;vv. 15-16.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Whenever God&rsquo;s children see the oneness of the Body, they will also see the oneness of the work, and they will be delivered out of individualistic work into the work of the Body&rdquo; (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 37, p. 244).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Body is universally one; for this reason the local churches should not be isolated from one another&mdash;Col. 4:14-16; Rev. 1:11; 2:1, 7a; 22:16a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Isolation is contrary to the truth concerning the oneness of the Body; because each local church is part of the Body universally, no church should be isolated from others&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-13, 27; Eph. 4:4.</li>
		<li>Because the Body is receiving a continual transfusion, to be isolated is to be cut off both from the transfusion and from the circulation of life in the Body; such a thing violates the law of the Body&mdash;1:22-23; 1 Cor. 10:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is the goal of God&rsquo;s economy, and the local churches are the procedure that God takes to accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 18:17; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; 1:2; Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1, 3-5, 16b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be in the local churches so that we can be ushered into the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-13, 27.</li>
		<li>We should pay more attention to the Body of Christ than to the local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 4:4, 12, 16.</li>
		<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are building up the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4-5, 12; 12:27; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>For the building up of the Body of Christ, there should be as much blending of all the local churches as practicality allows, without boundaries of states or nations&mdash;1 Cor. 12:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus has an urgent need for the Body to be expressed in the local churches; unless there is a substantial expression of the Body of Christ on earth, the Lord Jesus will not return&mdash;Matt. 16:18, 27; Eph. 5:23, 27; Rev. 19:7.</li>

<h1 class="title">Discerning the Destroyers of the Divine Building<br />
to Remain in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
of the Divine Building</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:12-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We need to see God&rsquo;s intention, Satan&rsquo;s strategy, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to dispense Christ with all His riches into His believers chosen by God for the constitution and building up of the Body of Christ, the church, to consummate the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s ultimate building for the full expression of the processed Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:8-10.</li>
	<li>Satan&rsquo;s strategy to destroy the divine building is versus the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of the divine building:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s strategy is to produce many substitutes for Christ; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of Christ as our center, reality, life, and everything&mdash;1 Cor. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18b; Rev. 2:4, 7, 17; 3:20.</li>
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s strategy is to divide the Body of Christ; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10-13; John 17:11b, 21; Eph. 4:3-4a; Rev. 1:11.</li>
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s strategy is to kill the function of all the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body by the clergy-laity system; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of the function of all the members of the Body of Christ&mdash;2:6; Eph. 4:15-16; 1 Cor. 14:4b, 26, 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must discern the destroyers of the divine building, the workers of lawlessness, who are usurped by Satan in his strategy against the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of Christ as everything for the building up of His Body through the functioning of all His members&mdash;Phil. 1:9; 2 Cor. 11:14-15; Matt. 7:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To destroy God&rsquo;s building is to ruin, corrupt, defile, and mar the temple of God; it is to build with the worthless materials of wood (the natural man), grass (the flesh), and stubble (lifelessness)&mdash;1 Cor. 3:17, 12b.</li>
	<li>Using any doctrine that differs from the fundamental teachings of the apostles (Acts 2:42) or any ways and efforts that contradict God&rsquo;s nature, Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work is to corrupt, ruin, defile, and mar the temple of God, that is, to destroy it.</li>
	<li>When the Lord Jesus comes back, our building work will be tested by His holy fire; if our work is done in Christ, with Christ, for Christ, and is even Christ Himself, it will pass the test of fire&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who blow the wind of divisive teachings by stressing things other than the central teaching concerning God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 4:14; 1 Tim. 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Teaching different things rather than the unique ministry of God&rsquo;s economy tears down God&rsquo;s building and annuls God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;vv. 3-4.</li>
	<li>There is only one ministry that ever builds up and never destroys&mdash;this is God&rsquo;s economy; the only way that we can be preserved in the eternal oneness is to teach the same thing in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12; 2 Cor. 4:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who preach and teach heresies&mdash;2 Pet. 2:1; 2 John 7-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Those who teach heresies concerning the person of Christ are antichrists, denying both the person of the Lord as the Master and His redemption, by which the Lord purchased the believers; to deny that the man Jesus is God is a great heresy&mdash;v. 7; 1 John 2:18, 22-23; 4:2-3.</li>
	<li>The apostle warned the believers to watch for themselves lest they be influenced by the heresies and lose the things of the truth; we must reject those who deny the conception and deity of Christ, not receiving them into our house nor greeting them&mdash;2 John 8-11.</li>
	<li>If we would not be led astray by the heresies but would abide faithfully in the truth concerning the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ, who is both God and man, both our Creator and our Redeemer, we will enjoy in Him the Triune God to the fullest extent as our full reward, even today on earth&mdash;v. 8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who are factious, sectarian&mdash;Titus 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions; in order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person should be refused, rejected, after a first and second admonition.</li>
	<li>Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church&rsquo;s profit that contact with the divisive one may be stopped&mdash;cf. Num. 6:6-7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who make divisions&mdash;Rom. 16:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Romans 14 Paul was liberal and gracious regarding the receiving of those who differ in doctrine or practice; however, in Romans 16:17 he was unyielding and resolute in saying that we must &ldquo;mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The Lord hates &ldquo;one who injects discord among brothers&rdquo;&mdash;Prov. 6:16, 19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who are ambitious for position&mdash;3 John 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The self-exalting and domineering Diotrophes is an evil pattern of someone who is ambitious for position and &ldquo;loves to be first&rdquo; among the saints&mdash;v. 9.</li>
	<li>We should never hunt to be the first in any work for the Lord; this is the insidious work of hidden ambition to compete with others to be the first.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The destroyers of the divine building are those who are wolves, not sparing the flock, and those who speak perverted things to draw away the believers after them&mdash;Acts 20:29-30:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The intrinsic need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for a remnant of His people to build up the church as the kingdom of God, to &ldquo;build up the wall,&rdquo; to protect the church from the destroyers of God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Neh. 2:4, 10, 17-20.</li>
	<li>We must shepherd the flock of God by declaring to them all the counsel of God, all of God&rsquo;s economy; under the Lord&rsquo;s shepherding, all the evil persons who disturb God&rsquo;s people are kept away from them so that they can dwell in peace and safety to be mingled with God and bound together in oneness&mdash;Acts 20:26-35; Ezek. 33:1-11; 34:25; cf. Zech. 2:8; 11:7.</li>

<li>Second Samuel 7:12-14a is a prophecy in typology revealing that the desire of God&rsquo;s heart is the building of God into man (God becoming man) and the building of man into God (man becoming God) for the building of a great corporate God-man, the New Jerusalem:

	<li>Christ &ldquo;came out of the seed of David according to the flesh&rdquo; (building God into man in incarnation), and He &ldquo;was designated the Son of God&rdquo; (building man into God) in resurrection&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By His incarnation Christ, the only begotten Son of God in His divinity (John 1:18), built God into man, into David&rsquo;s lineage, to become the seed of David, the son of David.</li>
		<li>In resurrection Christ&rsquo;s humanity was deified, sonized, meaning that He became the Son of God not only in His divinity but also in His humanity; in resurrection He was designated the Son of God, made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
		<li>If a seed dies by being buried in the soil, it will eventually sprout, grow, and blossom in resurrection, because the operation of the seed&rsquo;s life is activated simultaneously with its death; in resurrection Christ &ldquo;blossomed&rdquo; as the firstborn Son of God, and He became the life-giving Spirit to dispense, to build, Himself as life into our being to be our inner constitution&mdash;John 12:23-24; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 3:18.</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>As seeds of humanity, we are becoming sons of God with divinity, being &ldquo;divinized&rdquo; in our humanity through the metabolic process of transformation; this metabolic process is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God by the building of God into man and of man into God, consummating in the New Jerusalem as a great corporate God-man, the aggregate, the totality, of all the sons of God&mdash;Heb. 2:10; Rev. 21:7; Rom. 8:28-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life of the Son of God has been implanted into our spirit; now we, like the seed that is sown into the earth, must pass through the process of death and resurrection&mdash;v. 10; John 12:24-26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Losing our soul-life through death causes the outer man to be consumed, but it enables the inner life to grow, to develop, and ultimately, to blossom; this is resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31, 36; 2 Cor. 4:10-12, 16.</li>
		<li>The more we grow in life for our transformation in life, the more we are designated the sons of God to be deified for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to grow, we need to feed on the guileless milk and the solid food of the word&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:12-14.</li>
			<li>In order to grow, we need the watering of the gifted members&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6b; John 7:37-39; Prov. 11:25.</li>
			<li>Through all the things in our environment and by our failures, our ugly self is torn down, and the Lord has a greater opportunity to work within us&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
			<li>One day this process will be completed, and for eternity we will be the same as Christ, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, in our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;1 John 3:2; Rom. 8:19, 23; <em>Hymns,</em> #948, stanza 2.</li>

	<li>In resurrection Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God, and by means of such a resurrection we also are in the process of being designated sons of God&mdash;Rom. 8:11; cf. Hosea 6:1-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The process of our being designated, sonized, deified, is the process of resurrection with four main aspects&mdash;sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification&mdash;Rom. 6:22; 12:2; 8:29-30.</li>
		<li>The key to the process of designation is resurrection, which is the indwelling Christ as the rising-up Spirit, the designating Spirit, the power of life in our spirit&mdash;John 11:25; Rom. 8:10-11; Acts 2:24; 1 Cor. 15:26; 5:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We urgently need to learn how to walk according to the spirit, to enjoy and experience the designating Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 14.</li>
			<li>The more we touch the Spirit, the more we are sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified to become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:12; 8:15-16; Gal. 4:6.</li>
			</ol></li>

<li>As we work for God today, we should participate in God&rsquo;s building&mdash;the constitution of the divine element into the human element and of the human element into the divine element&mdash;John 14:20; 15:4a; 1 John 4:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need God in Christ to build Himself into us, making our heart, our intrinsic constitution, His home&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>
	<li>We need to practice one thing&mdash;to minister the processed and consummated Triune God into others so that He may build Himself into their inner man; we need to pray that the Lord will teach us to work in this way&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Cor. 3:9a, 10, 12a.</li>
	<li>When we build the church with the processed and consummated Triune God, it is not actually we who are building; rather, God is building through us, using us as a means to dispense and transmit Himself into others&mdash;Acts 9:15.</li>
	<li>This building will consummate in the New Jerusalem for eternity, in which God&rsquo;s redeemed are the tabernacle for God to dwell in and God Himself is the temple for His redeemed to dwell in&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
