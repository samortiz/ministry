First Kings 3:4 says, "And the king [Solomon] went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar." On the night after the offering, Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream. He prayed for wisdom, and the Lord granted his request; He even gave him what he did not ask for. When he woke from his dream, what did he immediately do? "And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants" (v. 15). Read  again this account in 2 Chronicles 1:3-4: "So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness. But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem." At that time, the tabernacle was in Gibeon, but the ark was not there anymore. While the tabernacle was in Gibeon, the ark was in Jerusalem. Therefore, after Solomon received wisdom, the first thing he did was to return to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices before the ark. He no longer offered sacrifices in Gibeon. This was a great turn in Solomon. Outwardly speaking, the tabernacle, the altar, the laver, the lampstand, the table with the showbread, and the golden incense altar were at Shiloh. But the ark was not there. (The tabernacle in Gibeon was the same tabernacle that was in Shiloh, because 2 Chronicles 1:3 clearly says that the tabernacle in Gibeon "was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.") Man thinks that it does not mean much to be without the ark. Yet the ark represents the presence of God, and without His presence, His heart cannot be satisfied even if everything else is good. Neither will our hearts be satisfied. Before Solomon received the Lord's revelation, he did not realize the importance of the ark. But after he received the Lord's revelation, he was enlightened and realized that the Lord's presence was more precious that anything else, and he returned to Jerusalem and offered sacrifices before the ark of the Lord. In Gibeon he only offered burnt offerings, but in Jerusalem he offered both burnt offerings and peace offerings and prepared a feast for all his servants. True worship is a worship that is before the Lord. True fellowship is a fellowship that is before the Lord, and true joy is a joy that is before the Lord. This was Solomon's experience; it is also the experience of many who know the Lord. O ark, precious ark! Those who know You will seek after You and will worship before You. When Solomon finished building the temple, he placed the ark in the temple, and the ark became the center once again in the temple (2 Chron. 5:1-9).</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>We have seen much of the history of the ark. The purpose for this study is to find out the relationship between Christ and the church. We have seen that the ark represents Christ. When the ark crossed the Jordan, it typified the Lord's death and resurrection. After His death and resurrection, we began to preach Christ, telling men that the veil has been rent and that Christ has opened a new and living way to God for us. We also tell people that He was the despised One, the One typified by the porpoise skin, yet He is now the One with whom God is pleased. He comes forth from God, as typified by the cloth all of blue. We are here to preach a Christ who was despised, who was exalted by God, and who is now glorified before God.</p><p>At its beginning, the church indeed preached a heavenly Christ. But even before the age of the apostles was over, changes had crept in. At the time of Paul, some had risen up to preach "a different gospel" (Gal. 1:6). Peter also warned that we should beware of "destructive heresies" (2 Pet. 2:1). John told us that we have to be aware of "the deceiver and the antichrist" (2 John 7). This shows us that there was an adulterating of the Lord's word even at that time. When Constantine rose up, he made Christianity the state religion and made the bishop of Rome the head of the whole church. Originally, the name of Christ was found inside the church only. At this time, it was found outside the church. The ark which was in Shiloh was now in the land of the Philistines. Once God's ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh, it never went back again. Jeremiah 26:6 says, "Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth." In other words, although the tabernacle was still in Shiloh, God's ark was gone; His rejection of the tabernacle in Shiloh became certain.</p><p>God's children are truly in need of a revelation. They need the revelation of Solomon! God appeared to Solomon and opened his eyes. He gave Solomon a great turn and showed him the preciousness of the ark and the vanity of a tabernacle without the ark. Brothers and sisters, are we for God's ark, or are we for a tabernacle that is void of the ark? Will we choose Christ, or will we choose a Christless religious form? We must consider whether our emphasis and center is Christ or whether we are maintaining a tabernacle in Shiloh which is void of the ark. Man considers the tabernacle in Shiloh precious; they grasp firmly to it. They think that since it was once the house of God, it will always be the house of God. But they are wrong. Jeremiah 7:4 says, "Do not trust in the words of falsehood that say, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, these buildings are the temple of Jehovah." God rebuked the Israelites because they cared for nothing except vain words, saying, "This is the temple of Jehovah," three times. Little did they realize that the temple became the temple of Jehovah because God was the center of the temple. Once God left the temple, the temple became nothing but an ordinary building. Brothers and sisters, the thing we have to treasure is the ark and not the tabernacle because the center of the tabernacle is the ark. The question now is: Is Christ the center, or are we holding onto the tabernacle as an empty shell? Brothers and sisters, if our heart is for Christ, we must look for the place where Christ is the center. We should be at the place where the name of Christ is found. Brothers and sisters, is Christ the center in the place where you are? If He is, we thank and praise the Lord! If He is not, may the Lord open our eyes, and may He turn us back to Jerusalem like Solomon, after he received the revelation to worship before the ark. May the Lord cause us to realize the vanity of our zealous service of the past, and may He bring us into the joy and peace before the ark, so that we can offer genuine service and worship to Him. Brothers and sisters, I earnestly pray that the Lord grants you a revelation of His preciousness, so that you make Him your excellent treasure and your center, offering up the burnt offering to Him, living for Him, and satisfying His heart!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
