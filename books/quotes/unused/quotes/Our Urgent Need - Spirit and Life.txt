Finally, we should always come together with the saints to worship, to fellowship, and to speak Christ and minister Christ to others
What we are will be expressed, and this will quench the thirst of today's society and meet the need of people today
All of the saints are lovable, and no one is worthy of being criticized, so we do not need to spend time on the negative things
Within the fallen race of man there is always the question: 'Is this good or evil, right or wrong, yes or no'?
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, people always brought questions concerning good and evil, right and wrong, and yes and no to Him

Some may talk about whether to worship God in this way or in that way, by this means or by that means, or in this place or in that place
We may have neglected and forgotten that to worship God is altogether not according to the outward way, but is a matter in our spirit
We must realize that the very One whom we worship does not demand that we worship Him in a certain place or in a certain way
History tells us that the Samaritans had the Pentateuch and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament, as did the Jews

Whether you are fifteen or fifty years old, has there ever been anything you saw in others that you did not criticize?
Whenever we are going to condemn or criticize others, we should be reminded that we are not the One who is without sin
Even some of our children know how to criticize the speakers in a meeting, and they know how to criticize the elders
If we can get rid of the criticism in the church life, ninety percent of the deadening will be swallowed up by life
According to their theology they reckoned that if a man is born blind, there must have been someone who sinned
Jesus answered, 'Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him'

According to the revelation of the Scriptures, there is a divine principle set up by God as His design, as His economy
God created man according to His image with the intention that man could be His vessel to contain and express Him
If the tree of life did not have anything to do with us today, we would be altogether in a miserable situation
According to the entire book of Revelation, the paradise of God in 2:7 is the New Jerusalem , of which the church is a foretaste today
Even today we have the privilege of eating the tree of life and of 'drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry'
The Triune God put Himself into us to become our believing ability and also the very object in which we believe
It is all right for us to get excited in the meetings, but when we get too excited, we need to learn to control ourselves
Faith may be considered as the seed of life, and this nobler love may be considered as the fruit of the seed of life in its full development
The issue of faith as the seed of life growing within us to its full development is that God and we become one entity

To bear the fruit of persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth to contact and reach people
We need to bear not only the fruit of virtues as the beauties of the divine life but also the fruit of solid persons
You must be a person that lives by the divine power within you, walking by and with a Holy Person, the Holy Spirit
You must be a person living by Christ as your life and walking with the Holy Spirit as your companion to bear much fruit of virtues
When you speak Christ in the preaching of the gospel, the second category of fruit will be there, the fruit of persons
If you are a Christian that lives by Christ and walks with the Spirit, you will be full of virtues, full of beauties
We have to be persons bearing the fruit of the Christian virtues, which are the very expression of the divine attributes
We will bear not only the fruit of the attributes of God as our virtues but also the fruit of saved, solid persons added to our virtues
