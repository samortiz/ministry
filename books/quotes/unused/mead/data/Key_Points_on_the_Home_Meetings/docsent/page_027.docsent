   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUCCESS OF THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DEPENDING ON THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For years I have been closely watching what others have been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within the last fifteen years the Lord has done many works apart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Seoul, South Korea, a so-called church increased in number from a few thousand to about five hundred thousand in two decades.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Indonesia, a Christian group doubled from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand in three years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Singapore the percentage of Christians in the total population is about ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One group among them meets in only a rented auditorium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet every Sunday they have eight sessions, each with eight hundred in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, six years ago a twenty-three year old missionary began working in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their number increased from four thousand to four sessions of over two thousand each.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am giving you all these examples to show you that within the last fifteen years the Lord has moved on tremendously all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Manila the same things are happening.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have lived in the United States for twenty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have often traveled from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the real situation everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The young people in the West now, especially the university students, are very receptive to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They want the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everywhere the Lord is moving quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have studied very much to find the reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these places that are increasing at a phenomenal rate have one thing in common: they are all practicing the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we began our work in Taiwan, the number reached such a peak because we practiced the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, we dropped the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, the Lord s move among us in the past twenty years has been comparatively slow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the years, the saints have developed a habit of listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the people just gather in the twenty-one meeting halls on Sunday to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Last year when I came back I made a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this does not mean that I am abandoning the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have said before that the big meetings and the home meetings are like two wings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord, on the whole the brothers and sisters responded quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But forgive me for saying that the Chinese disposition is very deliberate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In everything they wait and watch.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That being the case, I could only hold back my words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But tonight I am taking the opportunity to express to you some of my frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I called this urgent meeting because I want all of you to see the way the Lord is taking, and to respond to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PRACTICING ONE-ON-ONE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND MAKING HOME DELIVERIES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now that we have been practicing the home meetings for a year, I am encouraged because I have seen some progress in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A few days ago I went to a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the time came to start the meeting, no one showed up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I had to help set up the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the chairs were all set, still no one showed up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not say anything, but within myself I was quite agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Gradually, I became encouraged because the people began to come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were all out of breath because they had gone out to bring people to the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During the meeting a sister prayed so well that her expression, wording, and tone were just like music.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I asked around, I found out that she had been saved for less than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This reminded me not to judge by outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I can see that the saints here either do not make a move at all, or if they do, they make a move that surprises me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the churches in Taiwan there are two excellent imports: one is the brothers houses and the other is the one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The night before last, I attended the prayer meeting here in Hall One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the meeting I talked with the saints and found out that there are six full-time sisters and two full-time brothers here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I asked where they all lived.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One told me that he stays in the Cheng Kung High School brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another said she stays in the First Girls High School sisters house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I asked how many brothers and sisters houses there are.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They told me that there are seven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then I asked how many stay in each house, and they answered that the average is ten.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After I heard this, I realized that this is quite a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers houses were invented in America twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I strongly recommend them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are very useful in perfecting the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The second imported item is the one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means to speak the word of the Lord on a one-to-one basis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way, others receive the supply, and we ourselves are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Formerly our meetings were like restaurants.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But these restaurants were only open for half an hour each week during the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you did not come at that time, you would remain hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But now, if you cannot come to the home meeting, I will deliver the food to your home.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is all right if you cannot make the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I will deliver the food to your house.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I will feed you at a time convenient to you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through the home meetings, the brothers and sisters will all receive nourishment from the Lord s word, and the word of the Lord will spread everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the past we centered too much on the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A home meeting may have eight people who attend a particular meeting, but there may be over a dozen who do not attend.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every one of the eight brothers and sisters who attended the meeting should pick up the burden to visit the other twelve one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They should bring to them the riches of the home meeting and supply them at their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this way not only will the one who is visited be fed, but also those with him at his home will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can also sell the one-on-one to those saints who have a heart to serve, telling them how much we enjoy practicing the one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The key is to render some supply every week to specific people, using definite materials, and at a definite time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Remember, one-on-one does not mean that others meet you at the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It means that you go to visit them at their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to make home deliveries for them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Twenty years ago I saw people riding on bicycles with signboards saying, Injections given at your home.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The patients did not need to go to the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Instead, these people would come to the patients homes to give them the injections.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They would come in the morning or in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They would give the injections to the patients while they chatted with them for a minute or two.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the way we should practice our one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should minister Christ by going right into peoples homes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before we go, it is best if we first practice our speaking with our wife or husband at home.</S>
