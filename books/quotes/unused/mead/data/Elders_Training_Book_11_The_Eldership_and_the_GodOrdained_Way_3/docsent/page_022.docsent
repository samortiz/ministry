   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we know that someone has done something improper, we should not touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must have a strong burden to touch the person, but not his sin or failure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To know others' failures is a strong temptation and a strong spoiling of our contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not know someone's sins and failures, they may be helped by us when we touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, once we know of someone's failures, this knowledge changes our contact with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to know the defeated background of a brother without being changed in our attitude toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must contact such a brother as if we knew nothing about him and in a way full of life and full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By one hour of this kind of contact, he will receive something which will enlighten him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then he may go home to repent to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the way to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are the light of the world Matt 5:14 and the children of light Eph 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever we contact people, we should be a light shining over them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People must come to us to be under our enlightening, not our condemning or rebuking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When an elder first comes to a church, he may think that the church is very good and that there are many things for him to do in that church and many people to help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, however, he may come to know the backgrounds of everyone in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he may feel that he is jobless because there is no one good enough to help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why sometimes it is not good for certain elders to stay too long in a certain church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some elders eventually become an "information desk," knowing many things about everyone in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is very good if an elder can be in a city for fifteen years and seemingly know nothing about anyone except how to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowing too much about people may be illustrated by married life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the initial years of our marriage, we did not know much about our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we loved our spouse blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every lover is a blind person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love blinds people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, when our eyes "gain their sight," our love diminishes, and when we know everything about our spouse, our love is spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be marvelous if the elders could love everyone in the church life as much as they loved them in the first year they became an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I hear an elder complain about the brothers or sisters, this is an indication that he is finished as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has lost his ground to help anyone in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the "blind" elders are the real helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we first came to the church life, we did not know anything about the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, we were pleasant to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gradually, however, we came to know certain ones, and eventually we could not be pleasant to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our eldership has been robbed by our knowledge of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning of our church life, we had a "honeymoon," but after a few years, certain saints may have even become our adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because we know each other too well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the hardest part of being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are many lessons to learn in this regard.</S>
