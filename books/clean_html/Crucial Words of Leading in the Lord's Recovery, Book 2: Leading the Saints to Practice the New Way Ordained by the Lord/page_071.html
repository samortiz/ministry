<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: After the full-time trainees finish the training, should they stay in Taipei or go back to their sending localities to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Responsible brothers who originally served in other localities have come to Taipei to be trained for two years. During this period of time they obviously could not serve in their sending localities. From this standpoint, the churches in those localities have suffered some loss. At the same time they must hope that what these brothers have learned faithfully and properly in the training will be repaid in their localities after their return. Many big companies and hospitals have this practice; that is, they send employees to other places to learn through the exchange of experience. In this period of time the quality of medical care at the hospital may not be as good as before, or the quality of production in the factory may suffer, but these companies are willing to suffer this loss with the hope that those who are sent will learn higher skills and increase the production when they return. In this way what is initially lost will be compensated for later.</p>
<p>In fact, last summer we already considered whether we would let the brothers and sisters return to serve in their respective localities to compensate for the loss. At that time, however, tens of thousands of people had been gained through door-knocking in Taipei and were entrusted not only to the local saints but also to those who came for the training and had obtained permission from their sending localities to stay in Taipei to take care of the new ones. As a result, all the churches suffered loss; no one can deny this. Therefore, after studying this matter thoroughly, we hope that these trainees will return to their localities after the training. This is not only for the benefit of the sending localities, but I believe that it is profitable for all.</p>
<p>In our labor we not only need people, but we also need to use them properly. If everyone stays in Taipei but cannot be used properly, it is better for them to return to their sending localities. When they return to their sending localities to serve and coordinate in the church, they will surely be more profitable to the churches. This matter deserves our consideration.</p>
<p><em>Question: Three brothers bear responsibility in our locality, but since two went to Taipei for the training, only one remains. Can one or two brothers fill up this gap?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Of course, we first need to consider if there already is a suitable person who can fill the gap. Being an elder is a relative matter, not an absolute matter. For example, being a husband is also a relative matter. Some husbands sweep streets, and some are presidents. If every man was required to be a &ldquo;president&rdquo; in order to be qualified to be a husband, only one person in the whole country would be qualified to be a husband. This is the same in regard to the elders. Whether an elder is suitable depends upon those with whom he is matched; thus, it is a relative matter.</p>
<p>If we want to make a small table to hold a teacup, and we cannot find good material like teakwood, we may use softwood, and if we cannot find softwood, it is sufficient to use inferior wood. We simply need a small table so that when we drink tea, there is a place for us to put the cup. If we insist upon our consideration of materials and are unable to produce a small table, we have missed the point. It is the same in regard to our work for the Lord; we need to learn to use the materials that are available. This applies not only to our leading in the work but also to the brothers in all the churches in regard to arrangements and appointments. The churches are these brothers&rsquo; household, so they should fellowship and come up with an idea. For instance, when we encounter a situation in which two of the three responsible brothers temporarily leave to attend the training, we should carefully consider if we can use any of the available brothers. This matter depends upon our management, and it is our responsibility.</p>
<p><em>Question: If we need to appoint elders in the church, when is an appropriate time?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is the apostles who appoint elders. A church may need two elders; thus, if the leading ones find two brothers who are fitting, they should motivate them a little. If the brothers have not grown &ldquo;tall&rdquo; enough, the leading ones should try to help them mature. This matter depends upon the motivation of the brothers in a locality. If their feeling is not to appoint elders but to temporarily ask some to function in the office without giving them a title, this also depends on the actual situation. We do not have a set law; our only consideration is to serve the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the churches well.</p>
<p><em>Question: Could you explain the function of the apostles?</em></p>
<p>Answer: According to the Bible, first, apostles should be able to preach the gospel, to preach the person and ministry of the Lord Jesus in its entirety, that is, thoroughly according to God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s economy. Second, the apostles should be able to establish churches. Some saints are able to save people through gospel preaching, but they are not able to establish churches. The apostles must be able to establish churches; to establish churches is not a simple matter. Third, the apostles must know the apostles&rsquo; teaching, just as a lawyer must know the nation&rsquo;s constitution and all of its laws. When there is a problem in the church life, he must be able to solve the problem based on the apostles&rsquo; teaching in the New Testament. If a person is not able to do this, his qualification for apostleship is questionable; at most, he will be a very weak apostle.</p>
<p>For example, it is not acceptable for a lawyer to know the law only to a limited extent. He must know it thoroughly. Knowing the law thoroughly is even more important for justices because they judge matters related to the law. Their qualification is based on their thorough knowledge of the law. Similarly, in fulfilling his ministry, an apostle must be constituted with the apostles&rsquo; teaching and thoroughly know the truth. If there is any shortcoming in his knowledge of the truth, he will not be able to make proper judgments, and his judgment will not be accurate. This does not necessarily mean that he is not an apostle, but he is certainly not strong enough. Hence, in principle an apostle should be able to do three things: preach the complete gospel, establish local churches, and truly understand the apostles&rsquo; teaching. In Acts 2 three thousand people were saved and all of them continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles (vv. 41-42). The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the fundamental truth in the New Testament.</p>
<p><em>Question: In our locality we have perfected a number of brothers and sisters who can be pillars. At this time, is it better for them to propagate in nearby towns and villages or stay in our locality? In some of the towns and villages, some older brothers have been meeting for quite a while, and they claim that a certain one is the responsible brother. How should we proceed in our further fellowship with them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should consider two factors in regard to whether we should ask saints to stay in our locality to labor or send them out to propagate. As far as manpower is concerned, we need to consider where it is more profitable to labor. If it is more profitable to labor in your locality, they should stay to labor there; if it is more profitable to labor elsewhere, then they should go elsewhere to labor. Like farmers, we should go where the rain is. In some places there may be a drought for a whole year; thus, there is no need for us to farm there. This is based upon a principle in Genesis 2:5; that is, no rain came because there was no man to work the ground. The growth of plants depended upon the principle that some needed to work the ground.</p>
<p>Based upon this principle some should be sent from our locality to the surrounding villages, but if there is not much fruit or growth because of the lack of rain, we should stop. A farmer knows that he needs to labor on the fields that grow and leave the fields that do not grow; once the rain comes and the land is watered, he will begin to plow another field. This is the direction we should follow.</p>
<p>When people begin to meet, sometimes elders are spontaneously produced. When we go to help them, we need to observe their situation accurately. Are the elders who have been produced spontaneously the proper ones? Are there other brothers with more experience than them? If this is the case, we will have to try our best to lead them so that the more experienced ones will rise up and bear the responsibility. This will lead to a greater and better result. However, this matter is difficult to carry out; hence, we must be very careful.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no set rule or dead regulation governing this matter; rather, it is based on the facts, the benefits, and the leading according to the actual environment. In a locality there may be two or three brothers who are already elders, yet there may be two or three with more experience; however, due to the situation of the church and the particular environment, a change may lead to something negative and produce a poor result; in this situation it is better not to make any change. Instead, simply go along with the situation and help them based upon the actual situation with the hope that one day God will perfect the elders and raise them up.</p>
