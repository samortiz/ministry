   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ELDERS REGARDING HERESY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point, I would like to ask a question of those who are elders in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose certain ones in the church begin to teach that the believers today should be circumcised and keep the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a proper way you should say, We ask you not to speak in the church meetings and not to spread this teaching among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are teaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you continue to spread this heresy, we will not allow you to remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To tell believers to be circumcised and to keep the law of Moses nullifies God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also nullifies the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It makes both Christ and His death of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is exactly what Paul says concerning such teaching in Galatians 2:21.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse Paul tells us that he does not nullify the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any who teach the heresy that believers must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses should be told to have a change in their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, the church cannot receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church can receive only those who believe in our Savior Jesus Christ, in His redeeming death, in His resurrection and ascension, and in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law of Moses is dispensationally over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 15:6 says, And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse mentions the apostles and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostles are universal, and the elders are local.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why were Paul and Barnabas sent from Antioch to Jerusalem, when the problem they were facing was in Antioch?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They went to Jerusalem because the source of the problem was there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say that the flow of the problem reached Antioch, but the source was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It would not have been right to deal with the flow without dealing with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if the flow had been dealt with, the source would still have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, they went to Jerusalem to deal with the source; they did not go there because the church in Antioch regarded the church in Jerusalem as the head church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>NO HIERARCHY BUT THE PRESIDING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, Paul and Barnabas did not regard Peter and James as high officials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If such had been the case, then a hierarchy would have been in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there was not any hierarchy, and Peter in particular was not a pope, as Catholicism falsely claims.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here in Acts 15 we have the unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both were the leading ones in the Lord s New Testament move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was no chairman.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This conference was under the presiding of the Spirit v. 28 , the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the church Col 1:18 and the Lord of all Acts 10:36 . Acts 15:7 says, Much discussion had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicated that everyone in the conference had the freedom to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The decision made was based on the testimony shared by Peter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>7-11 , the facts related by Barnabas and Paul v. 12 , and the concluding word given by James, who was the leading one among the apostles and elders in Jerusalem 12:7; 21:18; Gal 1:19; 2:9 because of the influence he exercised over the believers through his piety.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A RECORD OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some think that the conference in Acts 15 was the first church council.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a mistaken understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we do not have a council but a gathering for fellowship, with the Holy Spirit as the One presiding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, it was said, It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us... v. 28 . There was no voting, and there was neither autocracy nor democracy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Autocracy and democracy should not exist in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, in the church life there should simply be fellowship in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 15 is a record of this kind of fellowship.</S>
