   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLE STUDY MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers and sisters in Shanghai used to have a Bible study meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We studied the books of Romans, Ephesians, and 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unfortunately, this meeting has stopped for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of Bible study meeting is not for only one person to speak; it is for the brothers to study the Word together before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some brothers may open up a passage, while the other brothers may speak some, discuss some, ask questions, or supply explanations for that particular passage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way, verse by verse, a passage is covered, and the whole chapter is read and studied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unfortunately, because no brother was particularly willing to take up the responsibility of the Bible study meeting, it stopped after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I feel that in the places where there is an assembly, it is a failure if we do not have a Bible study meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is to be a Bible study meeting, the brothers should be trained in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sisters should also do the same thing in the sisters' meeting according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are no definite leaders in a Bible study meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers can read a passage, others can ask questions, while still others can answer or give interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle of this meeting is that nothing is done for one's own benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No brother should involve his personal feelings in the meetings; they should all be left outside the door before entering the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to take care of the expression of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is true not only for the Bible study meeting but for all meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the meetings are for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the meetings, we are not expressing ourselves, and we should not wait passively for others to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the meetings, we are here to serve our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord once said that the ones who are served are not great; rather, the ones who serve others are great.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time we come to the meeting, we have to remember that we are here to be a servant to the brothers and sisters; we are here to serve the brothers and sisters and not just to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time we come, we should consider ourselves as ones who serve and help the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not have the proud thought that by doing this, we are greater and better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do this because we ought to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in this kind of meeting we should not wait for others to open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps we should open our mouth first to ask questions and show the other brothers something and then leave time for others to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way, everyone will be able to go on along the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we realize that a question is adequately covered, we can go to another question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to remember that the purpose of these kinds of questions is not for taking care of ourselves or understanding something for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should strive to make sure that the other brothers receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, when we ask questions, we should not ask only questions that we want to ask and skip other questions that we already know the answers to.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we may know many answers already, the new brothers may not know them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we know the answers, we should ask on their behalf and express what they want to know in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The message meeting is for helping strong Christians, while the Bible study meeting is for helping weak believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the message meetings, only those who can receive the message receive help; those who cannot receive the message do not receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The message meeting can be considered as being mostly for the knowledgeable or intelligent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, knowledge or wisdom depends on God, not on man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are foolish, illiterate, slow, or dull can receive only forty to fifty percent of what is released in the message meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible study meeting is designed to help the weak believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible study meeting you will realize how much your brother understands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may think that some brothers ask unrelated or meaningless questions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may think that they are dull.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, this is exactly what they need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through their questions, you will learn what is affecting them or touching them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may be a small thing to you, but to them it may be something great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It may be an insignificant thing to you, but to them it may be as great as a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, do not think that the Bible study meeting is too shallow and of no help to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are there to help the meeting; you are there as a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the sisters, who do not open their mouths in the meeting, are there to help the meeting; they are there to serve the brothers and be the servants also.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps your absence will become a loss for others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If everyone skips these meetings, the meetings will become small in number, and it will be a loss to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For you to come is to agree with this meeting and support the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not know if you realize that it is wrong for us not to help or serve the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We care only for our own spiritual growth and do not want to help or serve the brothers; we do not care for the brothers' benefit or for the advancement of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sisters should not think that they do not need to come anymore because they do not open their mouths and since they already understand the things being covered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, their sitting in the meeting is a help to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moreover, if some brothers feel that they know and understand a certain subject, they can ask questions on behalf of others and answer on behalf of others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They should not think that they understand the subject, considering it to be repetitious because they have heard it several times.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope that the brothers and sisters learn to behave as brothers and sisters in the meetings and learn to behave as human beings among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that the brothers and sisters can have a common progress together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, I expect to resume the Bible study meeting among us within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the meeting, do not raise controversial questions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>During the past year, in all of our meetings, we have made progress and seen God's blessing in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But one day I saw a dreadful situation: two brothers were arguing about something to the extent that both were flushed with anger.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did not know how to behave as brothers among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The apostle said that we should not be involved with doubtful disputations.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you insist on arguing, you are doing wrong to your brother; you are not helping your brother but merely insisting on your own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you prevail in your own ideas yet have not rendered help to your brother, what good does that do?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, in any kind of meeting, all of our flesh must be restrained and all of our self must be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is easy to say this at other times, but our flesh encounters the greatest test in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At other times we may see the gentleness, love, and patience of a brother, but in the meetings we learn whether a brother is raw, sour, or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, in the meetings we should try our best to drop doubtful things and not argue about them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unfortunately, almost every brother thinks that his ideas should be accepted by others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The only principle in the Bible study meeting is to drop the self.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Being prideful or withdrawing in a meeting is an undesirable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Pride is looking at one's virtues; withdrawing is looking at one's own weakness and uselessness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a person appreciates his own virtues, he will open his mouth often.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If a person is conscious of his own weakness and uselessness, he will not open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Actually, it is equally bad to open one's mouth or close one's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Where there is self, there is pride; where there is self, there is withdrawal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Both of these are the flesh and should be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All questions should be for the Lord to receive the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As long as He has the glory, there should not be any problem.</S>
