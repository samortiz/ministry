Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</P><P>"The things that you are about to suffer." The Lord Jesus is here forewarning His people of their coming sufferings. The Lord Jesus is the prophet to His church; He knows everything that is going to happen. There is not one thing that He does not know. He is our watchman. Before any calamity comes, He warns us ahead of time and causes us to realize our position. If we want to serve the Lord faithfully, we will surely encounter sufferings and persecutions. The result of taking the way of the cross is termination at the cross. The cross that we believe in will eventually crucify us. To be the Lord's disciples, we have to relinquish everything. He who does not love the Lord more than he loves his parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and his own life is not worthy to be the Lord's disciple. Those who want to follow the Lord and to live in godliness cannot avoid persecutions. The Lord has not deceived us. He has not kept back His words before we became His disciples, and then left us to undergo unexpected sufferings afterwards. He told us already that there are sufferings which we are "about to suffer." He does not intend that we face the persecutions from the world unprepared. Rather, He told us that "in the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). In this way, those who want to build towers and engage in wars will know how to "sit down and calculate the cost," and to "sit down and deliberate" (Luke 14:28, 31).</P><P>The Lord not only forewarns us of sufferings in the pathway ahead, He also encourages us ahead of time, saying: "Do not fear." Fear is the characteristic of all feeble creatures. It is unavoidable for the flesh to tremble before coming suffering. The Lord's word is not intended to inform us of the sufferings and then lead us to fear. His forewarning is to save us from fear. The Lord knows our weaknesses; He also knows the root of our weaknesses. To remove fear is to remove failure. Fear is the first step to failure. Those who are afraid of suffering are mostly subdued by the enemy and are bound; they turn to the easy way in everything. It is indeed true that man's desires often become his snares, and man's fears cause him to withdraw. Satan's way is to cause man to run away out of fear, or to drop his standard out of fear of running away. Many times, by opening up to private dealings with the enemy, we avoid what is threatening us. But will those who faithfully love the Lord and who willingly serve Him do such a thing? The Lord has no intention for us to be careless, loose, and unwatchful as a result of overcoming the fear of suffering and persecution. Before trials come, many are self-confident and would boast of their boldness. But when persecution comes, they would fail. However, those who are careful and sober, who are apprehensive of the possibility of failure, are often the ones who secure full victory and who glorify the Lord's name. It is wrong to be fearful, but it is also important to be careful. Only those who are not self-confident will not fear. Otherwise, failure is certain. There is a distinction between fearlessness and carelessness or self-confidence.</P><P>"Do not fear." What is the reason that they should not fear? It is not that the tribulations are small. Actually, the tribulation of that day was greater than what the flesh can bear. Neither is it the promise of protection from tribulations. On the contrary, they were to pass through the tribulations completely. It is not that they have the power to withstand or that they could be faithful in the tribulations. If those were the reasons, they would be very untrustworthy indeed. In other places the Lord has told us: "In the world you have affliction, but take courage [be not afraid]; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). His victory is the basis of our victory. It is not that He is victorious and that we can therefore be victorious by ourselves. Rather, it is that He is victorious, and we are victorious in Him. Although He is the best pattern in the world, apart from Him we are powerless. We will suffer tribulations. However, we do not need to fear because of these tribulations, for the power of Christ is greater than that of Satan. We should declare with the apostles: "But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" (Rom. 8:37). Because we have Him, and for this reason only, we are not afraid. How precious is this "Him"!</P><P>"Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried" (Rev. 2:10). Not only do the Lord's flaming eyes see the future tribulations coming out of man's organizations, but they search into the activity of the demons in the air amidst these tribulations. The church in Smyrna would not only receive reviling and suffering from the hand of man, but would suffer greater persecutions. The devil would cast some of them into prison. Here we see the Lord revealing to us the true condition behind everything. He wants us to know that the one who persecutes, hurts, and kills us is not the Roman emperor, officers, or soldiers, but the devil. The Lord Jesus wants us to identify clearly who our enemy really is, who is the one that is really hurting us, and who is the real source of all sufferings. It is very easy for us to look at man and to hate man. But the Lord wants us to know the creator of all sufferings. Humanly speaking, it was Peter who tried to stop the Lord Jesus from going to the cross. But the Lord Jesus did not see Peter. Rather, He saw Satan. Humanly speaking, the woman who was bent double was sick of a physical illness. However, the Lord considered it as a bondage of Satan. Many things appear to be works of man and are natural in the human eyes. But the Lord Jesus discerns Satan and works behind the human factors and the natural phenomena. The Lord Jesus' eyes see through man and all the natural phenomena. Man considers the persecution in the church in Smyrna as coming from Rome. Yet the Lord Jesus considered the persecutors to be not Rome, nor any other men, but Satan. The devil is the instigator of all oppositions against Christ and the Christians.</P><P>This should be a lesson for us. We should clearly identify our enemy. Many times, we have forgotten that Satan even exists! Because we do not have the experience of the ascended life, often we fail to have discerning eyes to watch over the devil and his works. Many times, we consider things that happen as natural occurrences. Actually, behind everything, there are the supernatural powers interfering! The first step of Satan's work is to hide himself. He allows man to see only the serpent in the garden of Eden, without seeing the actual person behind. We often consider that our persecutors are men, or that misunderstandings are from our brothers, that rejection is from our friends, and that sufferings are from our folks. We do not see the instigating Satan behind these people. If we really know the works of Satan, we will not blame others, but will hate Satan all the more. In this way, it will become easy for us to forgive others. If believers would be on the alert, understand the enemy's tricks in division and mistrust, and oppose him in oneness, removing all barriers, there would not be so much argument among them. Concerning this matter, we can only say this much. Let us come back to our subject.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
