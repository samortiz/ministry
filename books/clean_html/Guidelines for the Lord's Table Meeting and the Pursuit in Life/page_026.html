CONCERNING THE PURSUIT OF LIFE</h1>
<p>Concerning the pursuit of spiritual life, we should not take the easy way. As we are dealing with life, which is something living, we should avoid any dead condition. We should not focus merely on the principle of life; rather, we should focus on the genuine pursuit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;HANDING OURSELVES OVER&rdquo; NOT RELATED<br />
TO BEING STRONG OR WEAK<br />
BUT TO GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL INTENTION</h2>
<p><em>Question: How much of our need to &ldquo;hand ourselves over&rdquo; is related to our condition?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Since we have not had sufficient fellowship concerning this matter, many saints think that they need to hand themselves over because they are defeated. They seem to think that if they had not failed, that is, if they were all right, they would not need to hand themselves over. However, this is not the case. As far as God&rsquo;s original intention is concerned, we must still hand ourselves over no matter what our condition is, even if it is the best. Handing ourselves over has nothing to do with our condition. This relates to the fact that even apart from our sins the Lord needed to go to the cross and die for us in order to release the divine life. In God&rsquo;s eyes, even if we are strong and victorious, we need to hand ourselves over to Him for the divine life to be wrought and constituted into our being.</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, even if others consider our condition to be excellent, in the eyes of God we are still living out ourselves rather than the life of God. This is not what God wants. God&rsquo;s intention is not to save and help us by His life because we are weak and our condition is poor. His original purpose in His plan is to work His life into us; this has nothing to do with whether we are weak or strong. When we are weak, He works His life into us; when we are strong, He still works His life into us. This is what He does whether we are weak or strong.</p>
<p>God needs our cooperation in order to work His life into us. However, His life being worked into us is not for making up a lack on our part. God&rsquo;s intention is to work His life into us so that His Son may be the Firstborn among many brothers for the expression of the glory of His Son. Since the light we have seen is inadequate, low, and shallow, we always think that we need the strong life of God to help us because we are weak. Actually, man needed God&rsquo;s life when he was still in the garden of Eden, long before our father Adam fell. This is typified by Adam&rsquo;s being placed in front of the tree of life after he was created. Even though Adam had not yet fallen and was not yet weak, he was placed in front of the tree of life in order to receive God as life.</p>
<p>Hence, we must hand ourselves over to God to let Him have the proper opportunity to work Himself into us so that His original purpose may be fulfilled in us. This is not related to being weak or strong; this is a matter concerning the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH OF THE CROSS<br />
DEPENDING ON OUR SEEING LIGHT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Subjectively speaking, do we experience the Lord&rsquo;s death once and for all?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Anyone with such a thought does not have much light. People analyze whether their experience of the cross is subjective or objective because they lack adequate light regarding the cross. They do not see that all things have been crucified with Christ, not just the old man and the flesh.</p>
<p>For a period of time there were two factors that caused me to be afraid of the Japanese; one factor was specific and the other was general. The general factor was that I had a bad impression of the Japanese; to my impression they were terrible. The specific factor was my being put in prison as a result of false charges brought against me by Japanese who were envious of the fact that the Lord was blessing my work in northern China. Even though I was released from prison because of a serious illness, I was still kept under surveillance. When I was released, the Japanese were in control, and Tsingtao was under their occupation. When I saw what the Japanese had done in Tsingtao, I was very depressed. One evening in 1945 a brother heard over the radio that the Japanese emperor would announce an unconditional surrender on August 14. I have not been afraid of the Japanese from the day I heard this news. Formerly, I feared the sight of a Japanese military officer. However, after hearing of their imminent surrender, I would not have been frightened even if they pointed a gun at me. This is to see a great light.</p>
<p>In the same principle, when the Lord opens our eyes to see that Satan has been defeated on the cross and that the cross has terminated all things, including us, then all that we are and have will be terminated. For three days, from August 13 through 15 of 1945, when Japan announced their surrender, some of us went everywhere, shouting, &ldquo;Japan has surrendered! Japan has surrendered!&rdquo; We were beside ourselves. We heard the announcement over the radio and read about it in the newspaper. It was not a matter of whether Japan&rsquo;s surrender was subjective or objective; it was a matter of seeing the fact that the problem between Japan and China was over.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that Satan, sin, the self, our old man, and all things have been terminated on the cross. There is nothing subjective or objective regarding this. We should not think that objectively we need to know that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord, and subjectively we need to experience the crucifixion of the Lord when we are losing our temper. If we think this way, we may think that though we know that our flesh has been crucified objectively, it is difficult for us to experience it subjectively. This would mean that we need someone beside us to daily and subjectively remind us not to lose our temper. Once the news of Japan&rsquo;s surrender was broadcast, I realized that the Japanese were finished. From that time on I was not afraid whenever I saw a Japanese. Likewise, we need to see daily that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord. Perhaps we would say that we do not feel anything. This can be compared to my experience with the Japanese. Originally, I did not know that Japan had surrendered, but after a brother came and told me of their surrender, I was beside myself for three days. We need light that we may have a genuine seeing.</p>
<p>We need to hand ourselves over to God whether we are victorious or defeated. God wants us to hand ourselves over, because His original plan is to work Himself into us. Even in the beginning, in the garden of Eden, the created Adam was not weak and had not fallen, yet God still wanted him to receive the tree of life. If we genuinely see this great principle, we will not care for minor points. From eternity God&rsquo;s plan has been to work His life into us in His Son. We need to see this. This has nothing to do with our falling, sinning, being weak, or being strong. This is what God will do whether we are good or bad.</p>
<p>When we see this, we will forget trivial matters. It is a great matter to see that our condition does not matter; such a seeing can solve our problems. This also applies to Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. We need to see that this all-inclusive death has been accomplished. On the cross, not only were we crucified, but the flesh, the self, and everything in the universe were dealt with by the cross. Death, Satan, and everything that was created was terminated on the cross. When Japan surrendered, all her people, including the emperor, great officials, and even small soldiers, were finished. As long as we see and receive Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death on the cross, our problems will be solved.</p>
