[1]  In recent years, God has raised up many brothers and sisters in various places.
[2]  As a result of seeing the truth concerning the church, they have gathered together to meet in the Lord s name.
[3]  They have left human organizations and things that are apart from the Bible, and they have come together to serve the Lord with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[4]  Although these scattered brothers who are meeting in the Lord s name have seen much concerning human organizations, they do not have, as yet, a deep enough understanding of the Body of Christ.
[5]  Although they have given up things that should not be in the church, they have not fully lived out the proper living of the Body of Christ.
[6]  This book is a record of a Bible study conducted by Brother Watchman Nee with the local brothers who were meeting in Shanghai after the Third Overcomer Conference in January of this year together with some out-of-town brothers who stayed behind after the conference .
[7]  God does not want His children to move freely on earth; He rules over His church through the authority He establishes in the church.
[8]  Brothers and sisters, although this meeting is in the nature of a Bible study, we cannot read all the scriptural references because of the limitation of time.
[9]  During the Saturday evening brothers meeting, we considered what we should study.
[10]  However, we know that the purpose of God from beginning to end is to have a corporate Christ, which is the church, so that Christ might be the Head and the believers might be the members.
[11]  If your eyes are open, you will see that all these things should be dropped and that you should turn your attention to the church, because the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, is the goal of God.
[12]  Therefore, we have decided to study the following subjects: the authority of the church, the fellowship of the church, the way to meet, the way to divide up our local assembly into one meeting on Wen-teh Lane and another meeting on Gordon Lane, and how the two are one.
[13]  In order to understand authority in the church, we must first understand what authority is.
[14]  Otherwise, we will not understand authority in the church.
[15]  God desires that man submit to authority because the authorities are not only appointed by God, but they also represent God.
[16]  God has appointed the elders and apostles to be the authority in the church.
[17]  In each respective church, God establishes elders; among all the churches, God establishes apostles.
[18]  The authority of apostles is for overseeing all the churches, while the authority of elders is for overseeing each respective local church.
[19]  In order to manifest His authority in the church, God appoints elders in each of the local churches to represent His authority.
[20]  In the Bible, there are clear guidelines concerning the qualifications of the elders.
[21]  They must have much assurance concerning God s truth and must be able to teach it.
[22]  Suppose that some of them purposely try to entice some of our brothers and sisters to join them in their Bible study in their homes, after breaking bread with us, or suppose that they gather some of the brothers and sisters who are meeting with us to listen to their opinionated doctrines.
[23]  But God tells the elders, Therefore the elders among you...shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock 1 Pet 5:1-3 .
[24]  Question: If we announce some unofficial elders among us, those in the denominations will say that we have become a denomination because we have brought in such a matter.
[25]  If we think this way, we are more evil than the most evil persons in the world, and we become worse than those who have not left the denominations, because those who have not left the denominations are still under man s authority even though they do not have the God-ordained authority.
[26]  Answer: Acts 20 clearly says that the Holy Spirit has placed men to be overseers over the flock.
[27]  If an elder is gifted and is so busy with the affairs of the church that he has no more time to take up an occupation, he should receive double honor from the brothers.
[28]  This is because 1 Corinthians 12 says that gifts are not appointed by men and are not obtained according to human will; they are distributed to all respectively even as He purposes v. 11 . Pastoring is a gift of the Holy Spirit and is given to the church by God through the Spirit.
[29]  Answer: No. Elders cannot be elected, because they are appointed by the apostles.
[30]  If someone asks if we are the church on Hardoon Road, you should say no. We should not admit that we are the church in Shanghai, because besides us there are the Shou-jin Chapel, the Mu-re Chapel, the Chin-lin Chapel, etc. There are many saved ones who are not meeting with us.
[31]  If others ask us what we are, we have to answer that we are not the church; we are not the church in Shanghai.
[32]  Question: Will God take back the gifts at times?
[33]  We can have three different attitudes toward God s gifts: 1 we can misuse them, like the Corinthians; 2 we can bury them, like the one in Matthew 25; and 3 God can stop the gifts.
[34]  The reason there are problems in all the local assemblies and in the church is that the brothers and sisters are not willing to accept the cross of Christ.
[35]  In the church there should not only be responsible ones like the elders, but the church should also have serving ones like the deacons.
[36]  The church needs men who give proposals and who manage and oversee the brothers, like the elders.
[37]  CHAPTER TWO THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP THERE BEING ONLY ONE CHURCH
[38]  The Bible says that there is only one church.
[39]  The church which Paul was in is the same church that we are in. The church that we are in is the same church that the apostle John, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and all regenerated persons are in. The church in the Bible is not separated by time, locality, or race.
[40]  There is only one church, which exists at all times and in all places.
[41]  Since Ephesians mentions one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God, why does the Bible mention churches also?
[42]  The Lord charges us to break the bread every Lord s Day in order to remind us that the churches in the various localities are not independent churches but are joined as one church.
[43]  Although you are a miniature church and a small community within a certain boundary, God intends that this miniature church, this small community, express the large-scale church, the large community.
[44]  If a brother has been received into the bread-breaking meeting, he is not received into the assembly in Hangchow, Tientsin, or Soo-chow but into the churches of God, the outward house of God.
[45]  When we receive a brother in Hangchow, we are receiving him on behalf of the churches in Tientsin, Shanghai, Soo-chow, and other places.
[46]  If we intend to receive a person in Shanghai and think that the brothers in Hangchow and Peking may not receive him, we should not receive him either.
[47]  If you know that the thing you are about to do in your locality will be considered inappropriate in other localities, you must not take care of the views of the few in your locality and do it anyway.
[48]  If what we do individually cannot represent the brothers in Shanghai, we should not do it.
[49]  If a brother wants to be received into the bread-breaking meeting, we must examine him carefully because we are receiving him not only on behalf of the brothers in Shanghai, but also on behalf of the brothers meeting in Tientsin, Hangchow, Wenchow, and other places.
[50]  The brothers in the other localities should believe what the brothers in Shanghai have done and receive him into the bread-breaking meeting based on the letter of recommendation.
[51]  In practice, we have to ask: What responsibility should the brothers bear?
[52]  Every brother should bear the responsibility not only of the local assembly but of the brothers and sisters who are in fellowship with them in the whole of China.
[53]  One of our shortages is that we who meet in Shanghai only see the ones meeting in Shanghai, while those meeting in Peking only see the ones meeting in Peking.
[54]  Therefore, every time we are about to receive a brother into our bread-breaking meeting, the responsible brothers should show him that the breaking of bread is for the discerning of the Body.
[55]  If in that place there are two or three places that one can have fellowship with such as the Brethren assemblies or other independent meetings , and if the choice is up to him, he should choose to fellowship with the brothers who have fellowship with us.
[56]  If anyone wants to set up an assembly in a place and does not want to fellowship or communicate with other assemblies, he is not standing on the ground of the church.
[57]  None of the churches in the Bible ignored the other churches.
[58]  In other countries, among all the so-called churches, we have not yet found an assembly that is standing on the same ground of the church as we are.
[59]  If there are such assemblies and we care only for the churches in China and refuse to communicate with these churches in foreign countries, we are wrong.
[60]  If we only care for the churches in China and cut off the churches in other countries, we are not walking according to God s will.
[61]  If the brothers in Chefoo adopt a closed attitude, work diligently, and ask the brothers to do everything according to the Bible, but do not fellowship with others, then sectarianism has to be dealt with all over again in Chefoo because they have become a sect.
[62]  Therefore, if we want to serve God properly, we must learn how to not disobey God s commands and how to be restricted by the brothers and sisters.
[63]  Question: Suppose a brother has a letter of recommendation from the church in Tsinan, and he comes to meet with the assembly in Shanghai.
[64]  Later, if he is excommunicated by the assembly in Shanghai, should the brothers in Tsinan be consulted before he is excommunicated?
[65]  Since the brothers in Tsinan are willing to recommend him, their decision must be right; we should believe in the words of the brothers in Tsinan absolutely and receive him initially.
[66]  But if later we deal with this person and excommunicate him, we do not have to inform the brothers in Tsinan.
[67]  When that person comes to the assembly in Shanghai with a letter of recommendation, he is received by the brothers in Shanghai and is treated like all other brothers in Shanghai.
[68]  Question: Some believers are critical of the truth we hold.
[69]  They cling tenaciously to their own Bible study, yet they want to break bread with us and even preach in our bread-breaking meeting.
[70]  How should we deal with this kind of people?
[71]  Answer: If there is an exclusive Bible study meeting, it is not being conducted according to the principle of the church.
[72]  In other words, it is not God s work but man s imitation of God s work.
[73]  Question: Sometimes I live in Shanghai and sometimes in Suchow.
[74]  When the brothers in Suchow want me to do something for them, they consider me a brother in Suchow.
[75]  Answer: Since you return to Suchow every year during the holidays and you feel that you should bear more responsibility for the meeting in Suchow, perhaps it is right for you to be considered as a brother in Suchow.
[76]  Since you are in Suchow often, the brothers in Shanghai cannot consult with you about things concerning the assembly in Shanghai.
[77]  If a person is saved and does not have any obvious sins that forbid him from partaking of the bread, yet he does not want to be responsible to the meeting or fellowship with the brothers, and instead wants to control us, what should we do?
[78]  When we gather together on the Lord s Day evening to break bread, we should realize not only that the ones who are breaking bread together are the Body of Christ, but that all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of the Lord are the Body of Christ.
[79]  Question: If that is the case, can a person who represents the church go to the sick brother and anoint him?
[80]  Answer: If you go to a new place and find an assembly in which baptism, the breaking of bread, the way of meeting, the place given to woman, and the appointment of elders and deacons are all done according to the Bible and which is the same as we are, you must not rashly join their table and their fellowship.
[81]  We are closed because we cannot go to others for fellowship or the breaking of bread, as long as they are not standing on the ground of the church, no matter how scriptural in form their meeting may be.
[82]  Does such an assembly recognize that the church of God is universal and that it has to fellowship with other local assemblies who are standing on the ground of the church?
[83]  If anyone thinks that he is not in a sect but does not want to cooperate in work and fellowship with others who are not in a sect but would rather act independently, he is not standing on the ground of the church even though he receives all of God s children.
[84]  If there are brothers who are not in a sect in one place who do not fellowship with those who are not in a sect in another place, they are the same as the denominations and not standing on the ground of the church.
[85]  There are several kinds of meetings, but we have to pay attention to two things with every meeting:
[86]  Those who live upstairs in the meeting hall should not wait until the first hymn is sung downstairs before they come down for the meeting.
[87]  Although we can learn to remember the Lord by following the leading of the Spirit and start the meeting for the remembrance of the Lord in different ways, sometimes with His suffering, sometimes with the forgiveness of sins, and sometimes with the Lord s glory, a person who is late to the meeting will not know how the meeting has begun, and his prayer and hymn selection will not be in line with the meeting.
[88]  After the breaking of bread, we see the Lord Jesus as the firstborn Son; we have a share in the Son of God and have become God s many sons.
[89]  The brothers and sisters in Shanghai used to have a Bible study meeting.
[90]  This kind of Bible study meeting is not for only one person to speak; it is for the brothers to study the Word together before God.
[91]  Some brothers may open up a passage, while the other brothers may speak some, discuss some, ask questions, or supply explanations for that particular passage.
[92]  I feel that in the places where there is an assembly, it is a failure if we do not have a Bible study meeting.
[93]  Every time we come to the meeting, we have to remember that we are here to be a servant to the brothers and sisters; we are here to serve the brothers and sisters and not just to listen to a message.
[94]  What they mean is that if there is a gospel meeting, they will not come, because they are saved.
[95]  The question is whether or not you should go to the meeting to strengthen the hand of the brothers so that the brothers will not have to fight alone.
[96]  Since Shanghai is so large, the brothers and sisters are all scattered, and there is little fellowship between them.
[97]  We may talk about how the brothers ought to behave as brothers, and we may also cover something related to the meetings.
[98]  Question: What does the meeting in 1 Corinthians 14 refer to?
[99]  Answer: The meeting in 1 Corinthians 14 is a meeting for the exercise of spiritual gifts.
[100]  Question: Can we forbid outside brothers from preaching at will in our meetings?
[101]  Answer: We should pray and ask God to stop the disenchanted ones in the denominations from coming into our midst.
[102]  We should deal seriously with this matter so that the disenchanted ones in the denominations will not come and express anything in our meetings.
[103]  Tonight we will discuss the mutual relationship between the meeting in Gordon Lane and that in Wen-teh Lane.
[104]  In other words, we will speak on the boundary of the local church or the extent of the border of the local church.
[105]  Before we speak on this matter, there are a few things which we need to explain to the brothers from out of town.
[106]  We also saw that, according to God s ordination, no church of God should act independently; rather it should pay attention to the move of the Body and seek for mutual harmony.
[107]  Hence, the maximum reach of a local church is the city; no boundary can be larger than the city.
[108]  In the Bible we cannot find a church that rules over one province or county.
[109]  The Bible shows us that the city is the boundary of the church.
[110]  This is why God has not made a province the unit of the church, nor has He made a nation or other political units the boundary of the church.
[111]  We have seen that the Bible takes a city or a village as the unit for an assembly.
[112]  In Shanghai, we now have a meeting in Wen-teh Lane and another in Gordon Lane.
[113]  Second, if a few thousand or a few hundred people gathered together in one place, we would not have much time to break the bread at the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord s Day evening, and there would not be a large enough cup or bread.
[114]  How should we designate the boundary line between the meetings in Gordon Lane and Wen-teh Lane?
[115]  This designation does not mean that the brothers and sisters residing to the north of the Soochow River cannot meet in Wen-teh Lane or that the brothers and sisters residing to the south of the Soochow River cannot meet in Gordon Lane.
[116]  Question: In Taichow someone asked about the matter of the laying on of hands.
[117]  Concerning the matter of receiving, I have to mention a few things.
[118]  The letters of recommendation which we send out should be of three kinds: 1 those that recommend a brother as one who has not left the denominations yet; 2 those that recommend a brother as one who is standing on the ground of the church; and 3 those that recommend a brother as one who has some gifts.
