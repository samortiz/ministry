Acts 2:46 tells us that the believers broke bread &#8220;from house to house,&#8221; and 5:42 says that &#8220;from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&#8221;...The Greek indicates that they met according to houses, which means that every house had a meeting.<sup>166</sup> Thus, the New Testament indicates that each one of us should have a meeting in our home. Of course, these home meetings should not be just with our own family; they should also include others. [Second], the New Testament also shows us that in addition to having the group meetings in the homes, the entire church should also come together in one place (1 Cor. 14:23).<sup>167</sup> In the beginning of the church life [in Acts]...the larger gatherings were needed, but the larger gatherings were not a daily need. The daily need was the group meetings.<sup>168</sup> Thus, the church should have regular separate home meetings and should gather together in one place as the need arises.<sup>169</sup> However, we need to see that the group meetings are more basic.<sup>170</sup> The big meetings can attract the people, but only the small meetings can build people up....The small meetings are the foundation of the building of the church; this is an unshakable law. If we do not keep this law, we will not have any building.<sup>171</sup> [Hence], the group meetings are the &#8220;lifeline,&#8221; the &#8220;pulse,&#8221; of our church life.<sup>172</sup></p><p>The group meeting is eighty percent of the church life, and the church life is a life in the Body. In our physical body, it is impossible for a problem in one member to be hidden from all the other members. The circulation of life in our body carries the feeling in one member to all the members. Thus, we should not hide our problems from the other members in the church life.<sup>173</sup> In saying this, I do not mean that we should open everything to others without restriction.... But we do need to learn to open our ordinary, daily matters to our fellow believers. Without the proper opening of ourselves to one another, it is difficult to practice the group meetings.<sup>174</sup></p><p>Among all the meetings in the church life, no other meeting is as intimate, as practical, and as all-inclusive as the group meeting. It includes fellowship, interceding, mutual care, and shepherding.<sup>175</sup> Furthermore, if we do not have these things, it is difficult to have the mutual teaching through asking and answering questions.<sup>176</sup> For the perfecting of the saints, there is the need of teaching in the group meetings, and in the group meetings all are teachers.<sup>177</sup> Everyone is both a teacher and a learner.<sup>178</sup></p><p>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25.<sup>179</sup> In these verses there are three crucial words: consider, incite, and exhort[ing]....To consider one another implies to remember, to have a sincere, loving concern for one another. It implies that the saints are in our heart.<sup>180</sup> [Verse 24 goes on to say] we must also incite them, stir them up. They might become cold. If so, we have to fan the fire for them.<sup>181</sup> Good works here refers to giving something to others freely or doing something freely for others. To give a financial gift or to care for a sick brother is a good work. There is the need for many such good works in the Body. We need to incite one another to love and to this kind of good work. Verse 25 also says that we are to exhort one another.<sup>182</sup> You exhort me and I exhort you; you learn and I also learn....According to this portion of the Word, we must [consider], incite, and exhort one another mutually.<sup>183</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
