Hospitable</h2><p>Another qualification of an overseer is that he must be hospitable. Hospitality requires love, care for people, and endurance. All these virtues are required if one is to qualify to be an elder.<p>Nothing is more bothersome than giving hospitality. Hospitality tests the qualifications of elders. The principle of hospitality is giving without receiving; it is suffering without requiring anything in return. Hospitality means sacrifice with joy, but without recompense. An elder must have a heart and a spirit for such hospitality.<h2 class=head3>7. Apt to Teach</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul says that an elder should be apt to teach. To teach here is similar to parents teaching their children. An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of the local church.<p>If a parent has not received a proper education, it will be difficult for him to teach his children. Likewise, if the elders would be apt to teach, they need to be knowledgeable. For example, an elder should be able to explain what the mystery of Christ is. If a brother is not knowledgeable concerning the truth, he is disqualified from the eldership. An elder should be able to teach the saints like a parent helps a child with his homework. However, this does not mean that every elder should be a teacher. It is not necessary for parents to be teachers in order to help their children with homework. Similarly, not all elders are teachers, but they all should be apt to teach.<h2 class=head3>8. Not an Excessive Drinker</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul lists other qualifications: &#8220;Not an excessive drinker, not a striker, but forbearing, not contentious, not fond of money.&#8221; When Paul says that an elder should not be an excessive drinker, he, of course, has in mind not an excessive drinker of wine. However, the principle here is that an elder should not be excessive in anything. This requires strong self-control. In the matters of food and clothing, for example, an elder should not be excessive. This tests his ability to exercise self-control.<h2 class=head3>9. Not a Striker</h2><p>The next requirement, &#8220;not a striker,&#8221; is related to the control of one&#8217;s temper. This implies a strong restraint of the temper. An elder should be one who does not lose his temper.<h2 class=head3>10. Forbearing</h2><p>To be forbearing is to be yielding, gentle, mild, reasonable, and considerate in dealing with others. It is to deal with people without strictness.<h2 class=head3>11. Not Contentious</h2><p>An elder should not be contentious. He should not be quarrelsome; rather, he should be peaceable and not debate with others or contend with them. Even if someone comes to fight with him, he should not fight back, but should learn not to be contentious.<h2 class=head3>12. Not Fond of Money</h2><p>An elder should not be fond of money. Money is a test to all men. An elder must be pure in money matters, especially since the church fund is under the elders&#8217; management (Acts 11:30). An elder must realize that the money which passes through his hands is not for his personal gain. He should not have even the thought of monetary gain.<h2 class=head3>13. Managing Well His Own Household</h2><p>In verses 4 and 5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;One who manages well his own household, having his children in subjection with all gravity; (but if anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)&#8221; Managing well his own household is a proof that one is qualified to take the oversight of a local church. An elder should exercise to manage his household well and maintain it in good order. It is clear that anyone who does not know how to manage his own household cannot take care of the church of God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus and Philemon &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
