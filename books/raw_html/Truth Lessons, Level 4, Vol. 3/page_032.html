	 <h2 class="head3">1. The Six Virtues,<br />
Which Are Also Six Governing Aspects,<br />
of a Life That Lives Christ</h2>
<p>The first virtue of these six governing aspects is &ldquo;what things are true.&rdquo; The word <em>true</em> means &ldquo;truthful ethically,&rdquo; not merely true in matter of fact. In the expression of the life that lives Christ there can be no falsehood, no lying. Everything that we do or say must be truthful. No one who lives Christ should practice falsehood of any kind. A life that is the expression of Christ is a truthful one. The second virtue is &ldquo;what things are dignified.&rdquo; This indicates that if we live Christ, we must be dignified, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and honorable before man. When others see us bearing such dignity, they will be inspired and have a profound respect for us. The third virtue is &ldquo;what things are righteous.&rdquo; This refers to what is right, not just, before God and man. A person who lives Christ always maintains a proper relationship with God and with man. The fourth virtue is &ldquo;what things are pure.&rdquo; The word <em>pure</em> means &ldquo;single in intention and action, without pretense and without any mixture.&rdquo; The fifth virtue is &ldquo;what things are lovely.&rdquo; The word <em>lovely</em> means &ldquo;lovable, agreeable, and endearing.&rdquo; The last virtue is &ldquo;what things are well spoken of.&rdquo; This indicates that as Christians we should do whatever is of good repute, renowned, attractive, winning, and gracious. If we live Christ, we will surely have a life that is an expression of all these virtues.</p>
<p>On the basis of Paul&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (1:21), we can rightly say that the virtues in verse 8 of chapter 4 are not things apart from Christ. These are not merely human virtues; the reality of these virtues is Christ Himself. Not only so, if we carefully consider these virtues, we will realize that in ourselves it is impossible for us to have such a life and to have such an expression. Therefore, we must experience what Paul speaks of in verse 13, &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Now that Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27), He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within. By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ; that is, he could express Christ in all these virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Summing Up of the Six Virtues<br />
of the Christian Life</h2>
<p>Toward the end of Philippians 4:8 Paul changes his expression and says, &ldquo;If there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; <em>Virtue</em> means &ldquo;excellence,&rdquo; that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action. <em>Praise</em> here refers to things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue. Virtue and praise, categorized as &ldquo;if any,&rdquo; are not two additional items but values of the six items already covered. Virtue and praise sum up the six items into two categories. This is to say that every item of the six foregoing virtues is excellent and has something worthy of praise. Paul says that we should &ldquo;take account of these things&rdquo;; that is, we should think on them, ponder them, consider them.</p>
<p>How excellent is the expression of the life that lives Christ! In each of these excellent aspects there is some virtue and something worthy of praise. The picture portrayed by these items is much more virtuous than that portrayed in the Ten Commandments. These virtues produce excellence and praise. The praise is not only to God but also to us; others will praise us for all these excellent virtues. In our experience of Christ we must attain to the point that whatever we do is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. These virtues will be an excellency in our behavior and will cause others to praise God and also to praise us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. WATCHING AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>In our enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity we must learn to watch and pray. We should not remain in any kind of sleeping condition. Rather, we need to watch over the situation concerning ourselves, the brothers and sisters, the church in which we are, and even the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should also watch and pray concerning the Lord&rsquo;s interest, His present move, the world situation, and the condition regarding the unsaved. As believers, we should be concerned for these things, learning to watch over and to pray concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Entering into Temptation</h2>
<p>Matthew 26:41 says, &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that in spiritual things our spirit is often ready, but our flesh is weak. It is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time; therefore, the Lord reminds us to watch and pray so that we do not enter into temptation.</p>
