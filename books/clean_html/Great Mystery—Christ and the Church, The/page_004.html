<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In considering our vision, we will not look at the revelation on the surface of the Bible, for many can recite this revelation. Our need is to consider the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Then we are told what God created on the first day. Chapter 1 also speaks of God&rsquo;s restoration and further creation. We can understand what God created when we read these verses. However, there is a mystery in this chapter, for verse 26 begins with &ldquo;God said, Let Us...&rdquo; This &ldquo;Us&rdquo; is a mystery. Is there one God or many Gods? To say that there are many Gods is heresy. But how can God refer to Himself as &ldquo;Us&rdquo;? This is a mystery.</p>
<p>In verse 26 God said, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; Have we seen God&rsquo;s image or His likeness? Do we know that we were made in God&rsquo;s image, according to His likeness? This is a mystery. The Bible says that no one has seen God and that God is invisible (John 1:18; Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17). How can the invisible God have an image? If He has an image, can He be seen by men? Furthermore, what is the distinction between image and likeness? Theologians cannot research this matter thoroughly, nor can they give a clear explanation concerning this matter. Hence, Bible expositors cannot expound the word <em>Us</em> in Genesis 1:26, nor can they explain the words <em>image</em> and <em>likeness.</em> This proves that there is a mystery in Genesis 1 that is not easy to utter.</p>
<p>We need to ask, is man in the image of God or in the image of man? Is man according to the likeness of God or according to the likeness of man? It is correct to say that we are men, but man has the image of God and the likeness of God. Some theologians may think that it is a heresy, blasphemy, to say this. How can a small man dare to say that he bears God&rsquo;s image and likeness? But we know that this is not blasphemy; it is the revelation of a mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 says that the plants and animals are &ldquo;according to their kind&rdquo; (vv. 11-12, 21, 24-25). Dogs are according to the dog kind, horses are according to the horse kind, and cattle are according to the cattle kind. The same is true of grass, flowers, and trees. Peaches are according to the peach kind, apricots are according to the apricot kind, peonies are according to the peony kind, and chrysanthemums are according to the chrysanthemum kind. Everything is according to its kind. However, according to what kind is man? Is man according to mankind or God&rsquo;s kind? The Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Therefore, man was created according to God&rsquo;s kind. We have been criticized because we speak according to the Bible and say that man is according to God&rsquo;s kind. People say that we speak heresy. Our critics say that because man is man, not God, how can man be according to God&rsquo;s kind? They say that only God is according to God&rsquo;s kind; therefore, man cannot be according to God&rsquo;s kind. Nevertheless, the Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s kind. Man being according to God&rsquo;s kind is a mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is not simple to understand the truth in the Bible. The superficial revelation of the Bible is easy to understand, but the mystery in the Bible is difficult to understand. I have given many messages in the United States concerning the mingling of God and man. Some say that these messages are heresy, because I am saying that man can be God. However, the Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Let us use a glove as an example. A glove is made in the image of a hand with the purpose of containing the hand. God made man in His image with the purpose of entering into man. Romans 11 reveals that the believers have been grafted into God (vv. 17-24), and chapter 9 says that man is a vessel to contain God (vv. 23-24). We would not put a square object in a round box. A vessel is shaped according to the object it is to contain. The beginning of the Bible speaks of God making man in His own image, according to His own likeness, to indicate that one day God would become one with man.</p>
<p>Some believe that the Bible is concerning God creating man; God sending His Son to save fallen man; man&rsquo;s sins being forgiven; man repenting, believing, and being saved; and man eventually going to heaven. This, however, is the surface of the Bible. The Bible is concerning the deeper revelation. The first chapter of the Bible reveals that one day God would be joined with man, become one with man. God wants to be man&rsquo;s content; therefore, He made man in His image and likeness so that man would be a vessel to contain Him. When God enters into man, He is joined with man, becomes one with man. A cup that contains coffee is a coffee cup. Similarly, a man who contains God is a God-man.</p>
<p>Unless a person contains God, he is empty, being without content. Those who are not saved are without content, and their lives are meaningless. But those who are saved are not empty, meaningless, or without content. We are full of content, and our content is God Himself. This is not being proud; this is a fact. Believing in Jesus is not a matter of being saved to go to heaven; rather, believing in Jesus is a matter of being saved to contain God. When we contain God, we become God-men. Our vessels were formerly a mess, filthy, and defiled. But now that the precious blood of the Lord Jesus has redeemed us, we are washed, we are clean, and the divine life has come into us to be our content. We are God-containing vessels. This is the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God put man in front of a tree. That tree has a special name; it is called the tree of life (vv. 8-9). In putting man in front of the tree of life, God seemed to be telling man, &ldquo;You have My image and My likeness, but you do not have My life. At best, you are a photograph of Me.&rdquo; The man whom God made was like a photograph of God; he did not have God&rsquo;s life. God wanting man to take the tree of life indicates that He wanted to enter into man in order to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The truth in the Bible is that God wants man to receive Him. The Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). One day the Word became flesh (v. 14). This incarnated Word lived as a man among His disciples and said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (6:51). By linking these verses with Genesis 2, we see that God created man as a vessel with the intention of being received by man. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57).</p>
<p>Eating the Lord is also a mystery that the majority of Christians do not know. In 1958 I was in Taipei and spoke on John 6:57. From then on we have been speaking of eating, drinking, and enjoying God. One time after a meeting a brother who is a professor said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your message today was good, but one word was very barbaric. It is barbaric to talk about eating Jesus.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, I am not the one who is barbaric. This is what the Lord Jesus Himself said.&rdquo; This shows that even though we know the Bible on the surface, we do not actually know the Bible. Many Christians do not know the truth of eating Jesus.</p>
<p>Those who study nutrition say, &ldquo;You are what you eat.&rdquo; In other words, we are an aggregate of the food that we eat. The rice, bread, fish, meat, eggs, vegetables, and fruits that we eat become us after they are digested. This mystery is in the Bible: God wants to be the bread of life to man. Only after He is our bread of life can He be our real content.</p>
<p>The beginning of the Bible matches the ending of the Bible. In Revelation 2 the Lord promised, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (v. 7). At the end of Revelation the Lord also promised, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life&rdquo; (22:14). The tree of life is God Himself. To wash one&rsquo;s robes is to keep one&rsquo;s conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb (7:14; 1 John 1:7). This is how we are qualified to enjoy God. This is a deep mystery in the Bible; it is not the revelation on the surface.</p>
<p>Not only does the beginning of the Bible match its ending; the entire Bible is consistent. In John 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; (v. 5). This is a mystery. This is a picture of grafting. The Lord is the vine, and we are the branches. In our natural birth we are not branches in the Lord; we were grafted into Him when we were regenerated (cf. Rom. 11:17, 24). Grafting unites the life of two trees and mingles them into one in order to bear fruit. Grafting is a simple example, but the reality contained in this example is not simple. This is the way that we abide in the Lord, and He abides in us. We human beings are abiding in God, and the Triune God is abiding in us. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>After the Gospel of John and the book of Acts we come to Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. The first Epistle of Paul is the Epistle to the Romans. Romans 6:5 says, &ldquo;If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; This is a mystery within a mystery. The Bible scholar F. L. Godet once said that the words <em>grown together</em> in this verse refer to a union in life. In such a life union we may partake of Christ&rsquo;s life and characteristics and thus grow in life. This is a deep mystery, not superficial revelation.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 Paul speaks of the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2). This is a deeper mystery. There is a law that regulates us from within. This law is the law of the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is the Triune God. The Triune God is the Spirit of life, and He has become a law within us. This is exceedingly mysterious. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the word <em>mystery</em> is used many times. Paul says that Christ is the mystery of God, that the church is the mystery of Christ, and that Christ and the church are the great mystery (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32). These are matters of the Spirit, for the Triune God has become the life-giving Spirit, who is now dwelling in our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; Rom. 8:11).</p>
<p>In Revelation John speaks of seven golden lampstands, which are the seven churches (1:20). This is also a mystery. In Revelation the Spirit of God is the seven Spirits (v. 4), and the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6). This is much more mysterious. The ultimate manifestation of the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit, who is the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the second person of the Trinity. The church was produced in the New Testament age. The church is a lampstand, and the lampstand is the mystery of the church. Ultimately, the church becomes the New Jerusalem, which is the mystery of mysteries, the totality of all the mysteries. In the New Jerusalem there are the tree of life, the river of water of life, the man-creating God, and the created man. The New Jerusalem is the totality, the aggregate, of all the mysteries. This is the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Are we Christians with merely the revelation on the surface of the Bible, or do we know the deep mystery? Our being Christians is also a mystery. Eventually, we will become the totality of mysteries, the New Jerusalem. Then we will enjoy all the mysteries. This is the deep mystery in the Bible. Paul told the Corinthians that he preached this mystery, which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart, yet God has revealed it to us (1 Cor. 2:9-10). This is not the revelation on the surface of the Bible but the mystery hidden in the Bible. This is what the Lord wants to recover in His recovery today.</p>
