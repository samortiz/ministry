   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people have the wrong concept that a man believes in the gospel because he has heard the right teachings, or because he is touched in his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this is far from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who base their acceptance of the Lord on emotional impulses will not last, nor will those who are convinced by persuasion in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is nothing wrong with using the mind and the emotion, but these things are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man is not saved through emotion and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A sinner falls at the Lord's feet because the speaker's spirit has released light through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as our spirit gushes out, others are struck.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the reason we need a released spirit to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A coal miner was greatly used by the Lord in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wrote a book entitled Seen and Heard in which he described his experience with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were deeply touched by this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This brother was not an educated or gifted man; he was only an ordinary brother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But his absolute consecration to the Lord became the basis for the Lord to use him greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you know what was so special about him?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His spirit could be released easily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He started to preach at the age of twenty-three, when he first experienced salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one meeting the word of a preacher kindled a burning desire within him to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He asked to be allowed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he stood up, he was unable to say anything, even though his heart was burning with fire for lost souls.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His tears came down like a torrent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end he could only utter one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's Spirit filled the meeting, and everyone was convicted of his own sin and waywardness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here was a man who, in spite of his young age, was broken in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not have much to say, yet his spirit was released and men were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He led many people to salvation during his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we read his biography, we sense that he was a man with a released spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to preach the gospel is to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the hardness of the outer man is removed and the outer man is broken, the spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the very sight of an unsaved person compels us to do something to save him, it means that our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The preaching of the gospel has everything to do with the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the outer man is broken, our spirit will be released and will touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is our spirit that reaches others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is God's Spirit that touches the darkened spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this happens, a man is saved, and no reason can account for this change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when the outer man chokes the spirit, God does not have a way through us and the gospel will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We always have to pay attention to the matter of the breaking of the outer man because all of our problems lie in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we, the person, are not dealt with, it is useless for us to memorize more teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only thing that will bring salvation to men is for our spirit to touch others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our spirit touches others' spirits, they will fall on their face before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our spirit is discharged in a strong way, they will have no choice but to prostrate themselves before the Lord.</S>
