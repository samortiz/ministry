   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RAISING UP THE BELIEVERS AS GOD'S FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After studying the entire New Testament, we have found that raising up a church is like raising a family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In raising a family, the main thing is that the family has to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is the house of God, that is, the household of God, God's family Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A local church is God's "local family."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to raise up this family in the same way that we raise up our physical families.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we must beget children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, we must feed these newborn babes in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, simply to have a family that is feeding babies is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is the way, the procedure, to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The goal is to raise up these little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Raising up children does not merely mean to feed them, but also to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This perfecting is clearly revealed in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This chapter says that the ascended Head, Christ, has given gifts to men for the perfecting of the saints vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>8, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These gifts fall into four main categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers v. 11 . The Head gave these four kinds of gifts directly to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Ephesians 4, these four kinds of gifts should do the perfecting work on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Parents, after feeding their babes for a few years, have to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is mainly by teaching them, by educating them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person would only eat but never receive an education, that person would be useless in society.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At least a person should learn a trade.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In raising up families to form the society of a nation, there is the need of births, then feeding, and then perfecting, educating.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the perfecting, every saint needs to exercise to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the New Testament, prophesying builds up the Body of Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is fully revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This chapter unveils the direct building up of the church in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we cannot practice 1 Corinthians 14 so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We first have to grow and be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To graduate with a bachelor's degree, one must first pass through kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high school, and then four years of college.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To receive a master's degree, one has to go to graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To receive a doctorate requires even more study.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these steps kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school are for our perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PERFECTING ONE ANOTHER IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In studying the New Testament, I found that there are these same steps of maturity in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we must bring sinners to be regenerated to become babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then these babes need to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus tells us in John 15:16 to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 21 the Lord charges us to feed His lambs v. 15 . To feed the Lord's lambs is the way to insure that our fruit remains.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter learned this from the Lord; so in writing his first Epistle, he charges the newborn babes to long for the pure milk of the word 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, newborn babes cannot eat or drink by themselves; they need a nursing mother to feed them 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We suffered in the past because we did not follow our preaching of the gospel with the proper feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without the proper feeding, a newborn babe can die prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This has happened among us many times over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then after feeding, a young believer needs some teaching, some education.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 10:24 says, "Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 24 uses two very positive words consider and incite.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are to consider one another, we are to incite one another to love, and we are to incite one another to good works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that we have to consider others, remember others, and take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must also incite them, stir them up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They might become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If so, we have to fan the fire for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need this among us, but how can this be carried out?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 24 ends with a comma, and verse 25 continues, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To not forsake our assembling is to have our own meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not to have a general meeting, but a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The group meeting is your meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a general meeting it is hard for you to consider one another or to incite one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This can only be done with a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If there are too many in a meeting, it is hard to incite one another or consider one another in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have been meeting with most of you in meetings of about two hundred for quite a long time, but I still do not know many of your names.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if you would come to my home and meet with me in my living room in a group meeting, I would get to know each of you intimately.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many of us have been meeting together for fifteen years, yet we do not even know one another.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all need to have our own group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not enough to attend others' group meetings; each of us needs our own.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The group meeting is not the coming together of the church as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the whole church comes together, that is not a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hebrews 10:24-25 describes a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In these verses there are three items that characterize the group meeting: considering, inciting, and exhorting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Without a group meeting, how could we exhort one another?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we come together in the group meeting, you can incite me, and I can incite you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can stir up one another to consider others, to love others, and to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To consider, incite, and exhort one another, we need the group meeting.</S>
