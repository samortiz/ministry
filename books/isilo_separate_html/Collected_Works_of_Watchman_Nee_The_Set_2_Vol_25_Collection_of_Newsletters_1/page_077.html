However, the word in 1 Timothy 2:12 is "teach" in the original Greek. It means to teach as a teacher. God does not allow sisters to do this. The word in 1 Corinthians 11:4-5 is "prophesy" in the original Greek. God allows sisters to do this (Acts 21:9). First Corinthians 14:35 mentions "speaking in the church," which is in the meeting of the church (of course, there are brothers there). God does not allow sisters to do this either. Therefore, in these three passages of the Bible, we see that a sister (1) cannot teach as a teacher or define doctrines, either in public or in private, (2) can prophesy, but (3) cannot speak in the church meetings no matter whether it is a teaching or a prophesying.</P><P>Long hair is God's natural sign to remind the woman to submit to authority and not be the head. Head covering is an outward sign that the woman submits to authority. Long hair manifests God's ordination for woman (so it is a woman's glory); head covering manifests a woman's submission to God (so it can be called a woman's beauty). (Oh, God has such an ordination for woman that He would use her to manifest His wisdom. She is so glorious! It is so beautiful when she obeys God's ordination!) Long hair is a declaration that speaks forth God's ordination for woman; head covering is an amen that women respond to God. If a woman does not cover her head, she does not obey God's ordination. If a woman cuts her hair or shaves her head, she overthrows God's ordination. Therefore, a sister should (1) not shave her head or cut her hair; rather, she should allow her hair to grow long to exhibit God's ordination for woman in the natural realm, and (2) cover her head to express her obedience to God's ordination by her actions&mdash;Editor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Shih Chiu Jung:</P><P>I think you have already received my answer last week. I have not received the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters to date. Our locality had an eight-day conference from the twenty-second to the twenty-ninth of this month during a break in the farming work. In this conference, we preached two principles: (1) the emphasis in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and 24 of the salvation of the believer's soul and its relationship to the Lord's return, and (2) only those moved by the Holy Spirit and who realize the Father's love will bear the fruits of repentance, receive salvation, and bear spiritual fruit. By the Lord's blessing, both messages edified the spiritual life of the brothers and sisters. By the Lord's special grace, six brothers and eight sisters were baptized into the Lord's name during this conference. There are still a few who will be baptized in a few days. Please greet the brothers and sisters for me. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother who is in the same way in the Lord,<br>Chu En Sheng<br>July 30, 1934</P><P>Mailing address: 112 Ch'i Hsien Ch'iao, P'u Tung, Shanghai</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM TA CH'IAO, HUAI AN,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who have received the heavenly calling with us:</P><P>We few country farmers have been saved for six or seven years. We confess that in the past we disgraced the Lord's grace and buried the Lord's glory. Recently, the Lord has expressed the power of His cross in our environment and has used His miraculous ways to save quite a few people. We cannot cover up the Lord's glory any longer. We have written the history of our meeting and its present condition so that the Lord's name may be praised.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How the Meeting in Ta Ch'aio Began</H2><P>Ta Ch'iao is a small town in the northwest region of Huai An County about sixty miles from the city. We began meeting there in Mr. Ting Keng Fu's house. Mr. Ting's name is Yi Yuan. He was a Presbyterian preacher. Later, he quit his preaching post as a result of a message by Chi Yung Tung concerning leaving the denominations. He gathered us together to his house to meet in the Lord's name. We began meeting in December of 1928, but we did not establish the Lord's table until October of 1929. There were only three brothers and four sisters who broke bread together to remember the Lord at the time. The first years were very peaceful.</P><P>Then all of a sudden, Mr. Ting's house was flooded. In the flood of July 1931, Mr. Ting's house was washed away by the water, and his whole family moved, so our meetings stopped for more than four months. Later, we received the Lord's gift and rebuilt the house, so our meetings resumed.</P><P>Unfortunately, problems came again not long after. Mr. Ting's house was repossessed by the landowner. At the end of 1932, he tore down his house and rebuilt it in Chang Chia Chuang, more than twenty miles from us. We moved our meeting place to Brother Hsin Ling's house and continued to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. Although our meeting had met with difficulties several times and our numbers were small, the Lord never dropped us. He continued to keep us on His ground. This is how our meeting was started. Now we mention something of the Lord's work among us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
