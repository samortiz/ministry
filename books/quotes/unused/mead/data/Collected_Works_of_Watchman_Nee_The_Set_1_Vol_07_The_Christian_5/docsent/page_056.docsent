   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESURRECTION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Since you went back, I have been reading two chapters of the Bible a day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 27:52 says, "And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the resurrection of the dead saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is a record in another place of the Bible which says that Christ is the firstborn from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could some get resurrected before the Lord Jesus died?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please explain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chien, Changchou</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: The Bible only considers Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection 1 Cor 15:20 , but He was not the first person who resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament, Elisha raised the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He raised at least three persons from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The resurrection of these saints should not be considered as something strange.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meaning of Christ being the firstfruit is that He is the only One who had His kind of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE HUSBAND IN ROMANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Question: What does "the husband" in Romans 7:2-3 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have heard some say that it refers to the "old self" the flesh, whereas others say that it refers to the "law."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Answer: It refers to the passions for sins in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the "woman," and the "passions for sins" v. 5 is the "husband." When the husband is living, the woman is bound by the law v. 2 . When the passions for sins are living, we are bound by the law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The passions for sins become dead through the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way, the law also becomes dead v. 4 , and we are free.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SEVENTY-FIVE OR SEVENTY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: How do you explain the "seventy-five souls" in Acts 7:14 and the seventy souls in Genesis 46:27?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Answer: The seventy souls is the number of the house of Jacob Gen 46:27 , which are "his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed" v. 7 . The "seventy-five souls" includes all of Jacob's relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 7:14 is the number for "all his family," which in the original language means "relatives."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, there were five more relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was reasonable to include them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the two passages do not contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ABRAHAM AND JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: Genesis 33:18-19 and Joshua 24:32 both speak about Jacob buying a parcel of a field from Hamor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why in Acts 7:16 does it say that Abraham did it?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please explain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Answer: Acts 7:16 is in harmony with Genesis 50:13.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Genesis 49:29-32 and 50:13, Jacob was buried in the parcel of land that Abraham bought.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 7:16 was right on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in between Abraham's purchasing of the land Gen 23 and Jacob's purchasing of the land, there were about eighty years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During those eighty years, the landlord came again to take over the land; Jacob did not fight with him, but repurchased the same land that his grandfather had bought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The land which Jacob purchased was the same lot Abraham bought; Shechem's father and Ephron were both Hamor's descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two points are explained clearly in Acts 7:16.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there is no contradiction here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: How do you explain the "four hundred years" in Genesis 15:13 and Acts 7:6, and the "four hundred thirty years" in Exodus 12:40?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Answer: The Israelites "dwelt" in Egypt for four hundred thirty years Exo 12:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, during the first thirty years, they lived in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During those four hundred thirty years, they were only afflicted four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two portions are in perfect harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE PROPHECY OF JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: How do you explain Genesis 49:3-27?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Answer: Genesis 49 is Jacob's blessing for the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33 stresses God's purpose more, whereas the emphasis here is on their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This chapter is divided into four sections, with every three tribes comprising a section.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, we see man's natural condition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Zebulun, Issachar, and Dan we see that, although God has the blessings, there are still forces that pull one away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, we see the result of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verses 5 through 7 speak of Simeon and Levi's cruelty; chapter thirty-four is one example of it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 7 was eventually fully fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nothing more needs to be said of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For Simeon, see Joshua 19:1-9.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verses 8 through 12 speak of Judah's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>David came from this tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Shiloh is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verses 11 and 12 show the state of the millennial kingdom, where Christ will reign.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 13 speaks of Zebulun's commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verses 14 to 15 speak of Issachar's love for a quiet life and hard labor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 16 is Dan's latter state.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 17 is related to his apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 18 is Jacob's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 19 is Gad's initial defeat and final victory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Verse 20 tells of Asher's production.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Verse 21 speaks of Naphtali's goodly words.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Verses 22 to 26 mention the blessings received by Joseph, who typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 27 is Benjamin's future.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His condition, as such, partly typifies the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We cannot relate them all in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the Lord tarries, please read Meditations on Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, you can look up the history of the tribes sequentially in the holy Scriptures, and you can find the fulfillment to all these prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>P.S. Concerning the Companion Bible you mentioned, its price is approximately thirty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Aside from explaining some original texts, there is nothing else in it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although at the back of the book there are more than a hundred short articles, most of them are too subjective, and many of them are not even scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are many commentaries of the Bible in English, but none of them is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Either they come short in the spiritual interpretation, or they come short in critical analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are many more commentaries that are banned by some denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Probably there is not one perfect commentary in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To find such a one, you have to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As far as my observation is concerned, Darby's Synopsis of the Bible is the best commentary.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A set of five books costs ten dollars and can be bought from The Christian Book Room located at 4 Kunsan Garden, Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Darby does fall into the denominational type of arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His study of the Bible is quite deep, and those who read these books have to read them three or four times before they can fully understand their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, this set still has its shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is left to the readers to select them carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>As far as Chinese commentaries are concerned, either translated or written, most of them are too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is indeed a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Question: When it is necessary for several persons to work together, is it improper to have some kind of organization?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Why can it not be considered as a small flock in one accord?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Answer: Saints can work together without any organization.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Barnabas and Paul's preaching of the gospel together is one example of it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not consider several persons laboring together to be an organization automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We can regard it as a small flock in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, in working together, it is possible to have organizations or be organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is something that we have to be careful about.</S>
