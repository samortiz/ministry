<H1 CLASS=TITLE>JUDGMENT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 36</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 9:27</H1><P>This is one of the most serious verses in the whole Bible. It makes one feel uncomfortable when reading it and displeased when hearing it. "And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment." This is what I want to speak about today. The matter which has been reserved has two parts. The first part is that man will die. The second part is that after death there is judgment. If you can escape the first thing God has reserved—death, you can also escape the second thing God has reserved—judgment. According to God's appointment, first, everyone must die, and second, everyone must receive judgment after death. If the first appointment, death, is fulfilled, then the second appointment, judgment, will also be fulfilled. Our friends who are sitting here need not ask if they will receive judgment; they only need to ask if they will die. The topic of my message today is judgment. This is something unpleasant to your ears and something about which I do not like to speak. But we do not have a choice. Unpleasant as it is, you must hear, and I must speak. If death is real, judgment must be real. If you are bound to die, you are bound to receive judgment. If you can escape death, then you can also escape judgment.</P><P>The Bible tells us many things that are facts. If you believe them, they are facts. If you do not believe them, they are still facts. A fact is not going to change into a non-fact just because of disbelief. A fact is always a fact.</P><P>One fact which the Bible tells us about is God. It does not matter whether or not you believe there is a God; God is a fact. For example, the sun is in the sky, and whether a blind man believes in its existence or denies its existence, the sun is still a fact.</P><P>Another fact which the Bible tells us about is sin. It does not matter if a man believes or refuses to believe that there is sin; the fact of sin still remains.</P><P>The Bible not only tells us the facts about God and sin, it also tells us about death. This again is a fact. The Bible speaks about death more often than men do in their daily conversation. If you believe that death is real, it will come to you. If you do not believe that death is real, it will still come to you.</P><P>The Bible tells us another fact about the future. Many do not pay much attention to this fact because it is about the future. But this fact is as real as the three mentioned above. This fact is judgment. Judgment will occur whether you believe in the fact, or whether you do not believe in it. All kinds of sins—small or big, civilized or crude, attractive or ugly, committed by reputable people or disreputable people—are subject to judgment by God. Judgment from God is a fact. You can choose to believe or deny it; nevertheless, judgment is a fact. I have disregarded formalities to straightforwardly tell you about this. I do not need to spend time to cite evidence to prove that there is judgment. Facts do not require proof. God is there just as the Bible says He is. The Bible speaks of God at its very beginning. It never elaborates any proof as to how there is a God. Facts do not require proof. The Bible does not need to prove that you have sin because, in fact, you have sin. The Bible does not need to prove that you will die because, in fact, you will die. Likewise, the Bible does not need to prove that there will be a judgment because, in fact, there will be a judgment.</P><P>My friends, I want to ask you a question today, "Have your sins been resolved?" Perhaps you have heard the gospel a few times, yet you have not resolved the problem of your sin; and you are not yet saved. I must tell you that as certain as death is, judgment is just as certain. You cannot tell when you are going to die. Neither can you tell when you are going to receive judgment. Therefore, resolve your problem of sin today. If it is not resolved, you do not know how dangerous it is. Many people think that judgment is not that important. However, if you do not resolve your problem of sin today and do not deal with the question of judgment today, the judgment will be without mercy for you in the future. I exhort you not to take your meal or go to sleep until this problem of sin is resolved. This question is immensely important. You must deal with this matter thoroughly before God today. Otherwise, when judgment comes, it will be too late.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULT OF JUDGMENT</H2><P>The Bible not only tells us that there will be judgment, it also tells us the result of judgment. In the future, God will judge the sins of all men in the world. He will recompense those who do not know Him and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished by eternal perdition (2 Thes. 1:8-9) and go to hell. While the Bible tells us that God loves the world, it also tells us about the fire of hell. If we have not obtained the grace of forgiveness, this is most dangerous. The unbelievers will depart from the Lord's face and go to hell. This is eternal perdition, and no one can escape it.</P>
