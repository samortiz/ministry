   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ as righteousness is found in 1 Corinthians 1:30.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse tells us that God has made Christ our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The righteousness of Christ is the good conduct performed by Christ when He lived on the earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the personal virtue of Christ while He lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ becoming righteousness means that God gives Christ to us, making Him our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The righteousness of Christ refers to the goodness of Christ, whereas Christ becoming righteousness refers to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of the five offerings, the righteousness of Christ is equivalent to the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meal offering contains no blood because it signifies the living, good conduct, and virtue of the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of the five offerings, Christ as righteousness is equivalent to the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before God, this offering is a sweet savor; it typifies Christ being acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With Christ as our righteousness, we offer Him up as we come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, God accepts us as He accepts Christ, and God considers us perfect even as Christ is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sin offering is offered as the propitiation for the sin of our entire life, and the trespass offering is offered for our daily sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These two offerings deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The burnt offering causes God to consider us as good as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Old Testament uses the phrase "Jehovah our righteousness" Jer 33:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that God Himself is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Christ as our righteousness, we can answer all of God's demands.</S>
