Many things in this publication are directed to brothers and sisters who are in fellowship with us and learning to serve together with us. There are many places with which we are not acquainted, but which have earnestly requested our publication. We feel we are obligated to share this publication with them. We hope you would do your best to understand what you are reading and try not to misunderstand. If you misunderstand, what benefit will you obtain?</p><p>2) The new issues of The Christian and The Present Testimony will be delayed. Please forgive us.</p><p>3) There are still some copies of the fourth issue of The Testimony. Those who want copies should send us a letter. We will limit it to one copy per person until all have been given out.</p><p>Distribution Department, The Gospel Book Room<br />October 1950</p><h2 class="head1">A NECESSARY WORD OF CLARIFICATION</h2><p>Recently some outside publications have criticized our testimony and attacked our co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee. We have remained silent about these publications because we do not like to argue. On the one hand, we wanted to learn the lessons before the Lord, and on the other hand, we wanted to allow the Lord Himself to vindicate us. In the final analysis, the thoughts and desires of everyone's heart will be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would always fear Him! With respect to the person of Brother Watchman Nee, however, we can testify in one accord before the Lord that he is one of God's faithful servants. Although he engages in some form of business, his goal has never been to gain anything for himself. We are all in one accord with him in the matter of the truth, in the matter of the service, and in the matter of his business. We respectfully announce this to all the brothers and sisters who care for us, and we ask you to pray for us.</p><p>Tang Shou-ling, Yu Cheng-hua, Chang Kuang-rong,<br />Stephen Kaung, Tu Tsong-chen, David Hsu, Chu Chen,<br />Chang Yu-zhi, Miao Yun-chun, Ruth Lee, Peace Wang,<br />Phoebe Chang<br />October 22, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY TANG XING</h2><p>The editor of the former Last Days Magazine (it is now called The Christian Digest) has always been a pastor in a denomination, so he naturally carries the tendencies of his background. He has maintained a great amount of communication with me, but he has never taken this way. The article entitled "Hastening the Lord's Coming," which appeared in the fourth issue of that magazine, was written by me as a favor to a friend. I had no other intention in writing it. Before publication of the article, I knew nothing about what he would write concerning me in the editor's introduction at the end of my article. I have always condemned sectarianism according to God's word. I am writing this explanation because the brothers and sisters from many places have written to inquire about the matter.</p><p>Tang Xing<br />October 18, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_108.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 109</div><br></body></html>
