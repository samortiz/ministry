   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Respected by All the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You need to continue working until one day all the brothers and sisters respect the meeting of the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They will know that this day or this half a day is the time the responsible brothers go before God to take care of things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I often think that the meeting of the overseers is like the prayer room of John G. Paton's father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I often feel that in the whole world there was not another father like him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That old father may not have been aware of what happened, but his few sons all knew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His house was not very large.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On one side was a room, on the other side was a kitchen, and in the middle there was a little study.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the door of this little study was shut, all the sons knew that their father had gone before God to deal with things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At such a time, no child dared to make a noise, and everyone walked softly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They could not forget the sighings they heard from inside that room even forty or fifty years afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paton himself said, "Even today I can still hear my father interceding for me in that room.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that this was a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should also let all the saints know that the day the responsible brothers deal with things before God is a designated day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some brothers have given their all to go before God on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, you will see something issue out from the church; the church will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the matter of the overseers' meeting is upon the shoulders of you responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let me say again that you need to start from the center of the work in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do a strong, absolute, and serious work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Afterward, you can invite the brothers from out of town.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two Different Aspects</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before God we need two different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we need the fellowship of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After paying attention to this matter in our midst for twenty years, I think that we are gradually making progress.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was different twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank God that today this situation has had a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, at least, the saints have feelings toward one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, we need to know God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brotherly love is one thing, and being a servant before God is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need to take orders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to go out to work, before we go we need to hear the word before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to learn these things together in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Most Solemn Time</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to know that no hour is more solemn than this hour.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the most solemn time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Learn to look to the Lord in a single way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to know what to do before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be confident, godly, single for service, and without any barrier between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should do all things well in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will have a clear pathway ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all other times, we may be intimate with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, when we come to this meeting, it is not a matter of how well we know each other, for this is the time we truly go before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In ordinary times we talk about brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this time we do not talk about brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the time for us to go to God together to be His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are before God to receive directions together to go out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Learn to solemnly hear God's word before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we do not know God's will, we need to say so, and we should ask, search, learn, and pray before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When our condition is right and the brothers come together, it will be a simple matter without much difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a serious matter for us to go before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Question of Number</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I also want to bring up the matter of number.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there are five, six, seven, or eight co-workers who can coordinate together, then the meeting of the overseers can have twenty to thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need to have more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If there are more, the meeting will be hard to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to set a number for the meeting that we can handle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we can manage three, bring in three.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we can manage ten, bring in ten.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not bring in more people than we can manage.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Learn to know that we are before God as if we were conducting a military council.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This has to be very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may let those who come to learn from out of town go back after two or three months and do their work properly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that one day all of God's children will gradually realize that at least once a week a group of brothers go before God to deal with things on their behalf and on behalf of the whole church.</S>
