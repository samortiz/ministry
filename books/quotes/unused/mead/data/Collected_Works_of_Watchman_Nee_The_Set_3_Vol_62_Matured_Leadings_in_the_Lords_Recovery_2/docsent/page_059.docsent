   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE GOSPEL OF THE CHURCH Date:Evening, March 2, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Witness Lee: Individually or as the church, something is wrong when there is no fruit from our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Church history throughout the past two thousand years shows that as soon as an individual or a church touches God's grace, many people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church in Hong Kong must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we will speak about preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning the preaching of the gospel we have to pay attention to two things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, the church must have the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the whole church must be active in preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL The Power of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Issuing from the Spirit of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our preaching merely stirs up men's emotions or turns men to outward activities, this gospel will never be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to preach the gospel we must have the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the only thing that will bring in the genuine power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>About three years ago I spoke on this subject at a university in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I said that if a young person would open his spirit to the Lord, he would surely receive the spirit of the gospel from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the church must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church must love sinners' souls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is especially true of the young students.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Lord gives you a burden in your spirit, when you see your classmates playing in the field, you should kneel down and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do not preach the gospel, you will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Individually or as the church of God, we must be filled with the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If both the individuals and the church are filled with this gospel spirit, sinners will be saved continually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. L. Moody led over one million people to the Lord on both sides of the Atlantic during his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was a shoemaker, but because he had a love for sinners' souls, he forsook everything for the Lord's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was very burdened for man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once he invited a young girl to his Sunday school meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The girl promised to come but did not show up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A few days later, Moody met her on the street and ran after her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The girl ran into a hotel, closed the doors to one of the rooms, and hid under a bed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Mr. Moody did not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He followed her into the hotel and dragged her out from under the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The girl could not do anything except go to the meeting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Moody died, a co-worker, R. A. Torrey, was on a train.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A lady asked him, "Do you know who I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He answered, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said, "I am the daughter of the little girl who was pulled from under the bed to attend the Sunday school."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another time, Mr. Moody went out in the rain with an umbrella that did not have a top.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many curious ones came around him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the crowd gathered, he began to tell them that God's judgment would come, and nothing that they had would hide them from this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They would all be like a topless umbrella; nothing would keep out the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people were saved through such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people criticize those who are zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They say that zealous ones are mentally unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These ones who criticize are afraid that they will also become "mentally unstable" if they become zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, those who are zealous for the gospel are not mentally unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are pressed by a gospel spirit, and they feel uncomfortable and painful if they do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was saved, I did not have any peace until I preached the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every holiday I would write some gospel tracts and go to the villages to preach the gospel from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At other times, I would preach the gospel to whomever I met.</S>
