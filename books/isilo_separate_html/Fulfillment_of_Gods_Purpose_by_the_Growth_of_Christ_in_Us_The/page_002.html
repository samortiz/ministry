This is why at the beginning of the Bible we are told that God created man in His own image and gave man His dominion, the authority over all things (Gen. 1:26). God created man in His own image with the purpose that man may express Him, and God gave man His dominion over all things that man may conquer the earth and subdue His enemy. Then when we come to the end of the Bible, we see there is a city, and the city is in the appearance of God (Rev. 21:11; cf. 4:3). The city looks the same as God. That is a city of living beings composed together as God's corporate expression, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the composition of all the redeemed ones built together as a corporate body to express God, bearing the very appearance of God. Through that city the earth will be fully conquered and all God's enemies will be subdued. The enemy of God will be put into the lake of fire (20:10). Thus, the Bible concludes with God being fully expressed through His regenerated, transformed, and glorified people, and with His enemy being thoroughly conquered and subdued.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR RELIGIOUS CONCEPT VERSUS GOD'S INTENTION</H2><P>Now we have to see how God can accomplish His purpose. Before we see this, however, I have to point out one thing. Our religious concept always damages God's purpose. This religious concept is that we have to do something to please God by correcting ourselves, adjusting ourselves, and improving ourselves. We think that we have to do many good things in order to please God. This religious concept is very prevailing even today in Christianity. I look to the Lord that we will drop this damaging concept.</P><P>God's purpose is divine and high. No human being can fulfill it. Do you think you can fulfill God's purpose? God's purpose, positively, is to express Himself. How could you express God? It is impossible. God has no intention to ask you to do this good thing or that good thing. It might be good in your eyes, but it is so poor in His eyes.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
