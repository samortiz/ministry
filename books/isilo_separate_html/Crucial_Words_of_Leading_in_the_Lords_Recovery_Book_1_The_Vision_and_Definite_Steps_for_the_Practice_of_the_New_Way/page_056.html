THROUGH THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I hope that the young full-timers would have the understanding that it is a joy to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. Yet we must not think that we have consecrated ourselves to be a spiritual giant with a great name and a large following. The Lord may be gracious to us, and He may make us such a person one day. But surely that is not the way for us to take today. If we want to serve the Lord and work for Him, we should begin from the homes. We should go to people&rsquo;s homes and meet with them in their homes. Since the church is led by the Lord to practice the home meetings, we need to consider the homes as the goal of our work. We must work on the homes. We must not wait for the elders to make the arrangements, nor should we wait for the senior co-workers to take the initiative. Simply pray, &ldquo;Lord, I have to work on the home meetings. I must work on the home meetings.&rdquo; We must not choose only the good homes to work on. The good homes do not need us; to work on them is merely to add more icing on the cake. We need to work on the homes that are not so good, on those who are weak, backslidden, lacking in nourishment, dormant, and even at the brink of denying the Lord&rsquo;s name. We must squeeze our way into these homes. We may not succeed in getting into every one of these homes, but I believe that at the very least we can succeed in getting into one home.</p>
<p>If we work on the home meetings conscientiously, we will learn many lessons. The period in which I learned the most lessons in preaching the gospel and contacting people was during the years around 1940. I spent more time in those years than in other years preaching the gospel. From 1938 to 1943 I preached the gospel very often. In my hometown of Chefoo, on my bicycle I visited both the saints and the unbelievers every day. During these visits, I met people who were possessed by demons, people who were sick, and people who were in all manner of strange conditions, and I dealt with them one by one. From these experiences, I learned many lessons. There is nothing wrong with being trained and receiving spiritual education. But we still should enter into the practice, and we must learn how to deal with people one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW POINTS<br />
CONCERNING OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<p>If the elders, co-workers, and full-timers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will pick up this burden, and if all the churches and all the halls will practice this, that is, to sort out the records and charge the brothers and sisters to take action together, the impact will be tremendous. If we do this, I believe that in three months one-third of the dormant saints will be recovered. If the saints pick up the burden to recover the dormant ones, they themselves will be firmly established and rooted. There will no longer be the need to worry about the saints. We must be clear and firm about this point. We need to labor and strive diligently, and we must be thorough in our endeavor.</p>
<p>Do not despise this kind of practice. Do not think that lofty spiritual theories and deep spiritual principles can be easily applied in practice. Do not think that all we need to do is to go to the homes and stir up people, and that there is not much to this work. If we have these kinds of thoughts, we are very wrong. Do not think that it is a simple thing to stir people up. With some people, we simply cannot do anything with them, yet when another person comes along, he is stirred up. There are secrets, keys, and skills to this. The key is the truth. We must study the truth very much. If we are rich in the truth, our labor will not be in vain, and the chance of failure will be minimized. When others hear our speaking, they will know that we have a high standard of spiritual education. We cannot fake this. Some jobs cannot be done by people with only a junior high education; they require someone with a higher education. In order to carry out our present practice, we need the equipping of the truth.</p>
<p>Before I dropped my job to serve the Lord full time, I was working in a foreign firm. Sometimes the young courier working there could not deliver packages to the customs office or the post office, and he would come back and report this to me. I would rebuke the courier for his inefficiency. Then, since I was the only senior staff member in the office who could speak Chinese, I had to take the courier with me and make the trip again. When I got to the post office, I had to say only a few words and the matter was done. The courier was furious, yet he could not lose his temper in front of the postal clerk. The same was true at the customs office&mdash;what the courier could not accomplish, I was able to complete with only a few words. Why was there a difference? The young courier did not have enough constitution. When others asked him a question, he could not give an answer that was to the point. When he asked others a question, he also could not make his point. However, when I answered people, everything I said was to the point, and things were handled efficiently and properly according to the correct procedure. This was the reason that I could accomplish the task and he could not. I can say the same thing concerning our home meetings. We must be properly equipped. The more we are equipped, the richer the meetings will be.</p>
<p>There are two sides to the present leading in the churches. On the one side, we need to take care of the big meetings. This will take care of those who come only for messages. On the other side, we need to send the meetings to people&rsquo;s homes. We must care for and nourish the dormant ones and the newly saved ones. On the one hand, we need to apply diligence toward people; on the other hand, we need to have the church meetings. With our present church life, we have both sides. We have the big meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the bread-breaking meetings, and the prayer meetings. We also have the small group meetings and the home meetings. All these will take care of the needs of the saints as well as bring in the increase and spread of the church.</p>
<p>To have the home meetings is not simply to break up the big meetings into the homes. We have spent much time to study this topic because the home meetings are the life pulse of the church life. They are the key to the increase and spread of the church. When we promote this matter, I hope we will take it seriously. We must pick up the burden from the Lord and work on it in a practical way. On the one hand, we must pass out the records to the saints and charge them to work on the names. On the other hand, we must encourage them to pray much and to persevere in the patience and love of Christ. As long as we do not lose heart, become discouraged, or beaten down, and as long as we continue to seek out and visit these ones, we will see an abundant harvest.</p>
<p>I also hope that the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones will take the initiative to labor and work with the brothers and sisters and not allow them to do whatever they want. We cannot merely conduct a survey and then invite those who are &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to open their homes to come to meet, but we need to take the initiative to gather the saints and bring the meeting to their homes. Otherwise, some time later the effect will be weakened, and fewer saints will be willing to cooperate. This is an exhausting and laborious job which requires the co-workers and elders to pay undivided attention to promote this.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
