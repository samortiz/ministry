How can we tell that a testament is reliable? We know that many covenants established by many nations are not reliable. Our first need is not to ask what the covenant or a testament has given to us. Our first need is to ask if such a covenant or testament is reliable.</P><P>"For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). The cup is the cup of the new covenant, and the blood is in the new covenant. The new covenant is in the blood of the new covenant. The blood of the new covenant has a wonderful effect, which is to cleanse sins. The direct purpose of the shedding of the Lord Jesus' blood was for the establishing of the covenant. How strange it is that one has to shed his blood to establish a covenant! Why is a covenant only effective when blood is shed? I deeply believe that if every Christian knew that the blood of the Lord Jesus established a covenant, we would not be as bound, restricted, and powerless, and we would not receive only a few answers to prayer and few results in our work as we do today. Brothers and sisters, we have fallen to such a condition because we have put the new covenant aside. We know the term the new covenant, but we have forgotten its use. This is why we have fallen to such a state.</P><P>God established a few covenants in the past. He established a covenant with Noah. He also established a covenant with Abraham. He also established a covenant with Jacob, even though it was not called one explicitly. He also established a covenant with the Israelites who left Egypt. But there is still another covenant which He enacted through the Lord Jesus Christ. There are other covenants besides these. Although there are many covenants, the two most important ones are the one made with Abraham and the new covenant. All the other covenants are less crucial and affect a smaller sphere. The new covenant follows immediately after the covenant God made with Abraham. The new covenant is a further development of the covenant God made with Abraham and inherits what God promised to Abraham. The book of Galatians tells us that the covenant God made with Abraham is the proper covenant, while the covenant of the law was only an insertion between two covenants. Only Abraham's covenant of promise and the new covenant are proper covenants. In between the covenant of promise and the new covenant, another covenant was inserted. This is the so-called "old covenant," or old testament, which lasted for fifteen hundred years. The old testament is not the thirty-nine books that we have which span from Genesis to Malachi. Actually, the proper name of these thirty-nine books is the Holy Scripture. The actual time of the old testament begins from Exodus 19 and ends with the death of the Lord Jesus. Before the old testament or covenant, there was the covenant which God made with Abraham from which the new covenant follows.</P><P>Originally, when man was created, he was well preserved. Because of the fall through sin, there was the action of the conscience, and man walked according to his conscience. But two thousand five hundred years after God created the world, man was still sinning. For this reason, God told Moses to enact a covenant (the law) with man. God promised the Israelites that they would be a royal priesthood, a kingdom of priests. But the condition of the old covenant was bilateral. This is why there were two tablets of the law in the tabernacle. On the one side, the Israelites had to keep the law. On the other side, God would bless them if they kept it. If they could not keep God's law, God would punish them. This is the picture of the old covenant.</P><P>As far as the condition in Eden is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is necessary. As far as the law is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is also necessary. What was the picture of the exile from Eden? It was a loss of position, inheritance, and a loss of life. Man had to labor in the sweat of his face. I always consider sin to be a big minus sign; our body, spiritual life, as well as all that we should have inherited from our Creator were lost because of sin. All these were lost through Adam.</P><P>There was a long period from Adam to Moses. The period from Moses to Christ was also a very long period. From Adam to Moses, death reigned, while from Moses to Christ, not just death reigned, but death and sin reigned. Sin has been present since Adam, and death has been reigning because the result of sin is death. What is death? It is the totality of sin. Sin is like small rivers and streams, while death is like the sea. The general name for the whole period between Adam and Moses is death. Exile, curses, laboring in birth, thorns, pain, and sweat, all point to death. All of these things signify death. The end of these things is death. Death is like the sea into which all the streams and rivers feed.</P><P>This is what we lost in Eden through Adam, and this is what we gained through Adam. We did not lose just a few things; we lost everything. Two thousand five hundred years later, Moses received the covenant of the law from God on Mount Sinai. The covenant said that if man kept the words of the covenant, God would bless him. However, if he could not keep the words of the covenant, God would punish him. What has the law added to us? It has added nothing. Is it an addition? No. This is why death reigned from Adam to Moses, while both death and sin reigned from Moses to Christ. Previously, there was just death. There was sin in addition to death. The law did nothing except expose sin. This was indeed a big minus. Not only was there no blessing, but there was sin and curse as well.</P><P>Before Christ came, man had incurred two great losses. The first loss was through Adam. The second loss was through Moses. These losses have kept man from receiving answers to prayers and have caused man to fail and not overcome. Man was estranged and kept from the enjoyment of God's presence. Man became foolish and ignorant of God. He became weak and unable to enjoy the power of God toward his body and spirit. Man was deprived of all things pertaining to life and godliness. How was the death that was present in the time between Adam and Moses removed? How was the sin that was present in the time between Moses and Christ removed? Today, the blood is the answer to these questions. Some have said that the cross is a big plus sign. Although this is man's saying, it is nevertheless true. The cross of God has added everything to us. From Adam to Moses, all we had was death, and from Moses to Christ, all we had was sin. Now the blood of Christ has terminated everything of Adam, including death, and has terminated everything after Moses that was condemned as sin. Now all our failures before God are removed and nothing is left. Through the shedding of the Lord's blood, we do not have to die anymore, and our sins are cleansed. Originally God was for us, and everything that God had was ours. We were separated from God because of sin and, subsequently, death. God could not help us anymore, and His intended blessings and grace were barred from us. Although we can say that through sin we gained death, what actually happened was that through sin, we lost everything that is of God. We lost everything that God had given, can give, and will give to us. The blood apparently only does a direct work of cleansing us from sin. But actually, the blood recovers our relationship with God. Now what God has given, can give, and will give to us can come to us once more in an unhindered way. The blood adds God to us. The blood of Christ not only accomplished redemption, but accomplished an eternal redemption. Unlike the blood of bulls and goats which only accomplished a temporary redemption, the blood of Christ was shed only once and it accomplished an eternal redemption. The blood of Christ is not like the blood of bulls and goats which men in the Old Testament trusted in. The blood of Christ was shed once. Now sin is gone forever, and the conscience no longer condemns us of sins. This is what the blood of Christ has done. It has completely solved, once for all, the problem of sin. Because the problem of sin is solved, God is added to us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
