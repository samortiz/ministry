   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE TRANSMUTATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The transmutation of the church refers to the church being altered in its organization and administration, that is, in its government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may think that the organization and administration of the church did not change until Constantine accepted Christianity or until the Roman Catholic Church was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is some truth to these concepts both Constantine s acceptance of Christianity and the formation of the Roman Catholic Church resulted in many great changes in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church began prior to these two events.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CLEMENT BRINGING IN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE JEWISH ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we can glean from early church history shows that the transmutation of the church began in the second century with an epistle written by Clement, one of the elders of the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Christian tradition, Clement met both Peter and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wrote a letter known as The Epistle of Clement to the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are spiritual and godly words in this epistle that have helped many people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Clement also mentions the Judaic law with its system of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot say that Clement was the first to bring this system into the church, but his epistle does mention it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that the church was already taking the Jewish religion as a model for the organization and administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church had begun by the time of Clement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IGNATIUS ADVOCATING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THAT OVERSEERS ARE OVER ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Next in the historical sequence is Ignatius, who was very close to Clement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his epistles Ignatius separates the overseers and the elders into two groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Acts 20:17 Paul sent word from Miletus to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 28 says that the Holy Spirit had placed these elders among the flock as overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Elders in verse 17 is equivalent to overseers in verse 28.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders are the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Elder refers to the person, and overseer refers to the function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders are those who are mature in life, and their function is that of overseeing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Paul called for them to come, he referred to them as elders, but when he spoke of their function, he referred to them as overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, elders and overseers are the same group of people; they are not two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ignatius, however, said that overseers, or bishops, should be over elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He made a great mistake in separating the elders and overseers into two groups, making overseers higher than elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This erroneous view had a serious effect on the church, and even today some denominations consider bishops, or overseers, to be higher than elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ignatius s mistaken belief was a seed sown into the church that has had a far-reaching influence on the church throughout the ages; even today this teaching has not been weeded out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the church developed a two-level organization with bishops on top and elders on the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gradually, archbishops and a pope were introduced into this hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CYPRIAN BRINGING IN A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Cyprian, who lived in the middle of the third century, was intelligent, capable, and well-educated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became bishop of Carthage, which was a large and highly cultured city in northern Africa on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time the most cultured city in northern Africa was Alexandria, but Carthage was the second most cultured city in the region.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cyprian used his position and influence to promote the view that the churches, in addition to having an episcopal hierarchy of bishops and elders, should be unified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He separated the saints into various levels according to position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although there was no pope at the time, the bishop of Rome was considered the highest among the bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The other bishops were not controlled by the bishop of Rome, but the consensus was that the bishop of Rome held a slightly higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This notion eventually led to the bishop of Rome becoming the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Cyprian used the term catholic church to refer to the universal church in the sense of one unified church for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was another three or four centuries before the Roman Catholic Church formally came into existence, but the term catholic church was used in the middle of the third century.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By A.D. 260 the organization and administration of the church had completely veered away from the pure condition of the apostolic age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the time of the apostles, the churches had spiritual fellowship with one another without any organizational unity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not control each other; the largest church did not govern the smallest church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Localities were independent and equal before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A local church could be helped by other churches but could not be controlled by them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Cyprian s influence complicated the later church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There were both local churches and district churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There were elders in each local church, bishops overseeing several churches in an area, and great bishops supervising larger districts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the so-called churches were arranged into a unified organization, a catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At this juncture, the organization of the church was completely transmuted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Cyprian s central point was the unification of the church under the control of a unified episcopal system; this was his most serious proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From its inception on the day of Pentecost, the church was united only through the Holy Spirit, without being organized by human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The apostle Peter did not do such a thing, nor did the apostle Paul; none of the apostles used human hands to unify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the age of the apostles, the condition of the church became confused.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Around A.D. 250 Cyprian began to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His behavior was impeccable, and he was educated, talented, humble, and well-liked.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He advocated the unification of the church, arguing that the church could not continue in a scattered, disorderly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to unify the church Cyprian created a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was so autocratic that anyone who did not accept his proposal was excommunicated from his catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many spiritual people at that time rejected Cyprian s proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The strongest of these opponents was Novatian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Novatian genuinely knew the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was a contemporary of Cyprian who pointed out that it was an error to unify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Novatian said that the church should be as it was in the apostolic age, without any unifying organization.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Cyprian requested that the catholic churches excommunicate Novatian and his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many people stood with Novatian as a good testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not all the believers supported the transmutation of the church; many people did not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, we are not the first to recognize that the church should not have a unified organization; in the third century, as the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church was occurring, some of God s children rose up to oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The transmutation of the church in administration and organization began with Clement.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Satan used him to bring the Old Testament priestly system into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The transmutation reached its peak in the middle of the third century when Cyprian became bishop of Carthage.</S>
