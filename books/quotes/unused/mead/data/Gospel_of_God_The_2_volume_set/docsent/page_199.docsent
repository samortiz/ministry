   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST OF NONE EFFECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING DIFFERENT FROM SEPARATION FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One thing more we have to know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the original language the word "brought to nought" is katargeo.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a passive verb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a little of the sense of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Kata has somewhat the sense of detachment, but the sense is not very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word katargeo means to be led away from the effect and the function.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Stephan's lexicon of Greek words can be considered as one of the best.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It tells us that the word here means to be led away from the function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One must see the difference between separation from Christ and being led away from the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a man has left Christ and is separated from Him, then everything is through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this is not what Paul was saying here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said that if they keep the law, they have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they want to hold on to the law, they have to let go of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they follow the law, they will lose the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the effect of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the effect of Christ is manifested in me, I can rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Though I may be weak and worthless, I know that His grace is sufficient for me, and my heart is able to be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This joy and peace that I have in my heart is the effect of Christ on me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is Christ working out His effect on me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not try to be saved by my works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I know that I am saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not have to strive to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not have to plead desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nor do I have to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can rest in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today many Christians have turned away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ does not have much effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose I owe someone a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I cannot repay it even if I were to sell all that I have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I have a best friend.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He says that since I am so heavily in debt, he will write a check for me so that I can clear my debts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I am a lazy man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am too lazy to cash the check.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now do I have money at home?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do, but I also have a debt at home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have the check, but the check has no effect on me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The debt is still there; it has not been repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am still bearing the burden of the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today God has given us the check already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we have not cashed in on the effect of this check.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, to be separated from Christ and to have Christ made of none effect on us are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be separated from Christ is to be not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we can never be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 8 tells us that there is no way for us to be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It says that no one can separate us from the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The grace we receive from Christ and the blessing we have from God are ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can overturn them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They cannot be overturned, because they are based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through the many things that Christ has accomplished for us, the problem of eternal life and death is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no way to overturn this, for this is based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But on the subjective side, the absence of peace in the heart and the continual presence of unhappiness is a Christian problem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A man may worry about how he can receive grace and how he can preserve his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day his heart is held in suspense, not knowing what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a man has turned away from the effect of Christ, he will not receive the effect he should receive from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, Galatians 5:4 shows us that for a man to pursue after law is for him to fall from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he falls from grace, he is away from the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, this does not refer to man's losing his salvation after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, it refers to one's not having the joy and peace of salvation.</S>
