   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THOUGHTS AND SUBMISSION Date: Morning, July 6, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we want to continue our discussion with 2 Corinthians 10:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every high thing is translated "edifices" by Henry Alford.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means tall buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is used to describe structures, edifices, erected in one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word thought is noema in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is used six times in the New Testament: once in Philippians and five times in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Corinthians 2:11 it is translated as schemes, and in 3:14, 4:4, 10:5, and 11:3 it is rendered thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It carries more of an idea of volition than of mental activity, and it can alternatively be translated as "purpose in the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TAKING CAPTIVE THE THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that the high things in man are strongholds; they are the things that hinder a man from knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, an unbeliever has many excuses; these are his strongholds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time he is asked to believe in the Lord, he turns to these excuses to protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He says that he is busy or that he has prior engagements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are reasons which a man uses to fence himself in, reasons by which he rejects God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are actually the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should note, however, that these verses refer to believers who have been taken captive in their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the high things that hinder a man from knowing God must be overthrown before his thoughts can be taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To take captive means to capture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God overthrows our strongholds for the purpose of capturing our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the only way that we can come to the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By nature, man's thoughts are free; they operate according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they are left to themselves, they will never come to the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our thoughts must be made a slave before they can serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our thoughts represent our existence as an independent person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind first judges certain things to be good, thinks about them, and finally makes decisions based upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our proposals and decisions represent our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to maintain our personal freedom, we have to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to preserve ourselves and justify our decisions and ideas as being superior, we surround ourselves with many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to maintain that our way is right, and we provide reasons to justify why we forbid anyone to touch our decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We fortify ourselves with all kinds of reasons, like village folks who protect their hamlets with barracks and fortifications.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what happens when a man's thoughts are surrounded by strongholds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yesterday I said that a servant of God must not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone who wants to serve the Lord must have his eyes opened to Romans 9; he must experience this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not enough to stop one's speaking or reasonings; his thoughts must be taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The mouth has to be stopped, and reasons have to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>More than this, the thoughts have to be taken captive and stripped of all ideas and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The stopping of one's mouth is merely a superficial dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Inwardly one has to deal with reasons and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man must have reasons overthrown and thoughts captured before he can be brought to the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy to spot those who can submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not hard to identify those who have touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who have touched authority and who practice genuine submission are bridled in their tongues; they do not have many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither do they propose many things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who have not touched authority always try to fortify their own thoughts with reasons and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A day will come when a man's thoughts are taken captive; they will be "kidnapped."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That will be the day when he is brought to the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people like to be God's counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They want God to listen to them and take their advice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They think they can draft God's blueprints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wherever the ones whose thoughts are not captured go, they want to make improvements instead of live out submission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their favorite expression is, "To me, this is wrong, and that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to do this and that."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Their thoughts and reasonings are never held in check, and they can never be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to be dealt with to the point that our thoughts are captured.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our proposals must be dealt with before we can see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are full of self-ideas and self-proposals, we do not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are two omniscient beings in this universe God and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We want to be men's counselor, and we also want to be God's counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to change everything around wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It seems as if we know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This clearly shows that our thoughts are not captured; we still do not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Obeying Christ means to be under authority, to stop all proposals, and to lose all interest in making proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should become persons without any conception; our only desire should be to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who have touched God's authority have no desire to make proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They only care to obey.</S>
