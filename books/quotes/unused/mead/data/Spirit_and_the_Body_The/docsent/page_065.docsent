   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we saw in the book of Ephesians four main aspects of the Body: that the Body comes into existence through the transmission of Christ; that the Body has been brought forth through the abolishing of all the ordinances; that the Body is a matter of our being joint-heirs and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ; and that the Body is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words "one body and one Spirit" indicate that the Body of Christ is wholly a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have the Spirit, we have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall see further, from 1 Corinthians 12, that the Body is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 12 the Body is covered in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CONCERNING BEING SPIRITUAL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many translators are troubled by 1 Corinthians 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the King James Version, this verse says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse the Apostle Paul uses the adjective form of the word pneuma, which means spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some translations have added the word "gifts" after "spiritual" to make it read, "Concerning spiritual gifts."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this is not altogether accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Paul had meant this, he would have added the word "gifts."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other translations say, "Concerning spiritual matters."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is better than "spiritual gifts," for when you use the word "gifts," you limit the matter to the realm of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, "spiritual matters" implies a larger realm, a broader scope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It includes not only gifts, but also other spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I prefer the rendering, "Concerning being spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that this was Paul's meaning in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's meaning was that we all need to be spiritual, to be in the condition of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is possible to have the Spirit, but not to be spiritual at a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being spiritual is a practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But suppose when we come together as the Body, we come in a way that is careless, loose, and sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we all were like this, where would the Body be?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Practically speaking, there would be no Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body would be there doctrinally, but not practically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, suppose when we gather together everyone is filled with the Spirit, bubbling, and saying, "O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jesus Christ is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, I'm so happy this morning!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have something to share of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is an illustration of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we come together as members of the Body, we must be spiritual in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But suppose no one prays, calls on the Lord, or stands up to give a word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In such a case we would not be spiritual in a practical way in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Paul was writing this chapter, he realized that when Christians gather together they need to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we are spiritual, the gifts will be manifested, and many things will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are practically spiritual in the meetings of the church, both the spiritual gifts and other spiritual matters will be evident.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way we shall have the Body in a practical way.</S>
