   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD EXPRESSED IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the second point of this first major step of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the incarnation of Christ, God is expressed in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is contrary to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We always think it would be wonderful if God would manifest Himself directly to us, but this is not His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's plan is to manifest Himself in man and through man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the key to the four Gospels: God is expressed in a man a man who is truly man, a man who lived a human life on this earth, yet who expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Gospel of John we are told that the Lord is the Word of God, that this Word is God Himself John 1:1 , and that one day He became a man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We see the Lord on this earth acting, living, walking, working, and doing things exactly as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although He performed miracles, His life was a human life, His walk a human walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes He was hungry, sometimes thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once He asked a woman for some water to drink John 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes He felt tired John 4:6 , and sometimes He even wept John 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was one hundred percent a man!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet, in this man in His life, His walk, His work God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what God still desires today; He desires to be manifested through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you realize that Christians should be very human?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was young, soon after I was saved, I had a wonderful thought: I thought the more different I was from others, the more spiritual I would be!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But one day the Lord opened my eyes and caused me to see that what I was considering was not spiritual, but peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not peculiarity that must be manifested through me, but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I must be filled with God and possessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then I will manifest God in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I must be very human, yet very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today some people think that to make themselves peculiar and different from others is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No, the more spiritual we are, the more ordinary we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>About twenty-two years ago we were living and working in a certain city in North China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time many of us were seeking to grow in love to the Lord and be more spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the sisters were influenced by certain writings; so they tried to imitate what the books taught.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They tried to be quiet, they tried to be gentle, they tried to do things slowly and speak softly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But after a short time, I found that this was not spirituality, but altogether imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was imitation without life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day I talked with these sisters and said, "Sisters, if you would be spiritual, you must move quickly, speak quickly, and seek never to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If one of you lose your temper, then you will be spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They exclaimed, "Oh, Brother Lee, you are really too much for us!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We go to one extreme, and you want us to go to the other."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then I asked them where they should be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They answered, "Neither at one extreme nor the other.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be in the middle, we must be balanced."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be spiritual is not to be quiet and gentle; neither is it to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be spiritual is simply to be occupied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must realize what kind of life God desires us to have.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not just a life of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a life full of Christ, occupied by God and mingled with God in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our Lord was on earth, though He was wholly a man, He lived by God John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He never did anything of Himself John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 8:28 ; He never spoke anything from Himself John 7:16-17; 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our Lord had no sin; He did not have a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From a natural point of view, He did not even know what sin was 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet He denied and rejected Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He always took God as His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He walked in God, worked through God, and spoke only from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the life which God desires us to have.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Christian life is to have God in Christ as our life and our all, day by day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must deny and reject ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to abandon ourselves and take God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not just a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a life!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a life of taking God practically, moment by moment, as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ was what we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the Head, and we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has done the most wonderful thing in the universe in mingling Himself with a man, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God did not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is going onward, doing the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is mingling Himself with thousands upon thousands of people!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the past two thousand years He has been doing this, but man has simply not understood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God wants to mingle Himself with us, but we have not cooperated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In these two centuries, there have been many Christian teachings, but something has been lacking the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, may we realize that in Christ God desires to be our life and our everything, even as He was everything to Christ.</S>
