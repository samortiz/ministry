<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE GOSPEL<br />
IN ROMANS THROUGH REVELATION</h2>
<p>After the Acts, there are four main ministers in the New Testament: Paul, James, Peter, and John. The books from Romans to Revelation were written by these four plus Jude. In the ministry of Paul, James, Peter, and John life is the central point of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Generating Life in the Writings of Paul</h2>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s writings there are many verses that speak of the generating life. Ephesians 2:5 says, &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ.&rdquo; This refers to our regeneration by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Similarly, Titus 3:5 says, &ldquo;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&rdquo; In addition, 1 Corinthians 4:15 says, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.&rdquo; This shows us that when a person truly preaches the gospel to others, he is begetting them. I am stressing these matters because I would like to make it clear that in the early days, when the apostles went out to preach the gospel, their thought and intention was to beget people, that is, to impart life to them that they could be regenerated.</p>
<p>Romans 5:17 and 18 say, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.&rdquo; Justification is not for itself; it is for life to be given to us, and through righteousness by justification we can reign in life. Romans 6:4 says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.&rdquo; To walk in newness of life means that we have received life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Brought Forth by the Word of Truth<br />
in James</h2>
<p>The writings of James comprise only one book. James 1:18 speaks of regeneration, saying, &ldquo;He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&rdquo; Expositors speak much about this book, but they mostly neglect this verse that tells us that God begot us, regenerated us, by the word of truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Regeneration as the New Birth<br />
in the Writings of Peter</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; Similarly, 2:2 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo; <em>Newborn babes</em> implies regeneration as the new birth, which Peter stresses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Preaching of the Eternal Life<br />
in the Writings of John</h2>
<p>As we know, John 3:3, 5, and 6 speak of being born again. In addition, 1 John 1:1 through 3 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The apostles preached the eternal life which they had heard, seen, and handled. Verses 11 through 13 of chapter five say, &ldquo;And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; This also shows us that the ministry in the early days was a ministry of life. The preaching, teaching, and ministry of the apostles was to preach life, teach life, and minister life.</p>
