<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Related to the Archangel Michael's<br>Standing for Israel</H2><P>The vision concerning the destiny of Israel in chapter twelve is related to the archangel Michael's standing for Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Things in the Consummation of the Age</H2><P>First, Daniel 12 speaks of things in the consummation of the age (Matt. 28:20b)&#151;the last three and a half years of the present age (Dan. 12:7; 7:25b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Michael Standing for Israel</H2><P>At that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of Israel, will arise (12:1a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. A Time of Distress</H2><P>There will be a time of distress (great tribulation) such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time (12:1b; Matt. 24:21; Jer. 30:7a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Shattering of the Power<br>of the Holy People Being Completed</H2><P>During this time of distress and tribulation, the shattering of the power of the holy people will be completed (Dan. 12:7b; 7:25b; Rev. 13:5, 7a; 11:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Everyone Found Written<br>in the Book Being Delivered</H2><P>Daniel 12:1c tells us that the people of Israel, everyone found written in the book, will be delivered. Those found written in the book are those whose names are written in God's book of life. The few children of Israel who will be delivered out of the hand of Antichrist will see Christ descending in the air and will repent, receive Him, and be saved.</P>
