They reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
32 For John came to you in the way of 1righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him
John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness
42 Jesus said to them Have you never read in the Scriptures The 1stone which the 1builders rejected this has become the 2head of the corner
331 The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem , and the vinedressers are the leaders of the Israelites

Another parable was needed for Him to illustrate how the kingdom people, who are in the kingdom of the heavens, will be dealt with strictly
41 Both the oxen and the fatted cattle refer to Christ, who was killed so that God's chosen people could enjoy Him as a feast
The Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics
3 Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them

The fringes signified that their conduct was regulated by the heavenly rule and they were to be a reminder to them to keep Gods commandments
How often 1I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!
It had been the house of God, but now it was called 'your house' because the Jews had made it a den of robbers

The Lord's word here is brief, but it includes a number of things from the destruction of Jerusalem until the Lord's second coming
As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today
Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea
He made clear that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again
1 And Jesus came out 1from the 2temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the 2temple
3 And as He sat on the 1Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, 2When will these things be?
31 To receive the vision of the Lord's prophecy concerning this age, we need to climb the high mountain to enter into His presence
At the time of the great tribulation, which will be the consummation, the end, of this age, the prophecy will be fully fulfilled
7 For 1nation will rise up against nation, and 1kingdom against kingdom; and there will be 2famines and 3earthquakes in various places
9 Then they will deliver 1you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name
62 The end denotes the consummation of this age , which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation
73 Since Christ's ascension, earthquakes have been occurring throughout all the centuries and will be intensified at the end of this age
The birth pangs here are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord's sake, whereas the travailing in birth in Rev
12:2 refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God's people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament
That preaching, signified by the white horse of the first seal in Revelation 6:1-2, will be a sign of the consummation of this age
22 And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the 1chosen, those days will be cut short
24 For 1false Christs and 2false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the chosen
9:27, which will begin with the setting up of Antichrist's image in the temple and will end with Christ's open coming
It refers to Antichrist's image, which will be set up as an idol in the temple of God at the beginning of the great tribulation
The mentioning of the Sabbath here indicates that the Jews would still keep the Sabbath after the restoration of the nation of Israel
The great tribulation spoken of here will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference, whereas the trial mentioned in Rev
They need to be warned that Messiah, the Christ, will not arise here or there on earth but will descend from heaven on the cloud
27 For just as the 1lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be
The lightning here signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation , whereas the thief's coming in v
292 This supernatural calamity will occur in heaven after the great tribulation, at the close of the end of this age
39 And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be
In this portion of the Word everything spoken by the Lord is related to two matters watchfulness and readiness and faithfulness and prudence
The believers however should be dedrugged and should soberly know that Christ is coming to execute Gods judgment upon this corrupted world
Because of man's lust Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God's interest
Householder refers to the believer, and house to the conduct and work that a believer has built up in his Christian life
Although the believers should not be befuddled by the necessities of this life, they need to work for a living
45 Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?
In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions
The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming, but that he does not expect Him
It was a custom for Greek and Roman actors to wear large masks with mechanical devices that increased the force of their voice
The prophecy of the kingdom given on the Mount of Olives is a continuation of the Lord's declaration regarding His forsaking of Israel
In chapter twenty-four watchfulness and readiness are covered in verses 32 through 44, and faithfulness and prudence in verses 45 through 51
1 At that time the 1kingdom of the heavens will be likened to 2ten 3virgins, who took their 4lamps and 5went forth to meet the 6bridegroom
In chapter twenty-five there is the need of a complementary word for each aspect covered in chapter twenty-four
9 But the prudent answered saying Perhaps there will 1not be enough for us and for you go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves
10 And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast
1 refers to meeting someone alone and in secret, whereas the word here refers to meeting someone openly according to plan and ceremony
81 This word implies that even after they are resurrected, the foolish believers will still need the filling of the Holy Spirit
82 Going out proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins were lighted; they contained some oil but did not have an adequate supply
Those who sell oil must be the two witnesses who appear during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil
14 For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a 1man about to go 1abroad, who called his own 2slaves and delivered to them 3his possessions
15 To one he gave five 1talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his 2own ability
In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God , whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts
162 Gained another five signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste
Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord
183 Hid his master's money signifies rendering the Lord's gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses
A long time signifies the entire church age, and came signifies the Lord's descending to the air in His coming
The one-talented one also, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, came to the judgment seat of Christ in the air
The best way to use your talent is to take care of others, to become interested in others and concerned for them
31 But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory
At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles
His glory comprises the glory of His divinity , the glory of His humanity , the glory of His resurrection , and the glory of His ascension
37 Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?
The 'goats' will perish in the lake of fire, after Antichrist and the false prophet and before the devil and the resurrected sinners
If any man follows the devil in opposing the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the devil and the fallen angels
The Lord will then judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel
The prophecy concerning the kingdom given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives concerns God's economy to bring in His kingdom
The nation of Israel is like a woman in travail to deliver the remnant of Jews who will be the priests during the millennium
The believers, covered in the second section of this prophecy, will be the kings, and the citizens will be taken from among the nations
We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: life and service
To have the Spirit in our soul means that we grow in life, are transformed, and have our soul saturated with the Holy Spirit of God
The man in verse 14 signifies Christ, who was going abroad, that is, into the heavens, and delivered His possessions to His slaves
We must diligently seek the gospel and the truth, experience the truth concerning the church, and have a heart to care for the saints
He cares only that the one talent is multiplied into two, two talents are multiplied into four, and five talents are multiplied into ten
2 You know that after two days the 1Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being delivered up to be crucified

In the type, during the four days preceding the day of the Passover, the Passover lamb had to be examined in relation to its perfection

121 Mary received the revelation of the Lord's death through the Lord's words in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and v
131 In the foregoing verse the Lord spoke of His burial, implying His death and resurrection, accomplished for our redemption
Along with Simon, Mary also probably thought that this was her last chance to do something over the Lord's body to anoint Him for burial
26 And as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is My body
After Judas had gone, Thus, Judas participated in the Passover feast, but he did not partake of the Lord's table
By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ , which also is signified by the bread of the table
Concerning the Lord's table , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing
In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion
Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us
What was Matthew's main intention in 26:31-75-to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter?
In the light of the contrast between Christ's victory and Peter's failure, let us now consider verses 31 through 75

741 In his first denial Peter spoke words only ; in his second denial he replied with an oath ; in his third denial he cursed and swore
Throughout chapter twenty-six, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God
Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life
Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life
His death was not a matter of compulsion, but a voluntary fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning His crucifixion
The chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him
When we see the bread at the Lord's table, we need to realize that it is a symbol both of the Lord's physical body and His mystical Body
Concerning the Lord's table , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing
The product of the vine within the cup of the Lord's table also is a symbol, signifying the Lord's blood shed on the cross for our sins
The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God
Following the establishing of the table, the Lord warned the disciples that they all would be stumbled because of Him
Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life
Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life
1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death
In 27:19 Pilate's wife referred to the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and in verse 24 Pilate himself called Him a righteous man
It is very meaningful that Matthew inserted the record of the destiny of Judas into his account of Pilate's judgment of Christ
In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them
When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, 'We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God
In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it
Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die
In the evil conspiracy the Jewish religionists convinced the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus

5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
In all of human history there has not been a case in which man's unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ
No earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
The Christ who exposed man's unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed
