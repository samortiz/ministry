   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Issue No. 22 THE WIND BLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day by a river, a man was angrily tearing apart a tract that another person had given to him, and he was throwing it into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The amazing thing was that the wind blew a piece of the shredded paper back into his sleeve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The torn piece had only one word: "Eternity."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The man was immediately reminded by the word, and he was awakened to his own ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It turned him to "seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near" Isa 55:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Indeed, "the wind blows where it wills" John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE VICTORY THROUGH THE DEFEAT OF AN AGNOSTIC</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A certain man was an educated and polite person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet he was an agnostic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever he felt in his heart, he would not show it outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He traveled to many places and visited many of his relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among one of his relatives was his widowed aunt who was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She invited this man to her house very often, and she was grieved about his attitude toward the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I received an invitation card from her to speak with her nephew over dinner about his unbelieving concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She and her daughters had debated this matter with him already, and the poor women were not able to answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I gladly went.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the table this man sat opposite to me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Soon, he looked at me with a smile and said, "Do you believe in the story of the flood?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I said, "I believe in every word of it."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "In this matter, your God shows that He is a demon that destroys humanity."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I said, "On the contrary, He was saving men by destroying them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves His wisdom and His goodness."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "You can never convince me in this matter."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I said, "Don't say such a thing with too much assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you observe that I have a deadly disease in my arm and you tell me to have my arm cut off, would you say that you are doing what a demon does?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proportion of the number of men at the time of flood to the whole of humanity is much smaller than the size of the arm to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The difference in the spiritual sphere does not change the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, in order to cut off an arm, a person must cut off the hand and the fingers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a man corrupts himself, he corrupts his family as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Take the example of a drunkard: the arm can be likened to the man, the hand can be likened to the wife, and the fingers, to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you a demon just because you cut off my arm?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He answered, "Certainly not."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said, "What more then can you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He humbly acknowledged his defeat, yet followed immediately by saying, "If you believe in the foreknowledge of God concerning man's suffering, you can never justify God's act in His creation of man."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I said, "You are wrong again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This act has to do with His gift of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It proves God's goodness and wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "This is impossible."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said, "Not so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose we are twins, and our father promises that when we grow up, he will give us fifty thousand pounds each.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose he knows beforehand that I will waste my portion and that you will increase your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Should the fact that I will bring loss to myself cause you to be deprived of your joy?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One cannot do this."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I said, "In this matter, you have to acknowledge that God's goodness and wisdom are manifested in the creation of man."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He began to show admiration and awakening, and he readily acknowledged my argument.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But he insisted that it was wrong that man should be given a free will, and that such an act was indefensible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I said, "This is again something that manifests God's goodness and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You are an unmarried man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose you are to be married, and you have to choose between two women.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One of them does not have any will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other has a will, but in everything she is contrary to your will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Which of the two would you choose?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "Of course, the one with a will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The other must be a piece of clay!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the lady relatives applauded and were happy at his judgment, and the doctor did not say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later, we became good friends, and he was no longer an agnostic.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He openly confessed that he believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and he matched his faith by his Christian deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Issue No. 24 GOD USING THE HUMBLE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One town in our province was famous for being evil.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The tide of sin swept through that place, and the small number of Christians there felt unable to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One summer there was an evangelistic tent meeting nearby.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Among the repentant ones was an illiterate called "the Fool."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He attended the meeting out of curiosity, but was wonderfully saved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When he returned to his sin-ridden town, his heart was pounding within him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He went from house to house and went in without knocking, threatening the people with a loud voice: "What will you do when eternity comes?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did his best from street to street.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said nothing else except, "When eternity comes, what are you going to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The arrows of condemnation were shooting fast and quick.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The people were reminded of God and were sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The few Christians in that town were encouraged by their newly converted comrade, and they came alive.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They invited a preacher to their town, and following that, there was a great revival and much reaping of souls.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As the preacher recalled it, the filthy, sinful society was renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A church was built, and a great congregation with a Sunday school was established.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All these things happened because of one heavenly messenger who came with the word, "When eternity comes, what will you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This resulted in waking everyone out of his dreams.</S>
