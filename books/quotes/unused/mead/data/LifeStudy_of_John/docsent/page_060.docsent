   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Five Signifying Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The number five signifies responsibility, the responsibility of Christ in feeding us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The number five is composed of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The number four represents the creatures Rev 4:6 , and the number one represents the Creator 1 Cor 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Creator and the creatures added together take responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The number five is not composed of three plus two, but of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Look at your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is composed of four fingers and a thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would be very awkward if your hand had three fingers and two thumbs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Four fingers with one thumb enable the hand to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The five barley loaves signify that the Lord as the Creator one added to the creatures four bears the responsibility to feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His humanity, the resurrected Christ bears this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>F. Two Fishes Signifying</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>the Redeeming Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>of Christ s Life</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The two fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the redeeming life, He lives in the sea, the Satan-corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The barley comes out of the land, representing the earth created by God, while the fishes come out of the sea, signifying the world corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus came not only to the earth created by God, but also to the world corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He had come only to the earth created by God, He would only have been represented by the barley loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But since He also came into the world corrupted by Satan, He is also represented by the two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He had nothing to do with the corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as fish are not salty though they live in salt water, so the Lord was not corrupted by Satan though He lived in the Satan-corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is like the fish that can live in the salty environment of the sea without being salted by it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But yet He was sinless, unaffected by the sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the generating life, Christ lived as a proper man in the God-created earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the redeeming life, Christ lived in the Satan-corrupted world without being affected by its corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The number two means testimony Rev 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two fishes are a testimony that Christ is sufficient to bear responsibility in feeding us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that barley, which is of the vegetable life, represents the generating life and that the fish, which are of the animal life, represent the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must ask, if the human race had never fallen, would Christ as our regenerating life still have been necessary?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the fall of Adam, God put him in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tree of life has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, man must take God as his life by eating the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even John 12:24 states that the Lord was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died, after which He was raised up to become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This too had nothing to do with sin, for, according to the Scriptures, the vegetable life is to produce or to generate much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The one grain of wheat bears many other grains.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, it represents the generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, before man fell, he ate only of the vegetable life Gen 1:29 , but after he fell, he also ate of the animal life Gen 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the fall there was no need for the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after man fell he needed the animal life because redemption requires the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The vegetable life was sufficient before man sinned, but after he sinned the animal life became necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The offerings in the Old Testament always had both the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the Passover had the slain lamb, which represented the animal life, and the unleavened bread, which represented the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two different lives are necessary in order to meet all of our need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Also, the meat offerings of Leviticus were accompanied with the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The meal offerings were made of fine flour, vegetable oil, and frankincense items of the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Leviticus, the meal offerings could never be accepted without the meat offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That was exactly what Cain did.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only offered vegetables to God and was rejected, while his brother Abel offered the sacrifice of an animal whose blood had been shed and was accepted Gen 4:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the Lord Jesus to be both our generating life and our redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By His death on the cross two things came out of Him the blood to redeem us and the water to generate us John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His shed blood brought redemption to us, and the water from His wounded side imparted His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The five barley loaves were accompanied by the two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is impossible for barley to shed blood; therefore, it could never redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The two fishes represent the animal life for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord is represented by both the barley loaves and the fishes, for He is our vegetable life to generate us and our animal life to redeem us.</S>
