   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sin Reigning unto Death, and Death Reigning through the Sinner, Causing Him to Lose All His Rights</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sin reigns unto death, and death reigns through the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, when a couple argues, the man becomes the male king and the woman becomes the female king.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only have they become kings in their voices, eyes, and eyelashes, even every hair on their body becomes a king.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole family becomes a band of rebellious kings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the end of the argument, they do not want to live anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is all due to the reigning of sin and death, which cause a sinner to lose all his rights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Grace Reigning through Righteousness unto Eternal Life, and Eternal Life through Jesus Christ Causing the Believers to Reign</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all know that grace is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But grace does not have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, grace reigns through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God gives us grace, and He also gives us righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we have both grace and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace reigns through righteousness, that is, through God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result is that man obtains eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This eternal life causes the believers to reign through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 5:21 says, "So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the end, we the believers will reign in this eternal life through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Bringing in God's Kingship</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When married brothers and sisters are about to clash and argue with each other, they have to declare that they are reigning through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have to declare that they will not argue anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will bring in God's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a family, when the parents argue all the time, the children will become disobedient, and the whole family will be in a situation of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This family will lose the grace and right to God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is true with a family is also true with a church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not consider arguments as light matters; arguments are rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Arguments with proper reasons are rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Arguments without proper reasons are also rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What then is obedience?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Obedience is to not argue and to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because I submit to the authority of the head, all my hair, tongue, lips, and teeth submit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not argue anymore, and I reign.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This brings in God's kingship which expands to become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Expanding to Be the Kingdom of God, Which Is the Increase of Christ as the Seed of God's Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingship that is brought in as a result of our reigning in life is the expansion of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When your companion or your spouse is arguing, and you refrain from doing the same, you are allowing Christ to reign within, and He is expanding within you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Mark 4 and Matthew 13, the kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus as the seed of life sown into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This seed will develop until it becomes a sphere which is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kingdom will expand until the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the end of the Gentile rule, we will have the condition described in Daniel 2 concerning the great image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The stone cut out without hands is the Lord Jesus v. 34 . He will come down from heaven, smite the image, and break it into pieces v. 35 . The stone will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth 2:31-35 . The great mountain is the expansion of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all hope that the Lord Jesus will come back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we need to allow Him to expand His kingship in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more He expands in the believers, the sooner He will return.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether He will come back sooner or not depends on whether we allow Him to expand in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the kingdom of God.</S>
