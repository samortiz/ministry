<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. LESSONS OF SAMUEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being Faithful<br>in All His Statuses and Offices</H2><P>Samuel was faithful in all his statuses and offices. As a Levite, he served God his whole life. As a Nazarite, he kept his consecration without failure. As a priest-prophet, he spoke for God honestly and initiated the prophethood to replace the fading priesthood in the divine revelation. As a judge, he was faithful to God and just to the people, terminating the judgeship and bringing in the kingship for the changing of the age in the fulfillment of God's economy on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Enjoying His Portion<br>of the Good Land to the Fullest<br>for His Whole Life</H2><P>Samuel enjoyed his portion of the good land to the fullest for his whole life. He was therefore a person who enjoyed the God-allotted portion of the promised good land, that is, Christ. There was no defect in his enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Only Defect in His History<br>Being His Appointing His Two Sons<br>as Judges among the Children of Israel</H2><P>The only defect in Samuel's history was that he appointed his two sons as judges among the children of Israel. His sons did not follow in his ways, and this gave cause for the children of Israel to ask for a king (8:1-7). Humanly speaking, Samuel made a mistake in this matter, but this mistake helped God to manage the situation among His people for the fulfillment of His economy.</P>
