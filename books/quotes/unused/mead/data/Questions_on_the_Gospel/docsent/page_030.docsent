   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-ONE CONCERNING RESURRECTION AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the cross Christ said, "It is finished," indicating that the work of the cross was complete.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why then could we still not be saved if He had not resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ said, "It is finished," on the cross, it meant that redemption was finished; it did not mean that salvation was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption, the objective aspect, was accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Salvation, the subjective aspect, is accomplished only when we are personally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our joining to Christ in the subjective aspect involves a union with Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, if He had not resurrected, we could not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Notice that this verse speaks of being freed from two laws, the law of sin and the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The death of Christ dealt with sin; whereas, the resurrection of Christ dealt with death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ did away with sin through His death and nullified death through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's death only solved the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ's resurrection solved the problem of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not only sinful people but also dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord died on the cross to save us from being in the position of sinners, and He resurrected to save us from being in the position of dead men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord had not died on the cross, we would be both sinful and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Lord had only died without being resurrected, we would no longer be sinners, but we would still remain dead men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Resurrection destroys the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death satisfies God; it takes care of the objective need and deals with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Resurrection satisfies us; it takes care of the subjective need and gives life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we only preach Christ's death, without preaching His resurrection, we are preaching only one half of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reading the book of Acts, we see that the apostles paid a great deal of attention to the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood is spoken of more than four hundred times in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood was brought before God to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this happened after resurrection Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While the Lord's death must be heeded, it cannot be separated from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Death was followed by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without resurrection there can be no salvation, because we are regenerated by God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible is full of the truth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament and the Old Testament are filled with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham offered up Isaac because he believed in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Israelites' crossing of the Jordan River and the budding of Aaron's rod typify resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 15:3 and 4 say, "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Scriptures in this verse refer to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that both the death and resurrection of Christ are according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We praise and thank God that His Son not only died for us but was also resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He dealt not only with the law of sin but also with the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He saves us not only from being in the position of sinners but also from being in the position of dead men.</S>
