<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
KNOWING THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: August 25, 1961</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to speak about leading the young people in matters related to spiritual life. The practical experience of life is related to the cross, and it involves primarily accepting the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT IS OF MAN NEEDING<br />
TO BE TERMINATED BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>The most important meaning of the cross is termination. We must stress the point to the young people that in the eyes of God, everything of man must be terminated. This includes not only the evil things but also the good things in man. Whatever comes out of man must be terminated. A Christian&rsquo;s experience of life is entirely different from the world&rsquo;s cultivation of ethics. Ethical cultivation tries to nurture the element of good within man and to restrict the element of evil in him. A Christian&rsquo;s experience of life, or we may say a Christian&rsquo;s practical living, is totally different. The practical living of a Christian is to live Christ. The experience of the life of a Christian is to experience Christ. Hence, in order for us to experience Christ, we must be terminated. As long as anything of ourselves remains, Christ cannot be expressed through us. In order to live out Christ, we must be terminated. Hence, Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; We are crucified, terminated, and it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. When it is no longer we who live, Christ can live out of us. This word shows that the practical living of a Christian involves Christ living His life in us, not us living our life. In order for Christ to live in us, we must be terminated; thankfully, we have already been terminated through our crucifixion with Christ.</p>
<p>There are several portions in the New Testament that clearly refer to the matter of our termination. In addition to Galatians 2:20, Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Therefore, we must see that we have been terminated before God. Both what is good and what is evil in us have been terminated; not only the aspect of our nature that commits sin but also the aspect of our nature that desires to do good deeds have been terminated; not only our hatred but also our love have been terminated; not only our pride but also our humility have been terminated. Now all that we are and all that we have must be crucified in our experience because everything has been crucified with Christ in reality.</p>
<p>Most Christians, especially the young people, know little of this matter; hence, the more we stress this point, the better it will be for them. The matter we should stress is that in order to have the reality of the Christian life, we must accept the cross. In order to accept the cross, however, we must realize that all we are and all we have must be terminated and that this is possible because God has already terminated us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE CROSS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the First Ministry<br />
in the New Testament&mdash;<br />
Burying People</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist was sent by God to lead people to repent (Matt. 3:1-2). When people went to John and expressed their desire to repent, he buried them in water (vv. 6, 11). In order to enter into the reality of the New Testament, people must have a new beginning by being terminated and buried so that they can receive Christ as life and live Christ. Hence, the work of the first ministry by the first servant sent by God in the New Testament was to bury people. The work of John the Baptist was to bury people. John&rsquo;s baptism was equivalent to a burial. When people went to John, they had to confess that they were sinners, and then they needed to be terminated. John led them to repent, and then he buried them; that is, he terminated them. He had to terminate and bury them because they needed a new beginning in Christ. They needed to receive Christ as their life so that Christ could live out from them. Anyone who desires to partake of the grace, life, and blessings of the New Testament must be completely terminated and buried.</p>
<h2 class="head2">After Believing into the Lord,<br />
Man Needing to Be Baptized</h2>
<p>After believing, the first thing one should do as a Christian is to be baptized (28:19). To be baptized is to be buried. After a person believes into the Lord, he should let God do everything, and the first thing that God will do is to ask the church to bury, to put an end, to the believer. In order to live the life of a Christian, one must stand in the position of baptism, that is, in the position of one who has died, been buried, and then been raised up.</p>
