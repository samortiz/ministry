   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consecration is a great topic in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MOTIVE FOR CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised 2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every consecrated believer is motivated by the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have a desire to consecrate ourselves because the Lord s love constrains us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We no longer live to ourselves but to the Lord because we have been constrained by the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the original Greek constrain means to press.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s love in our hearts becomes a great power pressing us to love the Lord and to live to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His love is like a rushing flood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot help but consecrate ourselves to Him; we cannot withhold ourselves or what we have from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul says that the Lord s love constrains us because we judge that the Lord died on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we consider how the Lord died on our behalf, we would be constrained by His love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should take time to consider how the Lord suffered for us, bore our sins, and tasted death on our behalf so that His love could constrain us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should consider His love in His dying on our behalf, especially when we break bread to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we consider His love, the more our hearts will be touched and turned to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s love is the greatest love in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as this love caused the Lord to die for us, it also causes us to live to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul exhorted us through the compassions of God to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exhort may also be rendered as beg.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy Spirit within often begs us through the compassions of God, through God s love, to consecrate ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The love of God is a great power used by the Holy Spirit to move us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you love Me more than these?...Do you love Me?...Follow Me John 21:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter was called by the Lord to follow Him, but he backslid and returned to his old profession of fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord came to seek him, He did not rebuke or blame Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He only asked, Do you love Me more than these? that is, more than his boats, his nets, the sea, the fish, the coals, and the loaves of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is as if the Lord was quietly saying, On the night that I was accused, you went to warm yourself, and you loved a charcoal fire to such an extent that you denied Me before those people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I hid My visible presence from you, you went fishing to make a living and did not pay attention to My command.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You warmed yourself but were put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You went fishing to get something to eat but came up empty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I have prepared a charcoal fire, bread, and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You do not need to expend any energy; you do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you want warmth, here is a charcoal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you want to eat, here are bread and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I want to ask, Do you love Me more than these more than the charcoal fire, bread, and fish?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Follow Me!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s questioning in love touched and gained Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord s love caused Peter to follow the Lord for his whole life until he was martyred for the Lord and glorified God by his death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to tradition, when Peter was arrested for the Lord s sake, he asked to be crucified upside down at the time of his death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His love the Lord questions us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He often asks, Do you love Me more than the world?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you love Me more than your father, mother, wife or husband , children, brothers, sisters, and friends?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you love Me more than education, position, fame, family background, money, and life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many have been truly conquered by the Lord s loving questioning and have become lovers of the Lord, pouring themselves and all that they have on the Lord for His gain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, who can stand before the Lord s questioning in love?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who can resist the constraining of the Lord s love?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord s love is revealed to us and works in us, we cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can only consecrate ourselves and all that we have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we are touched by His love, we must consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This motivating power is not outside of us but inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It burns like a raging fire that cannot be quenched.</S>
