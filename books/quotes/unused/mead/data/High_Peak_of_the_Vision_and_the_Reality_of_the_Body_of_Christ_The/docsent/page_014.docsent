   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BECOMING GOD, HAVING GOD'S LIFE AND NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is not only the Creator but also a created one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The early theologians all believed this, but the latter theologians did not dare to teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"God becoming man and man becoming God" was very prevailing in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, early in the fourth century Athanasius, who was present at the Nicene Council, said that "He was made man that we might be made God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, this word means that God became a man in order to make all of us, His believers, God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This had already been spoken in the second century, but, later, people did not have the boldness to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What God created was a man, but that man had the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, God would come in to beget men to be His children, having His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, man is of God's kind in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is wrong with saying that man becomes God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I am very careful in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those in the early days taught this not as clearly and carefully as we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I especially point out that man becomes God without sharing the Godhead but having only God's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not one teacher in Christianity can oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we believe in the Lord, we receive God's life, and 2 Peter 1:4 says clearly that we can "become partakers of the divine nature."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can refute this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First John 3:2 tells us, "We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we can definitely lay a good groundwork for this among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE STEPS GOD TOOK TO MAKE MAN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God became man through the process of being incarnated, living a human life, being crucified, and entering into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How does God make man God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The process which God went through from incarnation to resurrection was the procedure for Him to become man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this Spirit He comes to carry out the work of making man God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, He is now the sanctifying Spirit, as we are told in 1 Peter 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were people fallen into sin, but some believers were moved by God to come and preach the gospel to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the preaching of the gospel this sanctifying Spirit comes to separate us, the God-chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit's sanctifying work on the sinners is like the woman's lighting a lamp and seeking carefully for the lost coin, as recorded in Luke 15 v. 8 . We were sanctified before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, at the time we heard the gospel, the Spirit put faith into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, when we believed, the life of God, which is God Himself, Christ Himself, entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sanctification we experience after our regeneration is not positional sanctification but dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Spirit separated us from sinners, that was the positional sanctification that took place before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Spirit comes into us to change our disposition, that is the dispositional sanctification that takes place after our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This dispositional sanctification is not accomplished in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This sanctification issues in renewing, which is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Renewing issues in transformation, which is also a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The final result of transformation is to be conformed to the image of the Lord and be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the first step of regeneration to the final step of conformation, everything is carried out by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, this Spirit will bring us into glory so that God will be completely expressed from within us through our corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time, our corrupted body will also be redeemed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is glorification, as spoken of in Romans 8:30: "Those whom He justified, these He also glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is by these steps that God is making us God.</S>
