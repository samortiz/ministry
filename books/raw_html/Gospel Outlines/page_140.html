<h1 class="title">THE UNGODLINESS AND<br />
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS OF MEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 1:18-32</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ungodliness of men
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s first relationship is the relationship between man and God. Chinese people talk about five ethical principles. Actually, on top of these five there should be one more principle, namely, the principle of the relationship between man and God. The first of these five principles is the principle for the relationship between man and his parents. In fact, the relationship between man and God is much higher than that between man and his parents. No doubt man is born of his parents, but he was born because God firstly created mankind. God is the source of our being; therefore man should worship and serve God. If man&rsquo;s relationship with God is normal, man will have the virtue of godliness. The word godliness is not used here to describe the relationship among men, but rather the relationship between man and God.</li>
	<li>Man should keep a normal relationship with God, but such was never established. Instead, men turn away from God and worship idols; consequently men become ungodly. There are some who do not worship idols, yet they deny the existence of God. They, too, are ungodly.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unrighteousness of men
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Human beings not only have a relationship with God, but also a relationship with men. The five ethical principles are concerning the relationship between men. The abnormal relationship among men is called unrighteousness. A man is unrighteous if he does not honor his parents, and if he is without respectfulness, loyalty, faithfulness, courtesy, righteousness, purity, or a sense of shame.</li>
	<li>Mention all the unrighteousness in Romans item by item; there are altogether twenty-nine items. Some of these refer to the sinful deeds, and others refer to the sinful people. Read these items beginning with verse 18. Sometimes the working of the Holy Spirit can really touch people&rsquo;s feeling. Do not read through all at once. Pause and ask the audience how they feel after reading each paragraph.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The relationship between ungodliness and unrighteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ungodliness is toward God; unrighteousness is toward men. Man is ungodly toward God first and then unrighteous toward men. All unrighteousness comes from ungodliness.</li>
	<li>Therefore, if man does not worship God, he definitely will be a source of trouble to his fellow man. Luke chapter 18 describes a man who does not fear God nor respect men. If man&rsquo;s relationship with God is not right, his relationship with men is definitely wrong. Atheists definitely are immoral. Homes without God are definitely dark homes. If man is improper toward men, it is because he is improper toward God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of ungodliness and unrighteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ungodliness and unrighteousness cause man to damage himself. If a man worships lower animals, he is destroying himself. There is no unrighteous man who does not destroy himself. The result of unrighteousness is destroying one&rsquo;s reputation, family, status, and position.</li>
	<li>Ungodliness and unrighteousness not only bring self-destruction, they also bring the wrath of God. Sometimes man meets the small anger of God, such as car accidents, sickness, or bankruptcy, etc. In the future he will meet the great wrath of God which is eternal perdition.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to depart from ungodliness and unrighteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent and confess that you are ungodly and unrighteous.</li>
	<li>Change your mind and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Be one who serves God.</li>
	</ol></li>
