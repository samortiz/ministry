<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(29)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. It was a wonderful environment. I was not contaminated too much by the world or sins. At the age of about seventeen I accepted the Lord and was baptized in a China Inland Mission Church. Later I was sent to preach the gospel. Once I read The Christian published by Brother Nee, and I was moved to leave the C.I.M. Those in the denomination thought that we were creating a division. In 1935 Brother Nee spoke clearly in Chuanchow, Fukien, about consecration. Although I had consecrated my will to the Lord, there was not much reality to my consecration. I admit that I do not have the eloquence, knowledge, or light. I can only speak a little. I know that if I can edify others a little today, it is altogether the Lord's work. In the past I thought that I was not bad. Today I feel that I no longer can stand up among the brothers and sisters. I became sick with tuberculosis through overextending myself in the work. The sickness comes and goes. However, I reaped much profit from the Lord through my sickness. I have to exult Him. I have vomited blood during my stay here, but I am somewhat different now. If you send me home, I will die. If I stay here, I have the confidence that I will not die. The Lord wants to break me, and the blessings I experience will multiply. Although I am over fifty years old, I am still like a child. I have been working for the Lord for twenty-eight years, but I still feel empty. I want to commit myself completely to the Lord's hand. May the Lord be merciful to me.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I hope that our brother will take more rest. When a person reaches middle-age, he has to exercise more care. You are working in the region around Wenchow, Chekiang, which is the area with the greatest concentration of believers. You should remain there and work there. If one wants to have thicker and firmer ice, he should not break it when it is still thin. In the church the knowledge of God's will is something committed to those who are more elderly; the older ones hold the reins. The younger co-workers can take care of the preaching, the gospel work, and the business affairs. The older ones also have to take some responsibilities in initiating the new moves, but they should not be burdened too much by the many affairs of the church; the young ones should be allowed to join in and to coordinate in the service.</p>
