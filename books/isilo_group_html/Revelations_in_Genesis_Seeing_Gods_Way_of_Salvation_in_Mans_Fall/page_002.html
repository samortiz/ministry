<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:16&mdash;3:6</h1>
<p>The record of God&rsquo;s creation in the first two chapters of Genesis reveals God&rsquo;s desire and purpose, and it reveals the procedure with which God achieves His purpose. These two chapters can be considered as a picture of the whole Bible. When God spoke the content of the Bible, He first presented a picture to show His eternal purpose, the procedure of His work, and the issue of His work. After this, Genesis 3 can be considered the beginning of the official narration of man&rsquo;s history in the Bible. Regrettably, however, this narration begins with the fall of man. Immediately after presenting a picture of His creation, God presents the fall of man.</p>
<p>We will first consider the source of man&rsquo;s fall, that is, the cause of the fall of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAUSE OF THE FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Serpent&rsquo;s Temptation</h2>
<p>The first cause of the fall of man was the serpent&rsquo;s temptation. Without the serpent&rsquo;s temptation and deception, man would not have fallen. The serpent that tempted man was the incarnation of Satan. Apparently, he was a serpent; actually, he was Satan. Satan hid in the serpent in order to tempt man. Therefore, Revelation 12:9 says, &ldquo;The ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Genesis 3:1, the serpent was made by Jehovah. We should not think that because the serpent is bad, he was not made by God or that what God made cannot become the incarnation of Satan. In the universe only God is life. Anything that is not of God or is severed from God, even though it was made by God, can be in the principle of the serpent; that is, it can be usurped by Satan to be his incarnation.</p>
<p>Some thank and praise the Lord for blessing them, for giving them an education, or for giving them intelligence. Others thank and praise the Lord for giving them a good spouse and good children. We should acknowledge that such things are from the Lord, but we must not forget that if these God-given persons, matters, and things are severed from God, they can be an embodiment of Satan and can be used by Satan.</p>
<p>The serpent was made by God, but in Genesis 3 the serpent was used by Satan, who hid within him, thus making the serpent the incarnation of Satan. This serpent was not only attractive but also cunning. Anyone who is cunning and clever is crafty. Dull people are not crafty, but clever people are inevitably crafty. Nearly every clever person is crafty. Being attractive, cunning, and clever are related to being crafty. Some people are very clever and considerate of others, but they are like &ldquo;sly old foxes&rdquo; and may have poison in them. Therefore, we must be watchful and guard ourselves against things that are attractive to us, for they can be the embodiment of Satan. Satan often hides within these things to tempt and deceive man.</p>
<p>How did the serpent tempt Eve? The serpent might have wrapped himself around the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to tempt Eve. When Eve noticed the serpent, she also noticed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent tempted Eve by asking a question, which caused her to doubt God&rsquo;s word. The first question in the Bible came out of Satan&rsquo;s mouth. A great American evangelist, Dr. Haldeman, once said that when the serpent tempted Eve that day, saying to Eve, &ldquo;Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?&rdquo; (v. 1), he might have shaped himself into a hook, a question mark. This is quite meaningful. All questions originate from Satan. When man accepted that question, he fell into the hand of Satan and became fallen.</p>
<p>The serpent asked a question, which caused Eve to doubt God&rsquo;s word. God commanded man, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (2:17). However, Satan asked, &ldquo;Did God really say...?&rdquo; (3:1), and then said, &ldquo;You shall not surely die!&rdquo; (v. 4). Man accepted Satan&rsquo;s question, doubted God&rsquo;s word, and dared to take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and to eat it. To this day Satan uses this method to tempt man to sin or to instigate man to reject God&rsquo;s salvation. Man needs to know how steadfast the Lord&rsquo;s word is: &ldquo;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away&rdquo; (Luke 21:33). The Lord&rsquo;s word is not yes and no (2 Cor. 1:19-20).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the serpent&rsquo;s question caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s heart. The serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil&rdquo; (Gen. 3:5). The serpent wanted the woman to believe that God was deceiving them by forbidding them to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest, like God, they would know good and evil. This is another of the sinister schemes that Satan often uses. People are far away from God and will not come to God, because they have been fooled by Satan to misunderstand God&rsquo;s love and not know God&rsquo;s heart.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Way of Salvation in Man's Fall &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
