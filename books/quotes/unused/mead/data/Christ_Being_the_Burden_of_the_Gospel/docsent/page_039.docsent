   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus, through His Death and Resurrection, Solving the Aspect of Man s Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The final aspect of our threefold problem is related to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This aspect has been solved by the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if we spoke for a month, we could not adequately cover the mystery of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of resurrection can be seen in the biological world, including the plant life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a grain of wheat is buried in the ground, it dies and its outward shell decays, but when it decays, something from within the seed begins to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This speaks of the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A chick breaking out of its shell also illustrates the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Biologists tell us that many things receive life through the process of death, passing from death into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although this is a mysterious matter, the principle of resurrection can be seen in the biological realm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Scriptures tell us that His resurrection released His glorious life from within Him John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as our voice is transmitted through radio waves, the Lord s life is released through the Holy Spirit into everyone who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we call on Him and draw near to Him, a wonderful thing happens: His Spirit enters into us with His life so that we may have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we have another life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At our birth we received our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when we repented and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, He came into us with His life to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are now two kinds of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we were born, we received the human life, and when we believed in the Lord, we received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After receiving the Lord, every saved person soon discovers that there are two persons with two lives inside him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first person is our old man with our original sinful life; the second person is the Lord Jesus with His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first life comes from our parents; the second life comes from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is the life of man; the second is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life of man is evil and corrupt, but the life of God is holy and good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life of man is dark, but the life of God is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And the life of man corrupts man, but the life of God empowers man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two lives within a believer are in constant opposition to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, the divine life that we have received by believing on the Lord Jesus is more powerful than our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were regenerated, we received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we can live by the life of the Lord Jesus, rather than by our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salvation changes the source of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation solves the deepest aspect of our threefold problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord died for our sins on the cross, He solved the aspect of our problem related to our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we believed in Him and called on Him, He also solved the aspect of our problem related to our nature by applying His death to our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, when we believed in Him and called on Him, He entered into us as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to be our life and to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This solved the aspect of our problem related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather than having only our original corrupted life, we now have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With His life we also have a new nature, which is holy and good and which produces proper behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OUR WONDERFUL SAVIOR ACCOMPLISHING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A WONDERFUL WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is how the Lord Jesus saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As our wonderful Savior, He has accomplished a wonderful way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a person believes in Him and fellowships with Him, his sins are forgiven, his nature is transformed, and he receives God s holy and glorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord s salvation solves the problem of our behavior, our nature, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is what He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now He wants to live in us and become one with us by being mingled with us; in this way He becomes our living, glorious, and wonderful Savior.</S>
