   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE TWO THE OLD AGE AND DECEASE OF DAVID Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 1:1 2:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the old age and decease of David.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. BEING OLD AND FADING AWAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David not only became old but was also fading away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To fade away is different from being old, which is common.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>David's life had a good beginning, like the bright sun rising, and his life with his career became like the sun shining at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, his indulgence in lust spoiled his career and caused his bright life to fade like the sunset in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In David's old age there was nothing bright, excellent, or splendid.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>MAKING SOLOMON THE SUCCESSOR TO HIS THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David made Solomon the successor to his throne 1:5-53 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Solomon's source was David's indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Solomon's mother was the wife of Uriah, a Gentile leader of David's army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David murdered Uriah and took his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As David was appointing Solomon as his successor, he could not have felt glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>David's appointing of Solomon was strong evidence of God's forgiveness and unlimited grace, but David nevertheless must have felt a sense of shame about it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Joab, the captain of David's army, who participated in Uriah's murder, might never have lost his negative feeling about David's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It might have been because of this that Joab joined Adonijah in his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this we can see that our sinning is not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It spoils everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>David's indulgence greatly spoiled his name, his position, and even his ending.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the fading, the sunset, of David's life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>David's indulgence became a seed which issued in the tragedy of the loss of the good land and the capture of the holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The effects of this tragedy have lasted even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This should serve as a warning to all the young people among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must not contact the other sex in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As brothers and sisters in the church we cannot avoid contacting one another, but we must always keep a distance from the other sex.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>David's indulgence in sin began with just one look.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His one glance caused him to fall to such an extent with such a tragic result.</S>
