   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY AND HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRODUCE ONE ENTITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time of David, the divine revelation reached the point where God showed David what He wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God revealed to David that He could not be satisfied simply to have a man who was according to His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, God indicated to David that He wants to build Himself into the man who is according to His heart and to make this man His building as His house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then out from this house would issue a seed of humanity, yet this seed would become the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This involves the mingling of divinity with humanity, a mingling that eventually produces the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this mingling God and man, man and God, are blended together into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This entity is God's building, which is a mutual abode for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This entity, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature, also is the wife of the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This entity, the New Jerusalem, will remain forever and will be the centrality and universality of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the entire and complete revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible begins with the tree of life, the flowing river, the precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone, and a builded wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of the Bible, we see again the tree of life with the flow of the living water, three kinds of material gold, pearls, and precious stones and a builded wife, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The beginning of the Bible shows God's goal, and the end shows God's achievement and attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's goal, and both God and we are heading toward it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With this revelation as our "road map," we can know where we are and where we will be for eternity.</S>
