   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John was the one who was closest to the Lord, because he leaned on the Lord's breast John 21:20, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son is in the bosom of the Father, and John was in the bosom of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet the day he saw the Lord, he fell at His feet as dead, because He is the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly, we saw Him as the Lord of grace; now we see Him as the Lord of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the judgment here is the judgment of a priest, for it involves trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On that day it will be entirely judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every one of God's children must one day meet the Lord's fearfulness and holiness; then they will no longer reason.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Light disposes of all reasons it not only illuminates; it also kills.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The illumination in every part of the Bible kills the natural life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Men may have many reasons, but before the Lord they are all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All men will fall dead to the ground just as John did.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The farther a person is from the Lord, the greater is his self-confidence; but it is impossible for him to bear the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be dealt with by God at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first part of each epistle tells us who the Lord is, and the word that follows is based on this revelation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who does not know the Lord cannot see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is the continuation of the cross; there is no such thing as knowing the cross yet not knowing the extension of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These seven epistles start with the Lord and end with the call to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are they special ones, those who are above the ordinary?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible the meaning of the overcomers is that they are the normal, ordinary ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are not abnormal during the time of abnormality are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most people are below this level.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The overcomers are not above this level, but at this level.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is calling the overcomers today to rise up and walk according to the normal pattern in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The will of God never changes; it is just like a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today men fall, fail, and continually go downward; but the overcomers are recovered anew into the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see two more matters: First, the church is the golden lampstand, and the Lord walks in the midst of the lampstands; second, the Lord holds the seven stars in His right hand, which are the angels of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each of the various kinds of metals spoken of in the Bible has meaning: iron typifies political power, brass typifies judgment, silver typifies redemption, and gold typifies the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The glory of God is one thing that no one knows or comprehends.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although it is difficult to comprehend the holiness of God, we can still comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The righteousness of God can also be understood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the glory of God has never been known, because it is the one characteristic that belongs most uniquely to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The people in the church are born of God, not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church has absolutely nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some ask what the work of wood, grass, and stubble is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wood, grass, and stubble are the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work of gold, silver, and precious stones is that which is entirely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These seven epistles were written to the angels of the seven churches, differing from the first seven Epistles written by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul wrote to the churches, although we see that there were all the saints, overseers, and deacons, especially in the book to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the epistles were written to the angels of the seven churches, not directly to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, they were the words spoken by the Holy Spirit to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word angel in Greek is angelos.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word represents one who is a messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people, after reading Revelation 2 and 3, have tried to find similarities between the last seven epistles and the first seven and have injected all manner of wrong explanations regarding the messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who is this messenger?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The messenger spoken of here is singular in number; the epistles were written to a singular messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this singular number is corporate in nature; that is why, at the end of each epistle, the calling is to the overcomers in plural.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This messenger is a corporate messenger who can represent a minority in the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At this point the way of God is different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Formerly, the church stood before the Lord; now the messenger stands before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The light of the lamp is inferior to the light of the star.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has chosen the inextinguishable starlight and said that this is His messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This star is in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today a group of people is a messenger in the eyes of the Lord; thus, the nature of the church today is entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the church has a problem before the Lord in her outward appearance, the Lord sees a group of people a messenger who can be the representative of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Formerly, the representatives of the church were the elders with position and office; now the responsibility of representing the church is given to the spiritual messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This messenger is not necessarily the elders or deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today God places the responsibility upon whoever can represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who can represent the church have the responsibility committed to them by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today it is not a matter of position and office, but of having real spiritual authority before God to such ones God turns over the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation is written to the "slaves" of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, unless you are a slave, you will not be able to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He who is not bought with the blood and constrained by love to be a slave cannot understand Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John wrote Revelation in A.D. 95 or 96 at the time Domitian was Caesar in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of the twelve apostles, John was the last to die; therefore, the church of the apostles ended with John.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When John was writing, the seven epistles were prophetic.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today when we read the seven epistles, we also must regard them as prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, when we consider them today, they have already become history.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>John was looking ahead, while we are looking back.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we will look at the seven churches in the seven epistles one by one.</S>
