   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Can we forbid outside brothers from preaching at will in our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: We should pray and ask God to stop the disenchanted ones in the denominations from coming into our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should deal seriously with this matter so that the disenchanted ones in the denominations will not come and express anything in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Question: Who should prepare the bread for the bread-breaking meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: According to the Bible, the preparation of the bread should be done by the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no difference between a deacon and a deaconess; either a deacon or a deaconess can prepare the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Question: Should the bread and the cup used in the bread-breaking meeting be covered with a piece of cloth, and should the table also be covered with a tablecloth?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: The practice of covering the cup and the bread with a piece of cloth is a Catholic tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Catholics think that if they do not cover them, they will not be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But according to 1 Corinthians 11, it is wrong to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The breaking of bread is a display of the Lord s death; it is for exhibiting the Lord s death, and it is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why then should it be covered?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to the tablecloth, there is complete liberty as to what one wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the table is not too clean, it is all right to cover it with a tablecloth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Question: If it is a biblical teaching for the sisters to cover their head, why do we not practice kissing each other with a holy kiss since the latter is also a biblical command?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Answer: The Bible says that we should kiss each other with a holy kiss 1 Cor 16:20 ; it does not charge believers to merely kiss each other.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The command of the Bible is that if anyone greets another with a kiss, the kiss should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s command is that when we kiss, we have to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has not charged us merely to kiss.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Neither have the apostles charged everyone to kiss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Kissing can very easily become unholy; therefore, there is the charge to kiss with a holy kiss.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If anyone were to ask me whether we should kiss, I would say we should.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible also tells us that if we kiss, we have to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The emphasis of this command is to be holy and not just to kiss.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If one kisses, he should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Provided we are holy, I believe it is right for us to practice this biblical command to kiss each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As to the sisters covering their heads, there are many benefits to the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the meetings, the sisters should have the sign of submission to authority for the sake of the angels 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the original language, the word authority in 1 Corinthians 11:10 refers to a positional authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a positional authority because Satan was also an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first sin of Satan was his self ; that was the cause of his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When his self was expressed, he overturned God s authority and rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The most amazing thing in the universe is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see that God works through authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He upholds the universe with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The name of Christ is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has placed Satan under His own authority, yet Satan overturned this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The great dragon mentioned in Revelation is the old serpent; he dragged along with him one third of the stars of heaven 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that Satan led one third of the angels in heaven to rebel against God and overturn God s sovereign rule.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is known throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the story of the first introduction of sin into the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How did sin come into the world the second time?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It came in through Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God created Eve and ordained that Adam should be the head of Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul said in 1 Timothy that it was not Adam who was deceived, but Eve 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the sin in the garden of Eden was the same sin that Satan committed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This sin came in when the woman rebelled against Adam, the head, and did something before she was approved by Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, sin comes from insubordination to authority; sin is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because both Satan and Eve fell this way, God ordained that there should be a sign on the head of the woman as a symbol of submission for the sake of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a testimony before the angels, showing the angels that we will not do what Eve did at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, many sisters cannot take this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the greatest test to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the flesh is willing to be judged, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today, we will mention the head covering only in relationship to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are other aspects of head covering which we will not cover today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the garden of Eden, the woman refused to remain in her position.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today in the church, our sisters should be faithful to remain in their own position.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Question: Should we tell the sisters who have cut their hair to cover their head?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Answer: These minor questions are a great test to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, we should exhort the sisters who want to cut their hair to keep their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If they intend to cut it, we do not have to advise them to cover their head anymore because they have clearly given up the glory which God gives to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are two coverings for the sisters: One is a natural covering, and the other is a symbolic covering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a woman gives up her natural covering, the symbolic covering will be completely useless to her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The symbol on the head must be put on willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Question: When a brother prays or preaches on the street, should he take off his hat?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Answer: According to my personal experience, every time I pray, I take off my hat.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I feel that if I do not take off my hat, I am shaming my head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But this does not mean that God will not hear us if our brothers pray with their heads covered and our sisters pray with their heads uncovered.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our prayer and prophesying are particularly related to the angels and the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, personally, I feel that the brothers should not cover their head.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even when we are preaching to someone on the street, it is related to the spiritual realm; as such, it is not that proper to keep our hat on.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Question: What is the difference between preaching and prophesying?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Answer: All those who can preach edifying messages may not be prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A prophet is able not only to edify others, but also to foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A prophet is able not only to declare God s will, but also to foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Question: What should we do with the bread and grape juice after the bread-breaking meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Answer: They can be consumed by one or two brothers, or they can be burned in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Question: In breaking the bread, should we break some off from the whole piece, or can we eat from the crumbs on the plate?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Answer: Both are all right; there is no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are all from the same piece of bread.</S>
