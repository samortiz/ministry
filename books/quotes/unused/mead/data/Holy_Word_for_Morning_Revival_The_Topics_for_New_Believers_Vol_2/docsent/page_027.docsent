   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 13:38 ...And the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Pet 2:5 You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Believers Their Symbols</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this portion we shall...consider two of the...symbols of the believers found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>146</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Good Seed</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus says that the believers are wheat Matt 3:12 ; on the other hand, He tells us that the believers are the good seed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 13:38 He says, The good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 13:4 and 19 the seed sown by the Lord was the word of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 24 and 38 this seed has developed into the sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>147 Here three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These three cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word of the kingdom actually is Christ Himself as the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This seed eventually produces the sons of the kingdom, who are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>148 Therefore, the good seed, as well as the wheat, is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers, those regenerated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sowing of the good seed is a kind of martyrdom, for the seed experiences a real crucifixion and is put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who are willing to be sown, crucified, in this way will eventually grow, multiply, and be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But those who are not willing to be sown into the ground, who are not willing to be put to death, will be barren and unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>149</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Living Stones</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Testament the believers are also symbolized by stones and are called living stones 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These living stones are actually transformed sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we were sinners, but we are now in the process of being transformed into stones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>150</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transformation is the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>151 To be transformed is to be both charged and discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to be charged with Christ, just as a transformer is charged with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ is charged into us, He will discharge many old things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we will be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>152</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Peter 2:5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ v. 4 , through regeneration and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were created of clay Rom 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At Peter s conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter meaning a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock a stone Matt 16:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter was impressed by these two incidents that both Christ and His believers are stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>153</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Peter 2:4 speaks of Christ as a living stone....A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Christ for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life 1:23-24 , to a stone, which is of the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seed is for life-planting; the stone is for building 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter s thought went on from life-planting to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As life to us, Christ is the seed; for God s building, He is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, He will make us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone Isa 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>154</S>
