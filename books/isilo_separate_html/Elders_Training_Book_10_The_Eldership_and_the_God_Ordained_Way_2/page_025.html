However, it is not yet the fulfillment of the Lord's aspiration and prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness Possessed<br>by All the Believers in Christ,<br>Who Have Received the Spirit as the Seal<br>of God's Possession (the Church) and<br>the Pledge of Our Inheritance (the Triune God)</H2><P>This oneness is possessed by all the believers in Christ, who have received the Spirit as the seal of God's possession, which is the church, and the pledge of our inheritance, which is the Triune God (Eph. 1:13-14). Because we have received such a Spirit as the consummated God, we have the oneness. We all possess this oneness; this oneness is our possession. However, we need to experience it. To possess the oneness is to have the actuality of the oneness. When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Be Kept Diligently<br>by All the Believers</H2><P>First, we possess this oneness, and then we should keep it. This oneness must be kept diligently by all the believers in Christ with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love in the uniting bond of peace, that we may walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (Eph. 4:1-3). We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering. Then we need to bear one another in the divine love and in the uniting bond of the divine peace. In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
