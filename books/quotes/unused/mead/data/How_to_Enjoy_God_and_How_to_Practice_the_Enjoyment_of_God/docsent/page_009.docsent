   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching the Gospel Being to Enjoy God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regrettably, most of our prayers are not prayers in which we absorb God; instead, they are religious prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may pray, O God, I am going to preach the gospel today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Be with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Give me eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While we pray, we are thinking of eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What should I say to the chemistry professor?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should be the topic of the conversation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Should I speak concerning atomic power or satellites?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though we may pray for half an hour, we are thinking only about eloquence and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact, we have not really prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such prayers are useless because they do not touch God, contact Him, or absorb Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to preach the gospel, we should first spend half an hour or an hour contacting the Lord, beholding His glory, fellowshipping with Him, and praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should say, Lord, You are too lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are our Savior, and You are the Savior of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We come to enjoy You, to absorb You, and to live in the presence of Your countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to dwell in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need for us to think about preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to worry about our utterance or what we should say.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can forget about all of that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After absorbing the Lord and being filled with Him, we will not be the one speaking when we contact our professor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, the Lord whom we have absorbed will be the One who is speaking through us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The words that we speak will be the very Lord whom we have absorbed, and it will be impossible for others not to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses spent forty days and forty nights on the mountain before Jehovah, doing nothing other than absorbing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not feel anything when he came down from the mountain, but the children of Israel saw the shining of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why was his face shining?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God did not do anything for him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses merely spent forty days before the Lord, fellowshipping with Him and absorbing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He forgot about everything and was fully occupied with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For forty days and forty nights, Moses was fully absorbed with God and filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, his face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he presented himself before men, he did not need to say anything concerning God; they saw God s glory in his face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the wonder of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we ask for power, the more power eludes us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we forget about power and instead fellowship with God, absorb Him, and enjoy Him, we will have power without being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Receiving Leading Being to Enjoy God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have often heard the brothers and sisters speak of receiving the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not understand how to receive the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have said, Brother Lee, the more we seek the Lord s leading, the more confused we are, and the easier it is for us to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we say that something is the Lord s leading, we discover that it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can we know the Lord s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever I hear this, I ask, Have you prayed in your seeking for His leading?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They usually respond that they have, and then I ask how they prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I typically find that they pray to receive leading instead of to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They pray, Lord, should I go here, or should I go there?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While they pray, their mind is busy with these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are not actually praying to the Lord; they are praying for things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After praying, they consider the options and then decide which option is according to the Lord s will and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way many people pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, it is not surprising that they do not receive the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we know what fellowship with the Lord is, we do not need to pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can forget about all these things and simply contact the Lord, absorb Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the shortcut, the expeditious way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we absorb Him and enjoy Him, we will have His presence, which is His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as we do not have His presence, we do not have His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His leading is His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us consider the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their presence led the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud are simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do we have God s presence as we go to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do we have His presence as we speak on a particular subject?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are the only one active in preaching the gospel, and God neither moves nor gives us His presence, what we are doing is not under His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not have the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud if we are the only one speaking, and God is not speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He must speak in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Outwardly we may be speaking, but inwardly He must be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both He and we need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This kind of speaking is full of the Lord s presence, and this kind of speaking constitutes His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not a matter of right or wrong, correct or incorrect, or good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything depends on whether we have God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>With His presence, everything is right.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without His presence, everything is wrong.</S>
