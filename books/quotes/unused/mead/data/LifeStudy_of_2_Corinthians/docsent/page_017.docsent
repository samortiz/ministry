   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE EIGHT THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:12-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians Paul first speaks concerning the ministry and then concerning the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:14 he likens the ministry to a triumphal procession celebrating the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he goes on to speak of the function and competence of the ministry and also of its glory and superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 3:12 7:16 Paul comes to the ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to 3:12-18, these ministers are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two aspects of the Spirit are covered in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we understand these aspects of the Spirit, we shall see the constitution of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These ministers are not merely trained or taught; they are constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. CONSTITUTED BY AND WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AS THE LIFE-GIVING AND TRANSFORMING SPIRIT A. Their Hope and Boldness 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Using Much Boldness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 12 says, Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the boldness in speaking openly and freely about their ministry; not hiding anything, as Moses did when he covered his face with a veil v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The lasting glory of the new covenant ministry is the basis of the apostles hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In their ministry they have a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the ministry of Moses, by comparison, there was no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses put a veil on his face to conceal the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we read Exodus 34, we may have a positive impression about this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Corinthians 3, however, Paul does not interpret the veil in a positive sense, but in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Paul s interpretation, Moses put a veil on his face because he was afraid that the children of Israel would see the fading of the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fading means termination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, according to Paul s understanding, Moses realized that the shining on his face would not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this sense, Moses did not have any hope.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, he had a fearful concern.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in verse 12 Paul says that the ministers of the new covenant have hope, for the shining glory of the new covenant ministry remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having such a hope, the apostles used much boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you read the book of Exodus carefully, you will see that Moses did not have as much boldness in giving the law as the apostles did in ministering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more they ministered, the more boldness they had.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The longer they ministered, the more bold they became.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their boldness came from their confidence in the everlasting glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can testify that the more I minister Christ, the more bold I become.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though there is opposition to this ministry, I still have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually the opposition will fade.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have the confidence that we are ministering the truth that carries the glory and that the glory in this truth will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others may not believe what we are preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But in the next age, or in the New Jerusalem, they will believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not as Moses</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 13 Paul continues, And are not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the sons of Israel should not gaze unto the end of that which was being done away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While Moses spoke the word of God to the sons of Israel, he kept his glorified face unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After speaking, he veiled his face Exo 34:29-33 lest they see the end of his ministry, which was passing away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not want them to behold the termination of the fading glory of his ministry of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Veil Done Away in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 14 says, But their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being revealed that it is being done away in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here the word thoughts denotes things which proceed out of the mind 2:11; Phil 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, derivatively, the minds themselves Vincent .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this verse the preposition it refers to the fact that the veil is being done away in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since this fact was not revealed to the sons of Israel, their thoughts were hardened, and their minds were blinded.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The veil is being done away in Christ through the new covenant economy, yet it still remains in their minds when they read the old covenant v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 15 says, But unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moses here refers to Moses writings, the Pentateuch John 5:47 .</S>
