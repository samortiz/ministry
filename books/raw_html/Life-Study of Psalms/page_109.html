<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN ASKING GOD TO JUDGE HIM, EXAMINE HIM,<br>TRY HIM, AND TEST HIM</H2><P>Psalm 26 reveals the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him. Asking God to examine us, is like asking someone to come and examine a corpse. What is within us worthwhile for God to examine? We are like a corpse full of rottenness, corruption, and filthiness. But many readers of the Psalms love David's expressions in asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him. The New Testament term is this&#151;"I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20a). This means that we have been terminated. In this sense we are a corpse, unworthy of any kind of examination. Who has the boldness to ask God to come and examine him? I dare not do this.</P><P>When I was imprisoned by the invading Japanese army, I did not ask God, as David did, to judge me to see that I had walked in integrity or to examine me because I conducted myself in His truth (Psa. 26:1-3). Instead, I confessed my sins, shortcomings, wrongdoings, and defects to Him every day. We should tell the Lord, "Lord, I am good for nothing but death. But thank You that You have crucified me on the cross, and in baptism I have been buried. Now it should not be I who live, but You who live in me." What a great difference there is between this expression according to the revelation of the New Testament and David's expressions in Psalm 26!</P><P>Who dares to pray, "God, come and judge me, examine me, try me, and test me"? Are we worthy for God to try us? Within us are defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, offenses, transgressions, trespasses, evils, iniquity, sin, sins, and defilement. Many times we are not right in our inward attitude toward others. For this reason, each day I have to make confession to the Lord. Even before I speak in the meeting, I frequently pray, "Lord, forgive us and cleanse us with Your precious blood." If I do not confess my sins and my defilement, I cannot have a pure conscience with a strong spirit to speak for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Standing on His Walk in Integrity and in Truth<br>to Be in the Favor of God's Lovingkindness</H2><P>David was standing on his walk in integrity and in truth to be in the favor of God's lovingkindness (Psa. 26:1, 3, 11a). This concept belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P>
