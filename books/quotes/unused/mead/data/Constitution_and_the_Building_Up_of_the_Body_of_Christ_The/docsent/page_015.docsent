   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S CORRUPTION A. By Leavening the Initial Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan's corruption of the church began with his leavening the initial church, typified by the two wave-loaves offered to God on the day of Pentecost Lev 23:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leviticus 23 says that on the day of Pentecost, God requested His people to offer two leavened loaves, not unleavened loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That indicates that from the first day the church was established, the church was already impure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was confirmed by the sinful case of Ananias and Sapphira in deceiving God the Spirit Acts 5:1-11 and the case of the murmuring concerning the overlooking of the daily dispensing to the widows Acts 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. By Leavening the Church in Corinth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan also corrupted the church by leavening the church in Corinth with the gross sin of fornication 1 Cor 5:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. By Leavening the Church with Different Teachings Other Than the Economy of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan's corrupting work is also by leavening the church with different teachings other than the teaching of the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul exhorted Timothy to remain at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This tells us that even in the early days among the churches different teachings were being taught.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Different teachings create divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because there are hundreds of different teachings today, there are also hundreds of different groups, different divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a kind of leavening to divide the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. By Leavening the Entire Meal</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>through a Woman</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan's corruption is portrayed in Matthew 13:33, which speaks of the leavening of the entire meal fine flour made of the grains of wheat through a woman the Catholic Church as the false prophetess Jezebel Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the Catholic Church itself is a false prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. By Leavening the Early Church</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>with Judaism, Gnosticism, and Asceticism</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan worked to leaven the early church with Judaism in Sabbath keeping Col 2:16 ; in circumcision practice Acts 15:1-2; Gal 6:15 ; in the so-called holy diet Acts 11:2-3; Gal 2:12-13 ; and in traditions Gal 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also leavened the early church with Gnosticism Col 2:8 and asceticism Col 2:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These "isms" were leaven by which the church was corrupted.</S>
