   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE IMPORTANCE OF WITNESSING A. Being a Great Joy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The two happiest days in every believer's life are the day he believes in the Lord and the day when, for the first time, he leads another person to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first one, of course, is a particularly happy day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the joy of leading another person to the Lord for the first time may be greater than the joy experienced on the day of his own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Learning to Be Wise</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Proverbs 11:30 says, "He that winneth souls is wise."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the very beginning of our Christian life, we should learn to win souls by various means.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should learn to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will make us useful persons in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not talking about delivering a gospel message on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Platform preaching can never replace the personal work of leading people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who knows only to preach from the platform may not know how to lead people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not exhorting you to give a message on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are asking you to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people are good at preaching, but not at saving men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not know what to do when a person is brought to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are of little use.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The really useful ones are the ones who can lead men to Christ one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Begetting Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No tree will sprout without further growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, no one can have God's life without begetting more life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who never witness to sinners are probably in need of others witnessing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who have no desire or interest in leading others to repentance unto the Lord are probably in need of repentance themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are silent for the Lord in front of others probably need to listen again to the voice of God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can be so advanced that he no longer needs to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can advance to the degree that he no longer needs to witness to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>New believers need to learn to witness to others from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something we have to do for the rest of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you become a little more advanced in the spiritual life, others may tell you, "You have to be a channel of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should be one with the Holy Spirit so that the living water the Holy Spirit can flow into you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, a channel has two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This channel of the Holy Spirit, this channel of life, also has two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One end is toward the Holy Spirit, toward life, and toward the Lord, while the other end is toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The living water will never flow if the end toward man is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can be so wrong as to assume that just opening to the Lord is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The living water does not flow through those who are opened just to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One end must be opened to the Lord, and the other end must be opened to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The living water will flow out only when both ends are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people are powerless before God because the end toward the Lord is not open.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But many more people are powerless because the end for witnessing and leading others to Christ is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>D. Experiencing the Misery of Eternal Separation</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people have not heard the gospel because you have not yet testified to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The consequence of this is eternal separation; it is not merely temporal parting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is too crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A brother was once invited to another person's home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As he was very learned and eloquent, he spoke quite much on intellectual subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another elderly friend who lived nearby was also present at the dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since both were very intellectual, they talked for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was getting late, and the host invited them to stay overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elderly friend's room was directly opposite to this brother's room.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not long after they retired to their rooms, the brother heard the sound of something falling to the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When he went to the other room, he saw the friend lying on the floor, dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Other people started rushing into the room.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brother said sadly, "If I had known that this was going to happen, I would not have spoken what I spoke two hours ago!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I would have pointed out eternal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I did not spend even five minutes speaking to him about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I did not give him an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I knew what I now know, I would have tried my best to tell him about the Lord's crucifixion for him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is too late!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I had told him these words at dinner time, you would have laughed at me for speaking at an inopportune time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But it is too late for him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that you will listen now.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every person needs to believe in the Lord Jesus and in His cross!"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is an eternal separation; this separation is not just temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What a tragedy!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once the opportunity is gone, a man will be eternally barred from heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must seek out every opportunity to testify to others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>D. L. Moody was very good at leading men to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He once made up his mind to preach the gospel to at least one person a day, whether or not he was giving a message on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One day he went to bed, and then he remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone yet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He changed his clothes and went out again to look for someone he could speak to.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was already midnight when he looked at his watch; the streets were empty.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Where could he find anyone at such an hour?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The only person he could speak to was a policeman who was on duty: "You must believe in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The policeman was in a bad mood over something at that moment, and he scolded Moody angrily, saying, "Do you not have something better to do than persuade me to believe in Jesus in the middle of the night?"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Moody went home after sharing a brief word with him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the policeman was touched by Moody's word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A few days later he visited Moody and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should make a resolution before the Lord to lead men to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everyone should have a record of how many souls he will save in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He may resolve to save ten or twenty a year.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He should then begin to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>General prayers are useless prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you go to the Lord and say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Please save sinners," it is too general a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You must have a specific goal in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you want ten, aim for ten.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you want twenty, aim for twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You can prepare a book in which you write down the names of the ones you have gained for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As you gain one, write his name down.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At the end of the year, you can count the number of those who were saved and the number who remain unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Continue to pray for those who are not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Every brother and sister should practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not too much to gain thirty or fifty souls a year; ten or twenty is common.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must ask the Lord for a specific number in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord wants to hear our specific prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should pray to the Lord every day and should testify whenever there is opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If all of us preach the gospel and lead people to the Lord this way, our spiritual life will advance quickly in a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must uphold the torchlight of the gospel and must light everyone around us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Let every Christian go forth to light others.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The testimony of the gospel needs to go out from us until the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not be lit ourselves without lighting others.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should light more and more candles.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>So many souls before our eyes are in need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must try our best to testify to them and lead them to Christ.</S>
