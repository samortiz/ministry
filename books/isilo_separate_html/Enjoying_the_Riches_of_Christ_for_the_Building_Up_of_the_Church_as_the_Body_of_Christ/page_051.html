It covers the Christian daily life and the church meetings. If we wish to know how a Christian must live day by day, we have to come to this book. Likewise, if we seek to know how the church has to meet, we have to come to this book. In no other book are these two matters-the Christian daily life and the church meetings-more fully and adequately covered. I am afraid that many have read this book for years without seeing these two matters. They have been distracted by certain points in it. As we have pointed out, this book deals with eleven great problems. For this reason many are unable to pick up the main points when they read this book. When they get into this book, they become distracted, puzzled, and even perplexed by these eleven great problems. However, the secret to reading 1 Corinthians is to not care for the problems. With Christ and the church there is no problem.<p>Someone may say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is no problem. The more I come to the church, the more problems I have.&#8221; If this is so, it means that he has not yet entered into the church. When we enter in, there are no more problems. There is only Christ and the cross. The cross is the biggest, most prevailing, and most effective &#8220;germicide&#8221; for our problems. It can kill any kind of &#8220;germ,&#8221; even such a great &#8220;germ&#8221; as the devil. Today in modern medicine there are many kinds of medicines, but we have only one kind of medicine-the cross. When we get into the church life, there are no problems because we have the cross of Christ as the antibiotic, something that is always killing. Paul said, &#8220;For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:2), that is, Christ and the cross. Hallelujah, if we have the cross, what problems can we have? If we take just one &#8220;dose&#8221; of the cross, everything is fine. Do not be bothered by the problems. In the church life there is no problem.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH OF GOD WHICH IS IN CORINTH</h2><p>First Corinthians is wonderful. This wonderful book starts in a wonderful way. No other book of the sixty-six books in the Bible starts in such a way. It starts with &#8220;to the church of God&#8221; (1:2a). Today many Christians do not pay attention to the church. They speak of certain kinds of churches, not the church of God. But 1:2 speaks of the church of God which is in a locality, Corinth, like the church in Chicago, Atlanta, or Detroit. This is not a church in theory, a church &#8220;in the air,&#8221; but a church on this earth, and not only on this earth but in a locality. This expression is so definite. We all must have such a church, a church of God on this earth and in our locality.<h2 class=head1>THE SANCTIFIED AND CALLED SAINTS</h2><p>Moreover, the persons in this church are sanctified and called, not called sinners or even called believers, but called saints. The word saints means the holy ones. Do you believe that you are a holy one? In the Catholic Church and even in some of the denominations, especially the Church of England, certain ones are referred to as saints, such as Saint Paul. When we hear people refer to Saint Paul, we have to tell them that we also are a saint. We all are called saints. In the church everyone is a saint. We may believe that the Corinthian believers must have been marvelous to be called saints. However, the following verses speak of divisions (vv. 11-12), and chapter three speaks of jealousy and strife, saying that they were still infants and were not only fleshly but fleshy (3:1, 3). Still, they were called saints. Praise the Lord, we are the called saints!<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
