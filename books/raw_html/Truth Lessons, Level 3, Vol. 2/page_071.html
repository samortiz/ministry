 <h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO WITNESSES BEING<br />
THE TWO SONS OF OIL BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>The two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth (Rev. 11:4). They are olive trees who produce olive oil to supply the need of the lampstands. Hence, they become the storehouses of the olive oil, the sons of oil, to supply the lampstands with the oil needed for their shining. They are called &ldquo;the sons of oil&rdquo; because they are full of oil, that is, full of the Spirit. They are also called the lampstands; in the last three and a half years they will replace the churches as the lampstands for God&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah spoke for God to His people and supplied them with His Spirit. The word of God is the Spirit of God, who is signified by the olive oil. Therefore, Moses and Elijah are the two sons of oil standing before God to supply God&rsquo;s people with the Spirit in God&rsquo;s word as the olive oil that they may receive the rich Spirit to be God&rsquo;s lampstand shining and testifying for God.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah minister not only to God&rsquo;s Old Testament people but also to God&rsquo;s New Testament believers. In the great tribulation, when Antichrist carries out his persecution by his evil power, the two witnesses will prophesy, speak for God, and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist. During the days of the great tribulation, the persecution will become very cruel and intense so that Antichrist will even force the Jews to forsake their religion. Hence, God will send Moses and Elijah, who are filled with the Spirit, to establish the Jews; at the same time, they will also establish the believers who still remain in the great tribulation. According to Revelation 14, once the firstfruits are raptured, Antichrist will come to persecute God&rsquo;s people, compelling them to worship him and his image (vv. 9-12). At that time the two witnesses will come to minister to the believers who will pass through the great tribulation. Their becoming the sons of oil is something real and not vain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Zechariah 4:2 likens God&rsquo;s people, the Israelites, to the golden lampstand, which testifies for God on the earth. There is an olive tree on both the right and the left side of the lampstand to produce olive oil to supply the need of the lampstand. The two olive trees are also called the two sons of oil. In Revelation 11 they are called the two witnesses and the two prophets, signifying Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah as representatives of the Old Testament law and prophets appeared before the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets, stand before God to testify for God. The Bible also prophesied that Elijah will come again, indicating that he will be one of the two witnesses. Furthermore, one of the two witnesses in Revelation will devour the enemies with fire and shut heaven so that no rain may fall, as Elijah did; another will turn water into blood and smite the earth with every plague, as Moses did. This proves that the two witnesses are Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>The two witnesses are also called the sons of oil because they are full of oil, that is, full of the Spirit. They are also called the lampstands; in the last three and a half years they will replace the churches as the lampstands for God&rsquo;s testimony that shines forth for God. Moses and Elijah as the two sons of oil live before God to supply God&rsquo;s people with the Spirit in God&rsquo;s word as the olive oil that they may receive the rich Spirit to be God&rsquo;s lampstand shining and testifying for God. They also supply God&rsquo;s New Testament believers. In the great tribulation, when Antichrist carries out his persecution by his evil power, the two witnesses will prophesy, speak for God, and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist. They will be filled with the Spirit to establish the Jews who are being persecuted and at the same time establish and minister to the believers who remain in the great tribulation after the rapture of the firstfruits.</p>
