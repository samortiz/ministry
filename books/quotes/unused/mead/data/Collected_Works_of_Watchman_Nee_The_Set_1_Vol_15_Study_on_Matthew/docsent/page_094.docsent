   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first coming of the Lord, He manifested authority such as in casting out demons and healing the sick and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second coming of the Lord will manifest power and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During His earthly ministry, people were astonished that His teaching had authority Matt 7:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Pharisees asked about the source of His authority Matt 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>See also the words of the centurion in Matthew 8:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second coming will manifest not only authority but also power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will no longer ride on the foal of a donkey as the King of peace but will ride on a white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His coming in power is for the execution of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the future Satan will perform many lawless deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord will destroy him with His power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Authority and power are two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The moving of a car demonstrates power, while the hand of a policeman is a sign of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Lord's first coming, His healing of the sick, casting out of demons, and calming of the wind and the waves were a matter of the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But at His second coming, He will exercise His power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord overthrew the tables and whipped the sellers of cattle and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this was an exercise of His human strength, the real whipping was not executed on the human bodies; the real significance was a demonstration of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Coming on the clouds of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first rapture will be a rapture to the throne; the second rapture will be to the clouds in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Lord will descend on the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 31:"And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, according to Matthew 23:37, after the great tribulation the Lord will call together all the chosen who are scattered among the Gentiles Isa 45:4; 65:9; Deut 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"From the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end" does not indicate a rapture, because the word used for "coming" in verse 30 is erchomai and not parousia, and here in verse 31 it is only a "gather ing ...together" Deut 30:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews were killed, captured, or scattered among all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will remain scattered until, according to this passage, the Lord begins to call them back see Isa 43:5-7: "From the east, / And...from the west.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>/ I will say to the north...</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>/ And to the south."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah 49:9-13: "From the land of the Sinim," referring to China.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hunan province there are still many Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They take the last name Tseng.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isaiah 49:22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:13; and Ezekiel 34:13; 37:21 also refer to the dispersed Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The expression "the four winds" means that there are Jews everywhere, because winds continually move and have no fixed place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, here the calling together, or gathering together, does not refer to the rapture of the church for the following reasons: 1 The parousia has passed, and the rapture is within the scope of the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 Here it is a gathering together; it has nothing to do with the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3 To say that it is the rapture of the church does not agree with the previous texts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4 If it refers to the Jews, it is consistent with Matthew 23:37.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>5 In 1 Thessalonians 4 there is the sound of the trumpet and the Lord coming to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>6 The previous texts all refer to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The above verses are the first large section.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 32:"But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord spoke this section of the prophecy on the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There were many fig trees there, so the Lord used them in the parable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"As soon as its branch has become tender" refers to the return of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Puts forth its leaves" indicates the manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fig tree signifies the Jews Jer 24:2, 5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Previously the Lord cursed the fig tree that had leaves but no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that He cursed those Jews who had an outward form but not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Leaves signify a show or outward behavior, indicating the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time the Passover, the Feast of Purim, and all the offerings and sacrifices will be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Summer refers to a time for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Winter refers to the time of death and drying up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the summer everything is flourishing and full of life; everything is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a golden time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Jews today are in the winter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Winter refers to tribulation, particularly to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spring refers to the rapture S.S. 2:10-11, 13 . Summer refers to the kingdom Luke 21:30-31 . Luke 21:29-30 mentions all the other kinds of trees.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These trees refer to the nations see Daniel and Judges .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the nations also put forth branches; that is, today among all the tribes and races, nationalism is especially prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even Scotland, Mongolia, and the tribe of Hui in Xingjiang province have all tried to become independent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 33: "So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Keep in mind that verses 4 through 31 constitute one continuous section and should not be broken up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The difference between 24:4-31 and 24:32 25:46 is that the first section refers to Jews and the second section refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The phrase "all these things" in verse 33 is linked to 23:36, which says, "All these things shall come upon this generation."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In 24:8 "all these things" refers to the beginning of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, in verse 33 "all these things" refer to the false Christs, wars, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, etc.; they also refer to the beginning of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Know that it is near."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"It" refers to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This corresponds with Luke 21:31, which says that "the kingdom of God is near."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 34:"Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"Generation" is genea, which is not the same as aeon.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Chinese interpret a generation as thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Other nations consider forty years as a generation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such an understanding makes it difficult to explain this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"This" generation would become the generation who lived when Matthew lived.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then these things should have already been fulfilled; by now they should have already taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The teaching of the historical school that Matthew 24 has taken place is based on this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They say that the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus was exactly forty years after the Lord spoke verse 34, and that was a generation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because of this kind of difficulty, some change the word "generation" to "race," saying that it refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not correct, because: 1 in Matthew 1:17 there would be fourteen races from Abraham to David.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>2 We cannot arbitrarily change the word because we encounter some difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>3 If it were the word "race," then "this generation shall by no means pass away until" would indicate that the Jewish race can become extinct.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This can never be.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord Himself was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What then is the explanation of genea?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should seek proofs from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>According to Psalm 12:7, "this generation" means the moral condition of a people; it is not a physical generation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The generation in Deuteronomy 32:5 is not thirty or forty years or a lifetime, but the period in which the condition of crookedness and perversity lasts.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That is how long the generation lasts.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the perversity is not taken away, it will continue to be the crooked generation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In Deuteronomy 32:20 the word "generation" is genea in the Septuagint.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Proverbs 30:11-14 says, "There is a generation."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Obviously, this does not refer to a lifetime or a few years; it refers to a period of time characterized by its moral climate.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In what follows there is light also.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In Matthew 11:16 and 12:39, 41 the sin of "this generation" refers to all the wicked and adulterous people of the past and future put together; thus, the generation lasts as long as the wicked and adulterous ones last.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Matthew 12:42, 45 and 23:36 also contain the word "generation" genea .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, the meaning of 24:34 is that before this wicked, adulterous, perverse, and crooked generation will pass away, all these things will have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The generations in Matthew 1:17 refer to people, not to people's morality; hence, it is different from "generation" in verse 34.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>"This generation" includes three kinds of people: 1 the Gentiles who worship idols and reject God, 2 the Jews who reject Christ, and 3 the apostates, the modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Before these people pass away, all the tribulations must be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord Himself will cast these things away.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Before the kingdom comes, all these things shall be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The kingdom comes after this generation passes away.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In the Scriptures cosmos should be translated "world"; aeon, "age"; and genea, "generation."</S>
