   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGN OF BROTHERLY LOVE IN FOOT-WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's washing the disciples' feet was a matter of love to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After He washed their feet, He charged them to do the same to one another: "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you may do also" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To wash one another's feet, therefore, is a matter of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The commandment to love one another is the unique commandment in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This commandment was first given in John 13, the chapter on foot-washing: "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another" v. 34 . The commandment to wash one another's feet is related to the commandment to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today Christians talk a great deal about brotherly love, yet not many realize that brotherly love is expressed in foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not have the reality of foot-washing, we actually do not have brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we love one another, we need to wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without foot-washing, there is no brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus loved His disciples to the uttermost, and this love is seen in His washing their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we also need to love the brothers in washing their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you are wondering what we mean by foot-washing, since it is not our intention to become a foot-washing group, a group that has the requirement of practicing literal foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I think that the best way to explain what we mean by foot-washing is to use an illustration from our experience in Shanghai in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In two consecutive meetings of a conference a particular sister prayed in an offensive, unseemly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the leading ones felt that in her praying this sister went too far, overstepping others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After she prayed this way the second time, we felt that we could no longer tolerate the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As some of us were fellowshipping after the meeting, we were wondering what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Watchman Nee asked me to write a note to that sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In that note we pointed out to her that in her prayer she had gone too far.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In love we asked her not to pray that way again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We closed the note with the words, "The Lord's grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This letter was then signed by Brother Nee, an elderly sister who was a co-worker, and me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The person to whom that note was addressed was Brother Nee's mother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the note was delivered, I was concerned about what the result would be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The next evening we were again meeting together, this time before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That elderly sister came to the door and spoke one sentence to us: "Foot-washing is good, but the water was too hot!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then she walked away to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The note that was written to that sister is an illustration of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This loving activity can be found only in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In human society, including organized religion, there is no such thing as foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In both secular and religious society, people behave in a political way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of foot-washing, there is backbiting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People may be nice to you, but they may criticize you behind your back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one will wash your feet, and neither will you wash someone else's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to be a member of a denomination, there is no need to practice genuine foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is sufficient to be well-mannered and polite.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, those who behave in such a way may be filled with complaints about others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This should not be our practice in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are political in the church life, we are through with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If instead of washing one another's feet we are polite and political, the defilement on us will make fellowship impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Neither in secular society nor in religious society is there fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the church life requires fellowship, a fellowship that is crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only by foot-washing can our fellowship with God and with one another be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose we in Shanghai had done nothing about our feelings concerning the way that elderly sister prayed in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose we had said nothing, and kept the feeling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we had done that, that feeling eventually would have destroyed the fellowship between us and that sister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, our fellowship with God would have been frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because of the lack of foot-washing, there is not proper fellowship among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of being crystal clear, the situation is opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, certain feelings are concealed within the hearts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, there is no crystal clear fellowship among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such believers may not even be in the outer court of the tabernacle.</S>
