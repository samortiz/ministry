   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When God created Adam, He did not tell him that he had to do certain things to please God or to glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Instead, God put man in front of the tree of life and told him to be careful to eat the right thing Gen 2:8-9, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That means that man had to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Besides the tree of life, there was another tree, the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man has to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he eats the wrong thing, the tree of knowledge, surely he will die v. 17 . It is not a matter of right or wrong, good or bad; it is a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you eat the right thing, you get life; if you eat the wrong thing, you get death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has no intention to ask you to do something right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The right thing and the wrong thing are in different categories according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But to God both right and wrong are in the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tree of life is one category and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, God classifies good and evil in the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may think religiously that your good is really good, but God says, "Your good is just as bad as your evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I never credit your good to your account; I always debit your good to your account just like I debit your evil."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Good and evil are not on the credit side, but on the debit side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has no intention to care for good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's intention is just to care for life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All that you need is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us use a dog as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether this is a good dog or a bad dog, it is still a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it is naughty or it behaves, it is still a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When it is dirty, it is a dog; when it is clean, it is still a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its life and nature have not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, whether we are good or bad, our life and nature are still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we have to give up the religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention is that He may come into man as another life to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention to ask you to do good, just as He has no intention to ask you to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His intention is just to ask you to take Him in as life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only He as life within us can express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot express God; only God Himself can express God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We think that God is someone over us, above us, beside us, or behind us to support, help, and sustain us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a sense, this is not wrong, but this is not God's central way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's central way is to get into man to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why God made things so simple by putting man in front of the tree of life.</S>
