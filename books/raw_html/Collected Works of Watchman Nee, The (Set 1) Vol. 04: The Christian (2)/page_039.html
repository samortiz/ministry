<P>Now, as far as the church is concerned, the "first" love does not refer only to the love of an individual saint when he first believes in the Lord. The "first" here is not just a matter of time. This word is translated as "best" in Luke 15:22. In other places the word is translated as "the most" or "the first." The first love, then, is the best love. The "first" does not refer only to time but to the nature as well. The first love is not only the zeal and diligence of a new believer. It is also the virgin love the saints offer to the Lord as a result of His love. The first love of a church is the union in love between it and its Head. It is moved by the Lord's love to work and to serve. This is the result of the prayer of Ephesians 3:14-19: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" (vv. 17-19). The first love is the love by which the believers single-heartedly turn to Christ through their gratitude for the love and grace of redemption. The cross is the birthplace of the first love. If we forget the Lord's love to us, we will become lacking in our love to Him. What makes us love the Lord is the love of the Lord. His love begets our love. His love draws out our love. "For the love of Christ constrains us,..and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" (2 Cor. 5:14-15). When we trace back the source of our salvation, we will preserve the zeal of our first love. What we are lacking is not the love to the Lord. We have already had this love from the beginning. What we are lacking is the ability to preserve this love. In passing through the evil world, it is difficult for us not to be defiled by the dust on our feet. If we have the Lord's presence with us all the time, the basin and the wash towel of the Lord will do their work, and the pilgrim will not be defiled by worldliness. Only those who are before the Lord can preserve their love for the Lord. If we daily receive His ministration, and we daily draw near to Him, how can we become cold towards Him? If we do, it means that we do not have a personal knowledge of the Lord. It is a pity that many believers never have a personal sentiment towards the Lord. Their Lord is but the Lord in the mouth of the preachers or in the heart of their spiritual friends. They themselves have never fellowshipped with the Lord. Those Christians who know the love of the cross should keep themselves before the Lord and allow the eternally fresh cross to ever refresh and attract them in their hearts.</P><P>One thing which surprises us is that while the Ephesians were in such a condition of leaving their first love, they could still have so many activities, so much zeal, diligence, and forbearance for sufferings. Actually, this should come as no surprise. Although there are still fruits on the tree, they are not as tasty as before. They are not ripened in the heat of the day. The posture, beauty, and color are still there, but these ones do not seek after the love of Christ in the same way that they did before! The outward labor continues to be the same, but the goal is no longer the same! The danger for a saint is that he would not change his outward habit of loving the Lord but would lose his inward heart of the first love. I would rather see a person stop his first work after he has left his first love. If he does this, he can still realize his own failure and can still be alarmed in his heart, realizing that he has fallen and should repent and be recovered. The most dangerous thing is for saints not to be in the Lord's light, who, not having seen any light, assume that everything is just as before and that there is no danger of separation from the Lord in their spiritual life, not knowing that in the deepest part of their hearts they have lost the fellowship of intense love between them and the Lord.</P><P>The one thing I fear the most is that we would often forget about the Lord in our work; we would not know why we are working, laboring, and enduring. Although many works are of the Lord, for whom are we working? I am afraid that many times we work randomly and have not remembered the Lord. The Lord wants us to ask ourselves for whom the works are. It is a pity that we would work out of our habit or out of an intention to retain our fame, rather than out of the prompting of the Lord's love! In that day, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will surely not be praised for the greatness or volume of our work. His flaming eyes will not be after those things. What He will investigate is how much of what we do is out of our love to Him. Only those works that are motivated by love are the gold, the silver, and the precious stones. No matter how great and numerous are the other works, and no matter how zealously and diligently one applies himself to them, they are but the wood, hay, and stubble. They have no use except to be burned. May all our works be done as if they were done before the judgment seat. May the degree of the Lord's judgment on us shine brighter day by day, and may it expose our intention.</P><P>Those who have tasted the Lord's love are in greater danger. When the saints are filled with the first love of the Lord, everything they do originates from their love for the Lord. They have no intention other than this motive. At such times, they feel that they can almost touch the Lord. They are willing to sacrifice their eyes and even their hearts for the Lord. However, when circumstances change, the enticement of the beauty of the world and the urge of the inner cravings subconsciously cool down the former zeal of love! We may still be able to do what we did yesterday, but the motive has changed. Although we are still able to continue with many works, there is no more stirring of the Lord's love in us. In many peoples' experience, they have not totally left the love of Christ. They still know that Christ loves them and that they love Christ. Yet this matter seems to be very hazy. It is like looking through a veil. The Lord's love is no longer as fresh and constraining as before. They only remember the Lord's former love in their memory. The Lord's love is no longer a present attraction. All of a sudden, the clear sky and the bright sun are instead covered by dark clouds! Of course, I do not mean that we should feel the love of the Lord in our emotion every day. This is impossible. But it is another matter if we do not care for the love of the Lord or for loving Him. The Lord's demand for us to hold on to the first love means that we should consider His love to be forever fresh. Although it pleases Him for us to love Him and to taste of His love once, this will not satisfy Him. In the same way a couple begins their marriage with love, the Lord wants us to continue in this kind of love. To borrow a human expression, the Lord wants us to have an eternal "honeymoon" with Him. The many works, labor, and endurance will not satisfy Him. Even perfect works, labor, and endurance, unless they are done in His love, will not be approved by Him either.</P>
