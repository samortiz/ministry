   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ATTRACTING THE OCCUPIED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the remainder of this message we shall consider 5:1-11, a case of the Man-Savior s attracting the occupied ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 5:1 says, Now it came about as the crowd pressed upon Him and listened to the word of God, that He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gennesaret was a common name for the Sea of Galilee Matt 4:18; Mark 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fallen Man Occupied with Making a Living</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The calling of the first four disciples was a calling that attracted the occupied ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Human beings do not realize how much they are fallen not only in sin but also in their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our occupation is our business or means of employment, that is, our means of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today fallen human beings are occupied by their way of making their living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say that fallen human beings are occupied by their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, it is necessary for us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul charged the believers to work for a living 2 Thes 3:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not rely on others to provide a living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that we should not have the kind of faith that requires others to exercise their love and take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to have a means of employment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the problem is that our occupation occupies us and keeps us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Human beings were created by God for Himself, but they are occupied and kept from Him by the matter of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing takes people away from God as much as their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consider today s world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who is not occupied by his job or by the education in preparation for work?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although most people are busy, hardly anyone is busy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, virtually everyone is occupied by something in place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first disciples were called and attracted by the Lord not from their sinful life, but from their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In particular, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were occupied with fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are occupied with making a living usually give excuses when invited to hear the gospel or to attend a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you invite such a one to hear the gospel, he may say that he does not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you invite an occupied person to attend the meeting of the church, he may say that he is too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the reason that, immediately after beginning to carry out His fourfold commission, the Man-Savior in 5:1-11 did something to attract certain occupied ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan s desire is to keep people occupied with making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is illustrated by what Pharaoh did to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Moses told Pharaoh to let God s people go, Pharaoh did his best to keep them occupied with their labors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a similar way, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were busy and occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus came to them, attracted them, and called them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Miracles Related to Fishing</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 5:2-10a we have a record of the Man-Savior s attracting some who were occupied with earning a living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This record is not found either in Matthew 4:18-22 or in Mark 1:16-20.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we read Matthew and Mark, we may wonder why Peter and the others followed the Lord when He told them to come and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here in Luke 5 we have an additional record indicating that when the Lord Jesus called Peter, He performed a miracle related to fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord performed a similar miracle in John 21, after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Luke 5 the miracle was part of the Lord s attracting the occupied ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This miracle attracted Peter to the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A few years later, after the Lord s resurrection, it seemed that Peter had nothing to do, and he announced that he was going fishing John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Several others followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because they returned to their former occupation, the Lord Jesus returned, in resurrection, to perform a second miracle related to fishing in order to attract Peter to Himself again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, twice for Peter s sake the Lord did a miracle related to fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The calling of Peter in Luke 5:1-11 is related to the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 2 says, He saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing the nets.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord then got into Simon s boat and asked him to put out a little from the land v. 3 . He taught the crowds from the boat, and when He had ceased speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch v. 4 . Simon answered, Master, through the whole night we toiled and took nothing; but at Your word I will let down the nets v. 5 . Before this Simon had been brought to the Lord by his brother Andrew John 1:40-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 5 Simon addressed the Lord as Master.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Greek word, a different one from that translated Master in 2:29, denotes one who exercises any kind of oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter was a professional fisherman, the lake had an abundance of fish, and night was the proper time for fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, they did not catch anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It must have been that the Lord exercised His sovereignty to keep the fish away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was an exercise not of His human virtues, but of His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason the Lord exercised His sovereignty in this way was that His intention was to attract Simon and his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, at the proper time, the Lord commanded the fish to come near.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, they enclosed a great number of fish; and their nets were tearing apart v. 6 . Both boats were filled to the point of sinking v. 7 . When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord! v. 8 . We are told that amazement had taken possession of him and all who were with him at the catch of the fish which they took v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The point here is that in this miracle we can see both the Lord s human virtues and His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The human virtues express the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that the Man-Savior was living a life full of the human virtues, and these virtues expressed the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because the Man-Savior lived in this way, Peter and the others were attracted to the Lord and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fishers of Men</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 5:10 the Lord Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men alive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was the Lord s calling of Peter by a miracle in fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Greek word for catch is zogreo, compounded of zoos, living and agreuo, to catch; hence, to catch alive, to take captive alive in war, instead of killing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The common fishermen catch fish unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Peter was called by the Lord to be a fisher of men Matt 4:19 to catch men unto life Acts 2:38; 11:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Luke 5:11 says, And when they had brought the boats to the land, they left all and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They were attracted by what the Lord did in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Luke s intention in 5:1-11 is to show how the Man-Savior acted in His ministry in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This attracts people and gains them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the way the Man-Savior carries out His ministry.</S>
