<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Jesus is today's Moses</H2><P>The Lord Jesus is really wise. Our speech is always so stupid, but the Lord Jesus always speaks in a very simple and pleasing tone. He did not rebuke Peter and tell him that he should not have said yes. The Lord was not so coarse, so rough as we are. He was outside of tradition and religion, but he was nicely outside of them. He asked Peter, "What thinkest thou Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?" (17:25). He spoke very nicely to Peter. Then Peter answered, "From strangers." The Lord Jesus replied, "Therefore the sons are free." He said in effect, "You have already heard on the mountain top that I am the Son of God; therefore, I am free from this tribute. This tribute is collected for my Father's house, and I am the Father's Son; so I am free."</P><P>Then Peter should have said something like this to the Lord: "Oh, I'm sorry, Lord; I should not have said 'yes,' I should have said 'no.' Anyhow, now what shall I do?" When Peter said yes, the Lord Jesus found a way to convince him that it should have been no. However, after Peter was convinced that he should have said no, Jesus said unto him, "But..." (v. 27). You can never beat the Lord Jesus in speaking. "But lest we cause them to stumble,...take, and give unto them for me and thee." When we say yes, the Lord says no, and then when we are convinced to say no, He says yes. The Lord is really troublesome. Eventually what is right and what is wrong? Should it be yes or should it be no? Eventually, there is no right or wrong, no yes or no&#151;only Jesus! With the same case, when you say yes, he may say no, and when you say no, He may say yes. But whatever He says is right. "Hear ye Him!"&#151;"Jesus only!" He is today's Moses; He is today's Lawgiver; He is the law today. There is no more Moses; there is only Jesus. Do not hear what the Old Testament says; hear Him. What would you say? In any case, whatever you say is wrong. Even if you are scriptural, you are still wrong; even if you are fundamental, you are still wrong. It is not a matter of being scriptural or fundamental, but a matter of Christ, a matter of the living, up-to-date, present Jesus. Everything depends on such a One. There is no law, no teaching, no regulations&#151;only Jesus. And not a Jesus in doctrine but a Jesus who is so living, so instant, and so present.</P><P>Some young brothers have been greatly troubled over the matter of a haircut. How should they cut their hair? In what style? I will tell you, go to Jesus and ask Him. See what your living Jesus would say. There is no religion, no culture, no regulation, only Jesus.</P><P>In the summer of 1969 there was quite an influx of ex-hippies into the church in Los Angeles. They came in with long hair, long beards, sandals, and corresponding attire. Some brothers came to me at the time and said, "Brother. be careful, we might end up being a 'hippie' church." I answered them that I do not stand on either side: I am not for the hippies, and I am not against the hippies. Today it is not a matter of right or wrong, but absolutely a matter of the living, up-to-date Jesus. When He says, "Long hair!" then you may leave your hair long. When He says, "Short hair!" then you must cut your hair. When you go for a haircut, just say, "O Lord Jesus, how long?" Then you will know how long. Ask the Lord, "O Lord Jesus, what style?" Then you will know what style.</P><P>I would say a word in regard to the sisters and their skirts. I do not know how long is long and how short is short. You go to the presence of Jesus and ask Him. Jesus is within you; see what He says. You will know; the living Jesus will tell you. If you go to the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is not one verse to tell you how long your skirts should be. You must go to the living Jesus. Do not argue and reason&#151;go to Jesus.</P><P>Some like to make laws for themselves, and some like to make laws for others. Immediately they become today's Moses. Do not make laws for yourselves, and do not make any laws for others. Hear ye Him!</P><P>When it came to the application, Peter not only forgot Christ, but also his brothers. When the tribute men came, if I were Peter and had learned my lesson, I would have called the Lord and my other brothers James and John and asked them to deal with the tribute men. Then I would have received the help I needed. You see, this is the Body life. Peter saw the vision, but Peter forgot the whole thing. With Peter there was no Christ, no Church, no Head, and no Body&#151;only Peter himself. This is our problem. Today, in all our situations, we must remember our Head and also the members of the Body. Do not say yes or no, do not say anything, do not make any decisions until you have come to the Head and also to the Body. We are so accustomed to being individualistic.</P>
