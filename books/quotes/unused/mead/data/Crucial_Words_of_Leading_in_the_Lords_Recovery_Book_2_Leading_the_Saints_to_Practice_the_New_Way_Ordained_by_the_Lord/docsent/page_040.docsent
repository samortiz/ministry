   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN ORDER TO HAVE A REVELATION, A PERSON NEEDING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO KNOW THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The requirement concerning revelation is even higher, because a revelation is God making known the intent of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 25:14 says, The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Intimate counsel carries a sense of revelation, indicating that if we want to receive God s revelation, we must be those who draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are those who draw near to God, contact Him, and are joined to Him, we will be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are joined to the Lord in spirit, we will surely receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation is different from teaching and is deeper than teaching; it requires us to be those who draw near to God, fellowship with God, be one spirit with the Lord every day, and labor on the Bible continually; if we are such persons, God will reveal much to us through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of revelation does not necessarily come to us in the church meetings but is obtained through our reading the Word and praying at home during our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation primarily enables us to know the mystery of God, which in the New Testament is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This New Testament economy consists mainly of two great mysteries: the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Christ and the church are the two great mysteries in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not a teaching; it is altogether a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person does not receive this kind of revelation by memorizing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person may be familiar with the Bible and adept in linking together verses in the Bible, yet he may not have any revelation or light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that we will not necessarily have light simply because we are familiar with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having light is altogether a matter of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible is a great book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Though people may expound it using their wild imagination, it never loses its greatness and authenticity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was born into fundamental and organized Christianity and read a number of books after I was saved; nevertheless, it was not until I met the Brethren that I began to know some of the fundamental and accurate truths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The truth that the Brethren taught was pure and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a great adjustment and cleansing for me, allowing me to become clear concerning all the improper doctrines that I had received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, I came into contact with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was a person who knew the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both of us had contacted what fundamental Christianity passed down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the history of Christianity from the sixth century to the sixteenth century, a total of ten centuries, the Roman Catholic Church locked up the Bible, causing the church to fall into the Dark Ages, an age without God s word, revelation, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the 1500s Martin Luther rose up to introduce some reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prior to Luther, people such as John Wycliffe and John Huss had already begun the work of reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The state churches and private churches that were produced by the Reformation were all orthodox.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in the eighteenth century, John Wesley rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, in the southern part of Germany Count Zinzendorf opened his estate to the Lord s believers because of his love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This resulted in the producing of the Moravian Brethren and brought in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A century later, the British Brethren were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the Brethren groups were orthodox.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the interval the mystics were also raised up, and they too were orthodox.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, William Law made mysticism practical and brought in the matter of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have inherited everything orthodox from the past nineteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Bible exposition has its unchanging principles, which have been established through the studies by Bible scholars throughout the generations over the past nineteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must solemnly say that through our collecting and compiling work, most of these riches have been crystallized in the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we read the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament carefully from beginning to end, we will see that all the principles are contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These principles form the standard that secures our understanding, comprehension, and expounding of the Bible so that we would not stray from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These principles also apply in our expounding of the prophecies, types, plain texts, and history of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the Bible is the revelation of the mystery of God, our application of these principles will preserve us from straying off.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In summary, in order to receive a revelation we must be proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our being must be right, and we must be those who seek the Lord Himself and are able to teach something.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the minimum requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, we must advance further.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only must we be right, but we must also know the spirit and have deep fellowship with the Lord in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we need to be teachers who are able to teach something and prophets who are able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In prophesying, we speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A large part of prophesying consists of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, the praise offered by Mary is a prophecy, but it is also full of light and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She said, My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior Luke 1:46-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This word is a word of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to prophesy in such a way, our person must not only be right, but our spirit must also maintain close fellowship with the Lord.</S>
