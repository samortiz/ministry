<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>As the Organism of the Triune God,<br>Being Also the Fullness, the Expression,<br>of the Consummated Triune God</H2><P>Eventually this Body of Christ becomes the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God. Ephesians 3:19 says that we are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God. The fullness is the expression and the issue of the dispensing of all the riches of Christ. The husky Americans are the fullness, the expression, of all the riches of America. In the same way, the Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God as the issue, the result, of the riches of Christ constituted into all the members. Today our God has been consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit. He is available to us for us to enjoy, for us to participate in. By enjoying His riches in Christ as the Spirit, we may become His fullness to express Him in this universe.</P><P>So at the end of Ephesians 3 Paul said, "To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen" (v. 21). Through the Body of Christ as the fullness of the processed Triune God, God can have an expression in the whole universe. The Triune God is fully expressed and fully represented through the Body of Christ as His organism.</P><P>5 brothers</P>
