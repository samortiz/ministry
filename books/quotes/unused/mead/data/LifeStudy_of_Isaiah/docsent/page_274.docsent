   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. As the God-man, in His Humanity,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Begotten of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His resurrection Christ as the God-man, in His humanity, was begotten of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before His resurrection Christ was the Son of God already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why then did He need to be begotten of God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The answer is that before His resurrection, Christ was the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only so, when He was the only begotten Son, He was only divine; He was not human.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had only divinity; He did not have humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had only the divine nature without the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through incarnation He became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the aspect of His being God, He no doubt was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in the aspect of His being a man, He was not divine before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His resurrection He "sonized" His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before His resurrection He was the Son of God in His divinity, but He was not the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Acts 13:33 tells us that Christ's resurrection was a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His resurrection He was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ's resurrection was a great birth, a great delivery, of a corporate child, which includes Christ and all His believers John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He as the Son of Man was born of God to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, as the firstborn Son of God, He is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He possesses two natures: the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hebrews 1:6 says that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not come as the Only Begotten but as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also is the produce of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ's resurrection produced the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ as the firstborn Son of God is a model for conforming many sons to His image Rom 8:29a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If He were not human, how could we, who are human, be conformed to His image?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He were not human, He would not have a human image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But today He is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is God in God's form, in God's image, and He is also man in man's form, in man's image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is divine and human, and we are human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we can be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the model; we are the mass production, the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, Christ's resurrection also produced many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>D. As the Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regenerating All His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His resurrection Christ as the resurrection life regenerated all His believers 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ's believers are His brothers, and His brothers are the many sons of God Heb 2:10a, 11b-12; Rom 8:29b .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way Christ has become our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the firstborn Son of God, and He has made us the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The many sons of God are the members of God's household to be God's kingdom Eph 2:19; Gal 6:10 and God's precious inheritance Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before Christ's resurrection God had a home, but in that home there were no children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Christ's resurrection, God, in a sense, was childless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was through Christ's resurrection that God begot the firstborn Son and the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, from that time God began to have a family, a household.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, this household becomes God's kingdom, and the children of God, the household of God, become God's precious inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As God's many sons, we are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God considers only us, His sons, as His inheritance.</S>
