<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 30, 1948, Friday, 6:30 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE ONE TALENT IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Chi Yung-tung: What does the one talent in the Bible (Matt. 25:15) refer to?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The one talent refers to the gift that the believers receive through the Lord's redemption. Today the church fails because the one-talented ones have failed. If all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested, and others will see what the Body is. Every redeemed one has at least one talent; no one can have less than one talent.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING COORDINATION IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for Arrangements</h2><p>Chu Cheng: Is the coordination of the Body something spontaneous, or is there some kind of arrangement?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Strictly speaking, our coordination before the Lord should be something spontaneous, but the problem today is that the young ones do not see the matter of coordination. This is why the brothers ahead of them should make some arrangements.</p><p>In the Epistles to Timothy, Paul did not leave one thing for Timothy to make his own decision about. He only required that Timothy and those with him be obedient. Today if we do not make any arrangements, many people will not coordinate together.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission Helping a Person<br />to Break through His Individual Limitations</h2><p>There are certain advantages to being coordinated. All of our judgments before the Lord are based on the light that we have received. The amount of light we see determines the amount of judgment we have. During the first few years of their Christian life, many people do not see much light. Their work and conduct surely cannot exceed the light they see. Hence, their work and conduct are limited by their judgments, and their judgments are limited by the light they have received. At Pentecost the church became a strong testimony in an instant. Hence, as far as the church is concerned, it has been strong since the first day. But as far as the individuals are concerned, their condition progresses as time goes on. If the young ones accept the judgments of the older ones, they will be able to do things beyond their capacity, and all the services before the Lord will be covered properly. In this way the church will gain a profit. If all the one-talented ones will submit to authority, they will not remain with one talent; rather, they will make a profit. We have to see that the riches in the church far exceed the riches of individual members.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FOLLOWING THE MINISTRY OF THE AGE</h2><h2 class="head2">Seeing the Ministry of the Age</h2><p>Question: How should Jonathan in the Old Testament (Saul's son&mdash;1 Sam. 14:1-46) have chosen his way?</p><p>Watchman Nee: In the Old Testament both Solomon and David represented the Lord. The two persons represented the one ministry in two separate ways. In the Old Testament there were many ministries. After Moses, the judges were raised up. After that, there was Solomon, the kings, and the prophets. After the Israelites were taken into captivity, the vessels for the recovery were raised up. The Old Testament is filled with different kinds of ministries. In every age there is the ministry of that age. These ministries of the ages are different from the local ministers. Luther was a minister of his age. Darby was also a minister of his age. In every age the Lord has special things that He wants to accomplish. He has His own recoveries and His own works to do. The particular recovery and work that He does in one age is the ministry of that age.</p>
