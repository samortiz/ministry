Since the Lord is the place that is filled with the glory of God, what He did for the glory of God was guiltless. The Lord is greater than the priests and also greater than the temple. The Lord said that He was David; this refers to His person. The Lord said that He was the priest and the temple; this refers to His work. By replacing the Sabbath with His person and His work, the Lord altogether put aside the Sabbath. If the problem of sin is not solved, there can be no rest. As long as the Lord was still being rejected, and as long as the people in the world were still in sin, there could not be a Sabbath. The Lord was saying that as long as He was David and the temple, His disciples could profane the Sabbath.</P><P>Verse 7:"I desire mercy and not sacrifice." This is a conclusion, indicating that God does not want men to do something for Him, but He wants to do something for men. "Mercy" is what God gives to men, whereas "sacrifice" is what men give to God.</P><P>Verse 8:"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." From this we can see that until today, men still do not know the Lord of the Sabbath.</P><P>Verses 1-50 may be divided into seven small sections: (1) verses 1-13, the question of the Sabbath; (2) verses 14-21, the first time the Pharisees took counsel to destroy Jesus; (3) verses 22-32; (4) verses 33-37; (5) verses 38-42; (6) verses 43-45; (7) verses 46-50.</P><P>Chapter twelve is a transitional chapter; therefore, it is of the utmost importance. Beginning from chapter twelve, the destiny of the Jews is decided. This chapter is crucial in terms of the dispensations. If we fail to see the Lord's turn in this chapter, we are inexperienced in understanding the Word. Prior to this chapter the Lord was evidently for the Jews and hiddenly for the Gentiles. After chapter twelve He was clearly for the Gentiles and hinted that He was rejecting the Jews. Chapter twelve is a turning point, a transitional chapter; this is why there is the need to overthrow one thing-the Sabbath. In type, it is all right to have the Sabbath; in actuality, it is not permissible. Men have sinned, so that even God has no rest. Man does not have rest because God has no rest. Wherever sin is, there cannot be rest.</P><P>From verses 1 through 8 there are two turns-from David to the king, and from the king to the Lord.</P><P>Verse 9:Here is another case of violating the Sabbath among the Pharisees.</P><P>Verse 10:"And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him." A "withered hand" is a hand that can do nothing. Here, the man was not without a hand; rather, he had a withered hand. The form was still there, but the strength was gone. All men are exactly like this: they are dead spiritually, but they are still human beings.</P><P>Verses 11-12:The Lord did not reply as to whether or not it was lawful; instead, He asked them two questions. When the Lord was confronted with difficult questions, He did not answer first but responded with a question. All truths can stand questioning. Whatever is not the truth cannot stand questioning. The Pharisees talked about men; the Lord talked about sheep. The Pharisees talked about the withered hand; the Lord talked about the sheep falling into a pit.</P><P>Man treasures material possessions but despises sinners; he treasures sheep but despises men. What the Lord meant was that as long as the world remains, there will be pits, and there will be sheep falling into pits. The only way for the Lord was to take hold of the sheep and lift it out. "To do well on the Sabbath" does not point to a particular matter; it speaks of a principle. The Lord always speaks in this way.</P><P>Verse 13:"Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand." This is the Lord's action. "And he stretched it out." The man acted according to the Lord's word. Life is behind the word of God. God's word is like a capsule filled with medicine, and life is likened to the medicine contained in the capsule. When one swallows the capsule, he swallows the medicine at the same time. Likewise, when one receives the word of God, he also receives the life of God at the same time. There is no word of God that is without power. This means that there is not one word behind which there is no life. The hand was "restored." This shows that the work of Christ is complete. When the life of a sinner is restored, he receives a life that is better than what he had in Adam.</P><P>Verses 14 to 21 form the second subsection.</P><P>Verse 14:"But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him." This was the Pharisees' plotting to destroy Jesus. The reason for this was that the Lord broke the Sabbath. The Pharisees considered that if the Sabbath was broken, Israel would not be reckoned as God's chosen people. The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant that God had made with Israel. Once this sign was removed, the covenant would become ineffective. The Pharisees knew the Lord's attitude toward the Israelites, that is, to put the Israelites aside. Because the foundation was overthrown by the Lord, the Pharisees wanted to kill Him.</P><P>Verse 15:"But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all." The Lord "withdrew from there"; He did not run away. On another occasion the Lord "passing through their midst, went away" (Luke 4:30). He went away as if nothing had happened. Such calmness is unmatched. "He healed them all," indicating that He took care of all those who had needs.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
