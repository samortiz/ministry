   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 10:43 Everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Practice of Dealing with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two aspects with regard to the object of dealing with sins: one is the record of sin before God, and the other is the actual deed of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our Lord bore for us the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His blood satisfied the requirement of God's law on our behalf; therefore, all our record of sin before God has been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if this objective fact is to become our subjective experience, there is still the need of application.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will speak of this application by dividing it into two stages: before we are saved and after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Acts 10:43 the abolishing of our record of sin before we are saved depends upon our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The words in 1 John 1:9 were written by the apostle to those who are saved, and they refer to all the sins we commit after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The abolishing of our record of sin after we are saved depends upon our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the application is through our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How should we deal with the actual committing of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have offended God we must deal with it before God and ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have sinned against man, we should deal with it before man by asking man's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we deal with sins before man, there are four basic principles we should remember and by which we should abide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Irrespective of the sin with which we are dealing and regardless of how we deal with it, we should always take care of these four principles by asking: 1 Will this dealing dispel the discordant condition between others and ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2 Will it cause our conscience to be clean and void of offense?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3 Will it enable us to testify to the salvation of God and thereby give Him glory?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4 And can we benefit others by it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the answers to these questions conform to the four principles, we may bravely proceed then to deal with the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If, however, one of the answers does not conform to one of these principles, we should be careful; otherwise, the enemy will take advantage of our dealing and use it to produce an opposite result.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order that our dealings be properly and soundly carried out to the end that God may be glorified, that we obtain grace, and that others be benefitted, we shall now discuss a few technical points in accordance with the four principles we have mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, the object of our dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should go to whomever we have offended and deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have sinned only against God, we deal with God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have sinned against God and man, we deal with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not necessary to deal with those against whom we have not sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our dealing should not exceed the sphere of the sin which we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the safe way to obtain peace within and not harm others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the circumstance of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have sinned openly, we deal with it openly; if we have sinned secretly, we deal with it secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sin we have committed in private does not require our dealing with it in public.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Third, the responsibility of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we deal with sins, we should only deal with that part for which we are responsible; never involve others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I should not expose what others have done and cause them difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fourth, the reimbursing of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the sin we have committed involves material things or the gain of others, we should make restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament, in Leviticus 5, it is stated that one fifth should be added.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament we have the example of Zaccheus Luke 19 restoring fourfold to those whom he had cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These are not laws or regulations, but principles and examples to show us that whenever we make restitution, we should add something to the original value.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>104</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
