   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH AS CHRIST S COUNTERPART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is also Christ s counterpart, His wife Eph 5:25-27, 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church as the counterpart of Christ implies satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every husband needs satisfaction and rest, which are found in love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers who are husbands can testify that our satisfaction and rest can only be in our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we say that we are the church, then we must ask if Christ has His rest among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not be so quick to claim that you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be the church is to render to Christ the adequate satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ needs such a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is not merely a gathering of God s called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a satisfaction and rest to Christ in love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE CHURCH AS THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To God the Spirit, the church is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 3:16 says, Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believers as a corporate unit in a certain locality are the temple indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, to God the Spirit we are the temple filled with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not simply a matter of having the manifestations of certain gifts, such as healing and speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a matter of having the corporate indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHURCH AS THE ARMY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To the enemy, Satan, the church is an army Eph 6:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being the army is not an individualistic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At most, you and I can only be soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But all the soldiers must be formed and constituted into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we are detached from the army, we are in a very dangerous situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have the protection of being in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because many Christians today are not in the army, they are constantly under the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is absolutely a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the aspects of the church we have covered sonship, family, Body, counterpart, temple, and army are corporate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition to all these aspects, the church is also the new man Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church as the new man is for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah, on earth there is such a new man living here!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To the Father, the church is the sonship and the family; to the Son, the church is the Body and the counterpart; to the Spirit, the church is the temple; to Satan, the church is the army; and for our living the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that we are the new man!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Individualistically we are not the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has one corporate new man the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After seeing all these aspects of the church, can we still be individualistic?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify that after I saw all this, my individualism was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have seen that the church is absolutely a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With respect to the Father, to the Son, to the Spirit, to the enemy, and for our living, the church is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, the church is the sonship, the family, the Body, the counterpart, the temple, the army, and the one new man!</S>
