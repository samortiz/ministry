<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WORK IN KULING AND<br />THE WORK THROUGHOUT CHINA</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: September 8, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><p>I feel that we should let the brothers and sisters know as soon as possible about the way ahead of them. Some are still not clear about what to do, while others are clear already. Those who do not know can pray to the Lord. If you do not have a clear guidance from the Lord, you should let us know as soon as possible. Let me talk a little about the work here in Kuling and also about the work throughout China. I have considered dividing our work into ten divisions or regions. At least one or two of these regions have made a start already.</p><p>1) Shanghai region: This includes the area along the Shanghai-Hangchow railway. The center is Shanghai.</p><p>2) Foochow region: This takes care of Fukien province and Taiwan province. The center is Foochow. Northern Fukien and southwestern Fukien are not included in this region.</p><p>3) Wenchow region: Northern Fukien is part of this region. There is a definite need to have a start in this region. There are well over a hundred churches in this region.</p><p>Our strength lies in the clarity of the teaching concerning the ground of locality. Our weakness lies in the fact that our work does not have a center. There was no interruption in our meetings even during the war years because we were clear about the ground of locality. Although we did not have pastors and preachers, we were able to carry on with the breaking of bread, worship, and preaching. However, we became scattered because we did not have a center for the work. We admit that the mistake is on our part. We are willing to face this mistake. Now we have seen clearly from the Bible that there are regions to the work.</p><p>4) Peking-Tientsin region: We hope that a region will be raised up in northern China, including Peking and Tientsin. We hope that gradually this region will be extended to Shansi, Suiyuen, Ningshia, and even to Inner Mongolia.</p><p>Before the war there were four million Catholics in China but less than six hundred thousand Protestants. After the war, there were three million Catholics, while the Protestants numbered about four hundred and eighty thousand, or slightly less than five hundred thousand. Although there has been a slight decrease, the decrease is not significant. Many were lost during these years. (The above numbers also include the nominal ones.) Thirty percent of the Catholics are living in Inner Mongolia. Their work extends westward towards Shansi.</p><p>5) Tsingtao region: This region extends west of the Jiao-Ji Railway and south of the Jin-Pu Railway.</p><p>6) Canton region: This is the southern China region. Canton is the center; it includes Hong Kong. The further one moves south in this region, the more unstable the situation becomes. The people are less dependable, and the testimony is less promising. This region bears the responsibility of both Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces.</p><p>7) Hakka region: When we were at Custom Lane, we felt the need to have Swatow as a center. There are over thirty assemblies in southwestern Kiangsi and southeastern Fukien. We can even count southwestern Fukien as part of this region.</p><p>8) The literature work: The literature work, such as the publishing of books and periodicals, is considered a separate unit of the work. Such works are handled by Shanghai.</p><p>9) The work in Kuling: The work in Kuling is also separate. It is situated in Foochow.</p><p>10) Itinerant preaching: In the past we paid much attention to the local churches. This is the line of Antioch; yet we forgot about the line of Jerusalem. Today we have to pay equal attention to the Jerusalem line and the Antioch line. During the past few months we have been dealing with personal spiritual problems. From now on, we have to deal with the Lord concerning our work. If any of us has any kind of feeling at all, please let us know so that together we can make the proper decisions.</p><p>The work among these ten areas is not that simple. We are short both in manpower and in finances. Let us consider again in detail the work in these ten areas.</p>
