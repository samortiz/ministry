<p>After meeting with the new ones in this way, we should bring them to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting and to the small group meeting. This is the third step. If several households in a neighborhood are saved, we can introduce them to one another and help them to visit one another. Then we should help them gather together for a small group meeting. There is no need to make arrangements in advance concerning the time to meet or in whose house to meet. We should drop the old traditional, legalistic way of doing things. If a few families cannot meet together at one time, two households can meet together. This is a sufficient number to begin a small group meeting. We need to break through all the forms of worship to have new and living meetings.</p>
<p>In the small groups the first thing we should do is fellowship with one another. We must lead the new ones into fellowshipping together. When everyone comes together, we must fellowship by asking others questions and answering questions concerning ourselves. After the fellowship we should pray and then visit another household. The small group meeting should begin in one home and end in a second home. When we knock on the door of the second home, we can begin singing a hymn while we are still standing outside the door. This will cause the people inside to have a spontaneous response. This is true morale. When everyone is sitting down, we can fellowship about the problems we encountered that day and pray for one another. After the prayer we should help the new ones to care for one another. For example, if someone is sick, we should pray for him and show concern for his health. This is the way to care for one another. If anyone has any questions after this, everyone can participate to answer the questions. Such meetings will not be stiff and formal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should not wait for anyone to take the lead in the small group meetings, nor should we wait for others to begin speaking. Every person can speak; hence, there is no need to make any arrangements or follow any rituals. Everyone should function organically. After fellowshipping, we must pray. Prayer will produce an atmosphere of mutual care. If there are any questions, everyone should participate in answering the questions. No specific person should answer all the questions; rather, every attendant in the meeting can say something. If the new ones wait for us to answer the question, we should encourage them to answer the question and not wait for us. When we do respond, we should be brief and speak clearly. We must avoid having one person give the entire answer. If only one person answers a question, he will occupy the entire meeting, and others will not have the opportunity to speak. Hence, every person should only take about three minutes to answer a question. After one person speaks, another person should add something, and then another can add more. In this way, everyone will have an opportunity to speak, and the riches within the saints will spontaneously come forth.</p>
<p>We must develop the habit of allowing everyone to speak freely and to exercise his spirit. This requires much learning. Even though we use the term <em>small group,</em> it is possible that we do not have the proper understanding of a small group. The local churches have not fully turned in this matter.</p>
<p>We can learn the truth through the mutual asking of questions in the small group meetings. This will bring in the pursuit of life. This means that the small group meetings have mutual fellowship, mutual prayer, mutual care, mutual learning of the truth, and the mutual pursuit of life. These are the five items of the small group meetings. The content of the small groups is broad and all-inclusive. If a small group meets fifty-two times in one year, and if the members learn something every time they meet, that meeting will spontaneously produce teachers. Furthermore, there should not be too many saints meeting in the small group meetings. At the most there should be twenty people. This will give everyone a chance to function.</p>
<p>A new believer may ask, &ldquo;Why is the Lord Jesus the Lord and Jesus and Christ? What is the meaning of these names?&rdquo; Everyone who is in the meeting should speak a little to answer the question. Perhaps one brother will say, &ldquo;He is the Lord of heaven and earth. He is the Creator; hence, He is the Lord. No founder of a religion has ever dared to call himself the lord. Confucius and Mohammed never dared to say that they were lord because only Jesus is the Lord.&rdquo; Then another brother may add, &ldquo;Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not have a lord. In addition, only believing in the Lord Jesus is called believing in the Lord, because in the entire universe only He is Lord.&rdquo; Then a sister might add, &ldquo;I can testify that before I believed, my husband was unable to be my lord even though he was very good to me. I had to bear so many things by myself. Today I am saved, and I have the Lord; no matter what problem I encounter, the Lord can lead me through it.&rdquo; These words are both testimonies and teachings.</p>
<p>The truth among us is very rich. Another brother may add, &ldquo;The name Jesus means &lsquo;Jehovah the Savior&rsquo; or &lsquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rsquo;&rdquo; Another saint might continue and say, &ldquo;<em>Jesus</em> is the Greek word for the Hebrew word <em>Joshua.</em> Joshua brought the Israelites into the good land of Canaan, where they obtained all the riches of the land. Hence, Jesus is not merely our Savior; He is also our Joshua, who leads us into the good land of Canaan to enjoy all its riches.&rdquo; Then another person may say, &ldquo;<em>Christ</em> means &lsquo;the anointed One.&rsquo; In Greek His name is Christ, and in Hebrew it is Messiah. God anointed Him, so today He is our Lord, our Savior, our Joshua, and our anointed One. All of God&rsquo;s riches are in Him, and because we are members of His Body, His anointing also reaches us.&rdquo; Such short answers are very rich, and they will nourish the new ones and build them up.</p>
<p>Some of the saints among us may have listened to messages for twenty years or more, but they still cannot explain what it means for Jesus to be the Lord or what the name Jesus means. However, after attending such small group meetings, all the saints, regardless of how long they have been saved, will have a clear understanding of what <em>Jesus</em> means and what <em>Christ</em> means. These answers do not merely teach the truth; they also contain the supply of life. At the end of the small group meeting a more experienced brother can add a few words to explain that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, even the embodiment of the processed Triune God. When we speak in this way, we are prophesying. Then in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting we can use three minutes to speak this prophecy again so that all the brothers and sisters will be edified.</p>
<p>Such a small group meeting is different from the small group meetings we held in the past. Those who bear responsibility in the small group meetings can learn how to lead their group according to its condition. If a group lacks new ones, we suggest that the group preach the gospel by knocking on doors in order to gain new ones and have people to visit. By doing this, we promote the gospel. Or we can visit the saints who are ill or the brothers and sisters who have not been in the meetings for a long time. A group meeting can divide into teams in order to visit people. If someone has missed the meeting for two or three weeks, we can arrange for someone in the group to bear the responsibility of caring for him. In general, every aspect in the practice of the church life must be done in the small groups. The potential of the small groups is limitless. If we practice the small groups in this way, we will have the increase; we will preach the gospel, visit people, and care for people. When the number of those attending our small group increases, we can split the group into two smaller groups.</p>
<p>After six months of meeting in this way, the new ones will learn how to meet in the small groups, and they will also be clear about what they need to do. After the group is split and two new groups are established, we can go out and lead more new people to salvation. After another six months we will again be ready to split the group meeting. Then what began as one group meeting will become three or four groups. This is the spread and the increase of the church. In this way the church will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel, having home meetings, and having the small group meetings constitute the church life. After six months of meeting in this way in a small group, everyone will know one another, and we can split the group in order to maintain the freshness. Otherwise, an old flavor may creep into the meeting. If the group is split, the members will still have a fresh relationship when they see one another on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Related to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, there should not be too many saints in the meeting. A meeting with forty or fifty people is large enough. Then the meetings will be fresh and living, and everyone will have many opportunities to function. The gospel teams that go out to the rural places to raise up churches must take this way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
