   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the fifth issue of The Christian published in March 1926:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From now on, the Lord willing, each issue of The Christian will contain a column on "The Signs of the Times" that our readers might better understand the situation in the last days and know how the prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May the Lord use this column to inspire His children to watch and pray and get themselves ready.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Knowing that the Lord is coming soon should not make one lazy, but rather cause him to forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are aware of the Lord's soon return, yet still love the world, are in a very pitiful spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The purpose of The Christian is not to preach any person, any man's ideals, or any "ism."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its mission is to preach the Lord Jesus and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We thank the Lord that this paper has aroused many people's sympathy and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our intention in these pages is to preach the message of the Lord to people far and near.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I deeply believe that if the Lord's servants clearly preach the gospel of the vicarious death of the cross and depend on the mighty power of the Holy Spirit in order that sinners might become regenerated, they will by no means be fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unfortunately, what is preached today is not the gospel of God, the gospel of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, the message of the cross as revealed by God is replaced with man's ideals and rules for improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No wonder sinners are not affected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others preach the salvation of God by their own intelligence and wisdom and do not have the Holy Spirit working with them by power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, even though they preach, in the end they cannot save men's souls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I pray humbly that the Lord may have mercy on us and cause us not to rely on our own ability or strength but rather on God's Spirit to speak forth the gospel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The following is taken from the combined thirteenth and fourteenth issues of The Christian published in January February 1927:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we first began publication of The Christian, our original intention was to try it for only one year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While, on the one hand, there are not many spiritual publications today, on the other hand, there are enough to make us wonder whether there was sufficient need for us to publish The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet, since its inception, readers everywhere have indicated that it does meet a great need in the church today and has its unique place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their subscriptions, recommendations, and encouragement have been continually pouring in. We thank God that He has made The Christian so acceptable to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We intend therefore to continue the work for another year....</S>
