   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Manna is a type of Christ John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father v. 32 for God s chosen people to live by Christ v. 57 . Although we may readily acknowledge that manna is a type of Christ, we should not regard this in a natural way or superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we consider the account of the sending of manna in Exodus 16, it is important for us to see the relationship between our eating and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must eat in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is another basic principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me. Without eating, it is not possible for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must go on to see that the way we live depends on what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you eat a great deal of fish, you will be constituted of the element of fish, for you will absorb the life and nature of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly you will not be constituted of fish if your diet includes only chicken or beef, but no fish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kind of life we have depends on the kind of food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the picture in the book of Exodus, the children of Israel were destined to have a heavenly living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, when they came out of Egypt, they brought Egyptian food with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the first few weeks of their travels, they ate this Egyptian food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when the supply of Egyptian food was exhausted, the people were troubled and began to murmur and complain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the shortage of food was a problem to the people, it was a cause of joy to God, for it gave Him an excellent opportunity to change the living of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s intention was to change their living from an Egyptian living to a heavenly living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not want merely to adjust, change, or regulate the people outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wanted to change them organically by changing their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they had many different things to eat, all elements of the Egyptian diet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God wanted to change their diet from many items to just one item, and that item was the manna which came from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 2 God s intention was that the tree of life become man s unique diet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 22 indicates that the tree of life will be our unique diet in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although this tree will bring forth twelve kinds of fruit, there will nonetheless be just one tree in the New Jerusalem, not many trees.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In today s Christianity, on the contrary, there are thousands of trees; that is, there are thousands of sources of food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in God s economy there is one tree the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This tree was in the garden, and it will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Exodus 16 and John 6 the tree of life appears by the name of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you read the Bible carefully and with understanding, you will see that manna and the tree of life are interchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The manna is the tree of life, and the tree of life is the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that the manna in Exodus 16 was the tree of life in Genesis 2, and that the manna in John 6 will be the tree of life in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Manna and the tree of life are different terms to describe one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God does not have two kinds of food for His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because there is one God, there is also just one kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is both our manna and our tree of life for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have one God, one Christ, and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also have one food, one diet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The people in the world, however, live by many different kinds of foods.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the previous message we pointed out that worldly people may live on such things as education, sports, and amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as there are supermarkets for physical groceries, there are also psychological and religious supermarkets for psychological and religious groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the people in the world feed on so many things other than Christ, we may rightly regard them as today s Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we were saved, we were in Egypt enjoying the Egyptian diet with all the other unsaved people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we have been saved and have made our exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now God intends to change our diet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we may still desire to sit by the fleshpots in Egypt, to feed on cucumbers, melons, onions, leeks, and garlic, or to enjoy fish from the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we face the problem of having more than one element in our diet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also have the problem of living on many things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, although I encourage the young people to get a good education, I must remind them not to live on education.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Education should not become our diet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to God s economy, we should live on Christ and on Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ should be our unique diet, and we should live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not seek to live on any other food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever satisfies, strengthens, and sustains us is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The unique food we take for our sustenance, strength, and satisfaction must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, many believers do not take Christ as their unique source of satisfaction, strength, and sustenance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, they are trying to be satisfied, sustained, and strengthened by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because God wants us to live on Christ, we should be sustained, strengthened, and satisfied by Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have strongly emphasized the fact that God wants to change our diet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His intention is to cut off the worldly diet and to limit us to a diet of heavenly food, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because terms such as temptation and loving the world have been used in a light way in Christianity, I prefer not to use them in speaking of the divine revelation in Exodus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I wish to inquire concerning your diet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On what are you living day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What do you take in to satisfy, sustain, and strengthen you?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all must face these questions and answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all should be able to say, The Lord is the only One who satisfies me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apart from Him, I have no satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am daily strengthened and sustained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is the only food on which I rely.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I can testify that for more than fifty years I have not been satisfied, strengthened, or sustained by anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From the time I was saved at the age of nineteen, Christ has been my satisfying food.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have obtained certain good things, but none of these things has satisfied me even once.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ must be our food, satisfaction, strength, and sustenance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not mean, however, that we do not need certain things for our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need various good and useful things, including, for example, education.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we should not allow these things to become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may need them and we may have them, but we should not live on them or by them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our only food is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Christ who is our food is the Christ who has become subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is the processed God indwelling our spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the one hand, Christ is in heaven as the Lord of all; on the other hand, He is dwelling in our spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We look to the Lord in the heavens, and we fellowship with the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Praise the Lord that He is within us subjectively!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The main purpose for His being so subjective to us is that He may be our food, our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Anything which is to be our food and life supply must be something that can enter into us and then be assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It must be taken in and become part of the very tissue and fiber of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christ is subjective to us in precisely this way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul tells us, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whenever we eat a certain food, we join ourselves to that food.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For example, when I eat fish for dinner, I join myself to the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the same principle, when we eat Christ as our real food, we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, the Christ who is subjective to us, to whom we are joined and with whom we are one spirit, is our food, our heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is crucial for us to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In giving these messages on the book of Exodus, I am not content merely to carry on a Bible study or to pass on teachings to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>My desire is that we shall experience all these matters in a way that is actual and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Before giving this message, I prayed to the Lord again and again that we all may see our need to live on Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We don t need teachings, doctrines, and Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We need to take Him as our food and to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Feeding on Christ and living by Him should not be an occasional practice.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Rather, it should be the way we live twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>During the past months, most of the confession I have made to the Lord has been related to my shortcoming in the matter of living Him by being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Every day I have had much to confess to the Lord regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Early in the morning I pray, Lord, grant me today s portion of grace that I may live You and practice being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>For about an hour I may be successful in living in one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then I become conscious of the fact that I am no longer one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Thus, I need to confess, ask for the Lord s forgiveness, and come back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To be one spirit with the Lord is like breathing: it does not happen once for all, but takes place moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In my early days I found it difficult to overcome certain besetting sins.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Now, by the Lord s mercy and grace, I am no longer troubled by those sins.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>What I find difficult today is learning to be continually one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is a very hard lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If I myself do not practice being one spirit with the Lord, then my ministry concerning this matter has no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Living Christ and living by Christ should not be mere doctrine; it must be our practical daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I myself must learn to live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In my experience I have discovered that being one spirit with the Lord requires great sensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The besetting sins are coarse and crude, but living in one spirit with the Lord is very delicate and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When I was young, I wondered why the Lord charged us to watch and pray Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I wondered what need there was for me to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Now I am learning that we need to watch lest we inwardly lose contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We need to be watchful lest we turn off our spiritual switch and become separated from Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In order to be cut off from Christ, we need not do something coarse, such as lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We can be cut off from Him simply by looking at our husband or wife in a way that is unkind.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We need to turn to the Lord, confess, and receive His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We even need to ask Him to cleanse our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The reason we have an unkind expression on our face is that we are not at that instant one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Every morning we should ask the Lord to give us the grace to be one spirit with Him for that day.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Then we need to exercise to be one spirit with Him in a practical way throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If we try to practice this, we shall realize that time after time we are no longer one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Our experience may be somewhat like a lamp that, because of some electrical problem, switches off and on unpredictably.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I once had such a lamp in my study, and I found it very troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>One moment the light was on; the next moment it was off.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>It would switch off and on all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We are often this way in our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>All those who want to live Christ by being one spirit with Him will be troubled by such on-and-off experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>As you are getting ready for bed at night, ask the Lord to prepare you to practice being one spirit with Him the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If we endeavor to live in oneness with the Lord, we shall discover that taking Christ as our food has been for us largely a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It is not yet much of a reality in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Many Christians know that manna is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>But simply to know this as a doctrine does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>God s intention is for us to live on Christ all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>He does not want us to live on anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We need certain things for our living, but they should not become food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Christ is our unique diet, and we should live by Him and on Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>May our eyes be opened to see this crucial matter.</S>
