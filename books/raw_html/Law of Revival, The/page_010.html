        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h1>
<p>According to the divine revelation, revival is a law in the spiritual life of a Christian by which we can grow gradually in the Lord. Having this realization will help us to experience God as life. In this chapter we will consider how to apply the law of revival continually.</p>
<p>Although many saints attend the various meetings of the church, the saints are not living. They sit in the meetings with long faces and do not open their mouths to pray or to say Amen when others pray. Spiritually speaking, they look as if they have not had enough food, water, or sleep. If they are always down spiritually, this indicates that there is a problem.</p>
<p>The reason many saints go for a long time without eating, drinking, or sleeping spiritually is that they do not adequately know the law of revival. Hence, they do not apply this law continually. Our living is not disciplined, because we neither understand nor live according to this law. A person who is disciplined is healthy, because he has regular times for eating and sleeping. We need to maintain a disciplined living in our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE PHYSICAL LIFE</h2>
<p>Every human being knows that our physical life operates according to a law and that man must live according to this law. According to the law of our physical life, we must sleep eight hours, eat three times a day in the morning, afternoon, and evening, and drink an adequate amount of water. We may also need two or three snacks daily. These items are indispensable. When we live according to this law for a long period of time, these items are developed into our habit and become a discipline. For example, we sleep not only because we are worn out and cannot stay awake any longer. Most people must go to bed at a certain time, whether or not they are sleepy. This is a disciplined living. This discipline is established gradually according to the needs of our physical life.</p>
<p>Similarly, after we wake up in the morning, we must eat a meal whether or not we are hungry. Our eating a meal in the morning is not based on our feeling; it is according to discipline. Those who are disciplined not only eat at fixed times but also eat a fixed amount. They do not eat more when they feel like eating or eat less when they do not feel like it. Whether or not they feel like it, they eat the same amount of food. This is a disciplined living. In the afternoon they will eat another meal, and in the evening they will eat again. Then around ten o&rsquo;clock they will go to bed and sleep until the morning. In the morning they rise and eat another meal. We are not forced to do these activities, nor are these activities based on our feelings. These activities are based on a law. If we live a disciplined life according to this law, we will have normal growth and be strong.</p>
<p>The result of eating, drinking, and sleeping is a revival. Even if we are very tired at night, we will be restored and refreshed in the morning after we get up, wash, and eat breakfast. Being restored is a revival. Then after four hours of expending our energy, the revival ends, and we feel tired and fatigued by noon. Therefore, we eat lunch and take a nap in order to be restored again. This is another revival. We then go through another process, and the revival ends in the evening. Hence, we feel tired and need to eat another meal. After eating, we are restored and refreshed again, and we are full of energy when we go to the meeting. This is another revival. After a few hours of activity, we are tired; hence, we go to sleep at night. When we rise up in the morning, we have another revival.</p>
<p>According to the above example, adequate sleep, eating, and drinking issue in a revival. A revival involves a beginning, a course, and an ending. After the ending of a revival, we sleep, eat, and drink once more and are revived yet again. As this cycle continues, we are continually revived.</p>
<p>It is rather easy for us to experience a daily revival in the physical realm. Feeling tired is a sign that tells us we should sleep, feeling hungry is a sign that tells us we should eat, and feeling thirsty is a sign that tells us we should drink. When we have adequate sleep, food, and water, we experience a revival. After a while we will feel tired, hungry, and thirsty again, meaning that it is time for us to sleep, eat, and drink in order to begin another revival. The revivals in the physical realm are not once for all. They involve a beginning that is followed by a course and then an ending. After the ending we need another revival. The ability of our physical life to exist, grow, and become strong is dependent on the cycle of revivals. This is a law of the physical life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A DISCIPLINED SPIRITUAL LIVING</h2>
<p>The physical life is often a clear picture of our spiritual life. If we know the law of our physical life and are disciplined to live according to this law, we will be healthy. However, we must admit that we do not adequately understand the law of our spiritual life. For this reason, our spiritual life is not disciplined. Even though we may not strictly live a disciplined life physically, we still have energy in the morning, afternoon, and evening. In other words, we continue to have revivals throughout the day. With regard to our spiritual life, however, we often feel down when we meet and serve, because we do not adequately know the law of revival. This is a serious problem.</p>
<p>I once asked a brother concerning his spiritual condition. He replied, &ldquo;My condition is poor. For three weeks my spirit has not been able to rise up.&rdquo; His condition was the result of his wife being sick. I also asked a sister concerning her condition, and she replied, &ldquo;I do not know what to do. Every month our income cannot cover our expenses.&rdquo; Quite a few brothers and sisters are in the same situation. Figuratively speaking, I do not often see a saint who has had enough sleep, food, and water, that is, one who is invigorated and revived. Rather, the saints are often downcast, dry, stale, deadened, suffering, and pressed down. These conditions are the issue of not having adequate sleep, food, and water. Some saints have been in this condition for several years; they always feel pressed down and weak. Their conscience bothers them if they do not come to the meeting, but they cannot touch anything in the meeting. Their conscience bothers them if they do not serve, but they are overburdened. It is not reasonable for a Christian to be pressed down for years. This situation is not right, but many saints are in this situation because they do not know the law of revival and, hence, do not live a disciplined spiritual life.</p>
<p>If someone says that he is tired and does not have strength because he has not slept well for three years, we would be shocked and ask him why he has not slept well. Likewise, if a person cries because he is hungry and thirsty, we would ask him why he does not eat or drink. Hunger and thirst are signs, telling us to eat and drink. If we refuse to eat and drink, our tears are useless. Christ is dwelling in us, and He is our eternal food and the fountain of living water. We do not eat or drink Him, because we do not know the law of revival, and we do not live a disciplined life. We do not know that we should eat Him when we are hungry, drink Him when we are thirsty, and rest in Him when we are tired. We know the law of our physical life and live according to it; hence, we sleep when we are tired, eat when we are hungry, and drink when we are thirsty. However, we are weary, hungry, dry, low, old, dead, and miserable because we do not know the law of our spiritual life. It is unnecessary for us to be in this condition.</p>
<p>Most Christians have an improper understanding concerning the law of revival. They think that a person needs to be revived only after he has committed a sin or has backslidden. Our spiritual life grows through repeated revivals. Eating, drinking, and sleeping cause our physical life to grow. Similarly, our spiritual life grows by eating, drinking, and sleeping, that is, by our being revived. In the physical realm being thirsty is a sign for us to drink, being hungry is a sign for us to eat, and being tired is a sign for us to sleep. Because we understand the law of our physical life, we drink when we are thirsty, eat when we are hungry, and sleep when we are tired. As a result, we are revived. However, we do not understand the law of our spiritual life. Hence, we do not drink when we are thirsty, we do not eat when we are hungry, nor do we sleep when we are tired. Instead, we lament and sigh.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the saints never have adequate food, water, or sleep. Sometimes they get enough food, water, and sleep, but this is not a regular occurrence. For example, a brother who has been thirsty for several months will occasionally take a drink and be so happy that he will praise and testify in the meeting. However, we are not revived regularly, nor do we have the assurance of being revived, because we do not know the law of revival, and we do not live a disciplined life according to this law.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
