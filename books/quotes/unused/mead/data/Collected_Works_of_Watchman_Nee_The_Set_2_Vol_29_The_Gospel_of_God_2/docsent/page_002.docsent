   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>POSITIVE REASONS 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last few messages, we saw that there is a distinction between sin and sins in man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We saw how God loves us and gives His grace to us, how His grace is manifested in His righteousness, how the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work for us, and what His death and resurrection have done.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, we saw how man can receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man does not receive God's salvation through the law, good works, confession, prayer, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the last message, we saw how to believe and what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message, we will continue with our study.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows us that the duration of God's salvation is eternal; it is not temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, God's salvation is given to man eternally, rather than temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once a Christian is saved, there is no possibility for him to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not saying that there is no chastisement for a Christian once he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither am I saying that there will not be judgment and loss of reward if a Christian is not faithful in the Lord's work after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Christian can be disciplined in this age, and also be punished in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am not saying that a sinner will be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am saying that a believer whose work is not approved by the Lord will lose his reward at the time of the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a believer has sins that have not been repented of in this age, he will receive definite punishment in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of these are truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible also shows us that there is no possibility of a Christian being lost again, once he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, once we have been saved before God, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man always has the thought that even though he is saved, he does not know whether he will become unsaved after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God says that we have passed out of death into life John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we wonder whether or not we can pass out of life into death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God says that we will not perish but will have eternal life 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we wonder if we will not have eternal life but will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not know if our salvation before God can be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, after we read the Word of God carefully, we find that once a person is saved, he is eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We want to consider this question from two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, we want to consider it from the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, we will consider it from the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this message, we want to see from the Bible how God's salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God's salvation could be lost, what would happen to man?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, we will consider this matter from the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will consider verse by verse all the Scripture that seemingly speaks of salvation not being eternal and being able to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will see whether or not the salvation granted to us by God can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this message we will consider what is mentioned on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must see clearly whether or not the Bible says that we can lose the salvation that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD'S GRACE AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have previously mentioned what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of the readers of the New Testament know that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one would be so incorrect as to say that salvation is by the law and not by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man says that a person is saved by the law and not by grace, he has never read the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This light is too great in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some things we can let go of easily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we cannot let this matter go by in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If salvation is by grace, then we can never be a debtor before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I show grace to others, I cannot expect any repayment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I had any thought of repayment, and if I had any hope of being repaid, this would be a loan and not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I give something to you with the hope that one day you will return it, this is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God gives us grace today with the hope that we will render good works to Him later, it is not grace either.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is absolutely no return regarding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What does the Bible say about the way to receive eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Rom 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the eternal life that we have received cannot be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A gift is a present from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is something that God gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If others give something to us, can they ask for it back?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not kindergarten children, giving others some candy one day and asking for it in return the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A gift is something given freely.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If our salvation could be lost, Romans 6:23 would have to say, "The loan of God is eternal life in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A loan can be reclaimed, but something that is given cannot be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once it is given, it is given forever.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If eternal life is given to us in Christ, then it can never be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word gift in the original language clearly indicates that it is something given freely; it cannot be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If it cannot be reclaimed, then there is no possibility of us losing the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible shows us clearly that God's gift is without repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eternal life is an important item of God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Salvation is also an important item of God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There are many other items besides these.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's gift is given without repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If there is no repentance, how can God reclaim it?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to reclaim it, there must first be regret.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without any regret, there can never be any reclaiming.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At the same time, if there is any reclaiming, it is no longer a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>With giving, there is no such thing as reclaiming.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Can I say that I am giving something and then claim it back again tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If it is given, it cannot be reclaimed.</S>
