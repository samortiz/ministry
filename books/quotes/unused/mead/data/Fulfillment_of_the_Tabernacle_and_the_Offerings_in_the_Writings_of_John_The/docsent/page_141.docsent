   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 4 Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 18-20, 28a; 16:5-7, 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the second sign found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Son's going and coming.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This sign involves the process of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why do we consider the Son's going and coming to be a sign?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We regard this as a sign because when the disciples heard about the Lord's going and His coming, they understood it in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They thought that the Lord's going meant that He would leave them and stay away from them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord's going signifies something mysterious and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Notice that I use the word "signifies"; I do not use the word "means."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not speaking about what the Lord's going means, but about what it signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's going was not merely a going away, a leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, His going was a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The disciples, however, did not understand the significance of the Lord's going.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they heard the word "go" come out of the Lord's mouth, they understood it in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not realize at the time that the Lord's going signified something deep, mysterious, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we need to see that the Lord's going is a wonderful sign.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle, the Lord's coming spoken of in John 14 is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most Christians think that the Lord's coming here refers to His second advent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But by the word "coming" the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, most Christians think that the Lord's coming mentioned here is future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, in their expositions they make this coming an event at least two thousand years after His going.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their exposition can be compared to Martha's expounding of the Lord's word in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Lazarus had died, the Lord told Martha that her brother would rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She responded by saying that she knew that he would rise up in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the Lord was trying to tell her that Lazarus would be raised up that very day because the Lord Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In her exposition of the Lord's word, Martha postponed the raising up of her brother until the distant future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Expositors make a similar mistake in expounding the meaning of "coming" in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord meant by the word "coming" a coming that was soon, a coming that would take place after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But a number of expositors understand the word "coming" to refer to the Lord's coming back at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This understanding has nothing practical for our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Lord repeatedly explained to the disciples the significance of His going and coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the disciples were preoccupied with their natural and traditional concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter how much the Lord explained to them concerning His going and coming, they could not understand what He was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The situation is similar among most of today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians today are occupied with traditional teaching and their natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of this preoccupation, they do not have the proper understanding of the Lord's going and coming in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, there is the need for us to see that both the Lord's going and His coming are signs indicating something deep, divine, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SON'S GOING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son's going is a sign of His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the Lord to go was for Him to go through an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To Solve the Problem of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through His all-inclusive death, the Lord solved the problem of sin Rom 8:3; John 1:29; Heb 9:26, 28; 1 Cor 15:3; 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lamb of God took away the sin of the world when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This aspect of His crucifixion is included in the sign of His going in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you ever realized that the Lord's going was His crucifixion?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have seen, this is related to Christ as the sin offering Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord was crucified, He was lifted up, as the brass serpent was lifted up by Moses.</S>
