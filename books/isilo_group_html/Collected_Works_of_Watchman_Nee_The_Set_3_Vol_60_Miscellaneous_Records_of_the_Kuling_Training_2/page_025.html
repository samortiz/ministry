His heart is hardened, wicked, satanic, fleshly, and worldly. It is impossible for such a heart to believe in the Lord. Before the Holy Spirit operates on our gospel friends, it is impossible for them to believe in the Lord. Therefore, we must trust in the Holy Spirit for our preaching. We have to use God's word to open the sinner's heart and to create something in it that was not there before. The goal of the gospel is to gain a beachhead in man's heart and to expand such a beachhead. This is the key to preaching. There is no desire for God within the heart of a fallen man. It is filled with evil. In order for a sinner to receive salvation, the first thing we have to do is to create a place for God within his heart with the words of the gospel. Only then will a person accept the gospel. When our words go out, they first lodge in the mind of the listener. Then the mind becomes the gateway for salvation. Next God gains the desire of the heart, and finally He gains the will of the man. Hence, it is not enough to merely gain the mind. When God's word enters a sinner, the first thing that happens to him is the forming of some new thoughts. These new thoughts create a new desire for salvation in him. Next he resolves within himself to be saved. Once he makes this resolution, the gospel breaks through in him.</p><p>Hence, the goal of the gospel is to create a desire in man. There are three objectives in the process of preaching: 1) The initial objective is to put certain ideas in man about salvation so that he begins to understand a little about God and salvation. 2) The chief objective of preaching is to make men seek after God, to create a desire for Him and an inclination for salvation. 3) The ultimate goal of preaching is to cause men to choose God. The gospel does not conquer man through his understanding but through his desire. Creating such a desire within man is the main goal of preaching. In preaching the gospel, the first thing we have to do is to undergird man's thoughts with God's word. The final step, however, is always to lead him to a decision. First, we have to lodge God's word, the sure word, into man's mind. Then we follow this first word with a second word to pry him open, to create in him a desire. Finally, we should lead him to a decision. The first word is a "straight hook," while the second word is a "curved hook." The first word provides a support in the thoughts. The second word is a tool to pry open the emotion. The result is a deliberate decision in the will to receive salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL FACTOR BEING DESIRE</h2><p>All good gospel preachers first deposit a few words in the sinners' mind and then pry open and stir up their desire with more words. Lastly, they invite and urge the sinners to believe. This is how they turn the sinners around. Matthew 13:15 contains three words: lest, understand, and turn. The word understand relates to the mind. The word lest implies a possibility of stirring up of one's desire. The word turn relates to one's decision. A man does not understand because he does not have the desire to understand, and he does not see light because his heart has no desire for such light. Most of the time the problem is not with man's mind or thoughts. The problem is with the motivation. In order for a man's mind to understand, we must make him willing to understand; he must want to understand. This is a matter of motive and motivation. If a man is not saved, it is because he has no motivation to be saved. If a man hears and understands the gospel but has no motivation to receive it, it will be useless even if he is forced to make a decision. The greatest problem facing a gospel preacher is the desire in man's heart. Once a man's heart is inclined toward the Lord, the major part of the job of preaching is done.</p><p>Proverbs 21:1 says, "The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of Jehovah;/He turns it wherever He wishes." The most important point in preaching the gospel is to gain man's heart. Once a gospel preacher gains a man's heart, the rest is easy. We have to spend time to study and learn. We must also look to the Holy Spirit to provide us with the suitable words, that is, words with "hooks" in them. Our words have to be like hooks that draw out man's desire and gain his heart. If we can do this, our gospel preaching will be a success.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
