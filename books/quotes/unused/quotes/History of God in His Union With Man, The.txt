Revelation 21 and 22 show us the marriage life in eternity between God embodied in Christ and His chosen, redeemed people
In this series of messages, we want to teach and interpret the Bible with the view of the history of God in His union with man
The Bible is written in a particular sequence from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to show us the biography of this wonderful living person
The first thing we have to let people know in a biography is the name of the person about whom the biography is written
If we need salvation, light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, or righteousness, Jesus Christ Himself is all these things to us
The words 'let Us' imply that God is triune and that the three of the Godhead had a conference among Themselves
Hebrews 7:3 reveals that Christ as the Son of God is without beginning and without ending self-existing and ever-existing
Elohim is plural, indicating that God is triune, three-one, as confirmed by the pronouns Us, Our, and He in Genesis 1:26-27; 3:22a; and 11:7
The three were there in the Old Testament, but they were never put together as one until the time of Matthew 28:19
Christ is in us, we are in Him, the Father is in Him, He is in the Father, and He with the Father and the Spirit is in us
In eternity past, in the present, and in eternity future, the three of the Godhead are co-existing and coinhering
The First is in the Second, and the Second is in the First, so when the second One speaks, the first One does the work
The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father
The Father is distinct from the Son, the Son is distinct from the Spirit, and the Spirit is distinct from the Son and the Father
The economy of the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages was to produce the church for the showing forth of God's multifarious wisdom
In the whole universe, two things are most crucial: 1) to produce the church for God's manifestation; and 2) to head up all things in Christ
The Second of the Divine Trinity was preparing to carry out His 'goings forth' from eternity into time to be born in Bethlehem as a man
In eternity past the Triune God was preparing to be incarnated, and that preparing was a part of His goings forth
Before God as the Second of the Divine Trinity came to be born in Bethlehem in time, He was preparing to come in eternity past
God blessed the believers in Christ with the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies before the foundation of the world
In eternity past God chose us to have His nature, indicating that He would be one with us, that is, that His nature would become our nature
In eternity past God predestinated us, marking us out, unto sonship, making us sons to Himself with His divine life
In eternity past, God made an economy to produce the church for His manifestation and to head up all things, including us, in Christ
He also held a council to determine that the Second of the Divine Trinity should come to die for us to carry out His economy
The Christian life began from God's choosing us and predestinating us in eternity past before the foundation of the world
Whatever He has done, whatever He is doing, and whatever He will do in His history are all for our Christian life
Moses was not very early; rather, he was at least four hundred years later than Abraham and at least twenty-five centuries later than Adam
Moses tells of man's fall through the serpent and even gives us the conversation between the serpent and Eve in much detail
It is sometimes like a snowball: As it goes through the generations, it becomes a big ball with little fact and the rest myth
If Genesis were just a book of history, the record concerning Joseph, for instance, would not need to be as long as it is
It is strange that only three pages of Genesis are about God's creation, while many pages are about this one man Joseph
Joseph occupies such a long portion of the record because God wants to show us how much He is there in Joseph's situation
In his youth this Jacob seemingly robbed everybody in his contact with them his father Isaac , his brother Esau , and his uncle Laban
In the Bible there is the principle that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed ; hence, Jacob was greater than Pharaoh
It is not a record of God in creation; rather, it is a history of God in His dealing with man, who is on His heart
By reading Genesis in this way, you can see this God manifested and shown to us through all the stories of Him with man
Some people say that the New Testament is more important than the Old, and some would even say that we do not need the Old Testament today
Without the story in Genesis 32 could you believe that God wrestled with the man Jacob and that He was not able to prevail against a man ?
In His wrestling He had no way to put Jacob down, but He exercised His almighty, divine, omnipotent strength and touched his thigh
Perhaps you think that this is just the story of God with Jacob and that today He would not wrestle with anyone
We have heard all the terms about God, that He is righteous, faithful, kind, loving, merciful, and so much more
Time began at the creation of the universe, as recorded in Genesis 1:1, and continues until the final judgment at the great white throne
We may not be as good as Esau; but even if we are as bad as Jacob, God can hate the good one and love the bad one
Let us now consider God's history in time as it relates to His creation of the universe and His judgment on Satan and the universe
The creation spoken of in Genesis 1:1 was the original creation, which preceded the restoration and further creation beginning with verse 2b
The foregoing matters are all related to God's initial creation of the universe, which occurred before Satan's rebellion
He is also called the son of the dawn, indicating that Satan was one of the earliest angels created by God at the 'morning' of the universe
Students of the Bible agree that according to the record of the Bible, in the age before Adam, there should have been some living creatures
Satan and his subordinate angels then became the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies, of which Satan is the ruler
God then judged Satan so that he will be cast from the heavens to the earth and into Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit
Although God has judged Satan, He will execute His judgment upon him step by step, until Satan is cast into the lake of fire
In Revelation 129 Satan is cast down from the heavens at another time and in Revelation 2023 he is bound and cast into the bottomless pit
Hebrews 214 tells us that Christ in His flesh on the cross destroyed Satan in his person and nature as the one who has the might of death
The more you read a book like Genesis the more you must admit that the Bible is really a record of Gods movements it is the history of God
We saw in message one that He firstly began to form an economy to make an arrangement according to His hearts desire for His good pleasure
In that move there was a council among the three of the Godhead among the Father the Son and the Spirit and a strong determination was made
He wanted to have mankind so that He could have an organism to express Him, represent Him, and even be one with Him
The Bible shows us that eventually after God moves so much throughout all the centuries, the New Jerusalem will come forth
Isaiah 45:18 says that God did not create the earth as a waste, but here in Genesis 1:2 we read that the earth became waste and void
The Hebrew word for moved means brooded or hovered, as when a mother bird broods over her eggs to bring forth life
You should not merely read the letters in black and white; rather, you must know the significance of what you read
These are all terrible things, yet these terrible things came under the brooding of the 'mother hen'; hence, they all became 'eggs'
There was the Spirit; then, after the Spirit there was light ; and after the light the firmament was made , which is the air
The first day light was a general kind of light; hence, the light bearers needed to be recovered on the fourth day
The general light of the first day was good for producing the lowest life, the plant life without consciousness
The fish, the birds, and the cattle all reproduce their young differently, and this indicates the levels of life
For all this life to grow on earth, there is the need of the air of the firmament and of the rain from the heavens to water the earth
With these the earth can produce all the things needed by man for his existence, and man was created fully for God
Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely the story of man's creation, but a full record of God's history in making Himself a duplication
God was not within the man He created, but something within man, that is, the spirit of man, is very close to God
The hand, like God's attributes, is the real thing; the glove, like the virtues, is the outward form, the covering of the hand
Outwardly we have God's form, and inwardly, in our spirit, we have God's image, yet in our created state we still do not have God
According to Genesis 2:9, all the trees in the garden were pleasant to the sight, but one among these trees was particular, the tree of life
God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he ate of it, he would die
We cannot fully understand the significance of these three precious materials until we read through the Bible and come to its end
Exodus reveals that gold was the base of the breastplate of the high priest, and this breastplate was full of precious stones
In his first Epistle, Peter said that the Lord is a living stone and that we are the living stones who are built up as a spiritual house
Eventually, at the end of the book of Revelation, the three materials gold, pearls, and precious stones are built up into a city
Merely to have a tree with a river flowing issuing in three kinds of materials to illustrate God's purpose in creating man is not adequate
At the end of the Bible, there is a built-up city with three precious materials gold, pearls, and precious stones
In this term we have begun to continue the study of the Christian life according to the Scripture from another angle
We have seen that the Holy Scripture is not only a record of stories of man but also a record of the history of God in His union with man
In this way he lured the woman into his snare, and through her he caused man to fall in man's transgression against God's clear word
By eating the evil fruit of the tree of knowledge Adam built a case of transgression of disobedience which caused him to be condemned by God
By this eating, Adam also accomplished a wrong action which poisoned him in his nature, causing him to be constituted a sinner
Through this one fall, Satan caused Adam to be condemned according to the commandment of God and constituted a sinner in the nature of man
Since Satan, who is the substantial element of sin, has entered into man, sin spontaneously entered into man with Satan
Today all of mankind, the whole world, has sin in their fallen nature to make them sinners in their constitution
Satan, sin, and death, three terrifying and damaging factors, entered into man, even mankind, through man's fall
Sin not only brought death to all mankind but also brought vanity and the slavery of corruption to all the creation
Due to the fall of man, man's soul was corrupted, man's body was changed in nature, and man's spirit was deadened
Fallen man is used to endeavoring to do something to cover his sinfulness and pretend to be something in falsehood
The last issue of man's fall was that God drove man out of the garden of Eden and closed to man the way to the tree of life
Only the wise and almighty God could afford a full and dynamic salvation to the man created by Him and spoiled by His adversary
What God created for His purpose according to His good pleasure was a wonderful, excellent, marvelous, and precious man
In God's condemnation of Satan, He gave Satan a limitation: he cannot move above the earth, and he cannot eat anything except dust
The death of this human seed on the one hand put Satan to death destroying him and on the other hand accomplished redemption for fallen man
Such a death makes Him the very righteousness that the fallen man can wear before God, not only to be redeemed but also to be justified
He became a human seed to die so that Satan could be destroyed and the redemption of man could be accomplished
Eventually, the result is that we fallen sinners who have been redeemed and justified can be in Him to be one with Him
Our gospel preaching, our gospel conversation with sinners, should be with this high gospel of the history of God
In this message we will see how God worked on His saints from Abel to Noah and judged the world from Cain to Babel
Abel lived on God in a spiritual sense, and he lived on what God did, on what God provided, in a physical sense
These particular descendants of Adam were separated people, sanctified unto God according to God's election, God's choosing
Do you believe that without God's moving on and with Abel, Abel could have been a person who was living God full time?
The beginning of the Bible shows us a person named Abel who can be considered as the first full-timer on this earth to live God
We have to realize that all real Christians, when they feel they are so weak and fragile, would spontaneously call, 'O Lord'
Whenever we got into trouble, whenever we felt so weak, fragile, and helpless, we spontaneously called, 'O Lord'
God prophesied concerning the deluge through Enoch naming his son Methuselah, which means 'when he is dead, it shall be sent'
The book of Jude tells us that Enoch as the seventh from Adam also prophesied concerning the Lord coming with myriads of His saints
Cush later begot Nimrod , who built up both Assyria with Nineveh as its capital and Babylon with Babel as its capital
The Europeans, especially in the last five centuries since the time of Columbus, have been enlarged, spreading throughout the whole world
God became his blessing, and this God is the rest to man, the peace to man, the enjoyment to man, and the salvation to man
If they are going to worship God they must believe in the God of the Jews receiving rest peace enjoyment and salvation in the Jewish tent
Eventually, the New Jerusalem bears the names of the twelve tribes and of the twelve apostles, all of whom were Jews
While God is working positively on His chosen ones, He is also working negatively on the rest of mankind who take Satan's way of death
His descendants then invented cattle-raising for making a living, music for amusement, and weapons for defense
God judged the corrupted world, composed of men who had become flesh, by the deluge to terminate the age of Cain
The first age of human culture was the age of Cain, and that age, that part of the world, was terminated by the flood
God judged at Babel the world, which had abandoned Him and had joined Satan as one, to terminate the race of Adam
God's judgment on the world is a strong evidence that the God-created yet rebelling world is still under God's sovereign ruling
Carpenters who make furniture spend much energy to make designs before they actually make a piece of furniture
On this earth there was a garden, and this garden was full of trees that were pleasant to the sight and good for food to nourish man
On the negative side, God judged those who forsook Him and took the way of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the way of death
If we take a picture of someone, and it is a photo of his feet, this means that we took the picture at the wrong angle
We need to view the Bible from the angle of the history of God to have a proper and complete view of the divine revelation
One was likened to the stars of heaven , and the other was likened first to the dust of the earth and second to the sand on the seashore
The servants of Lot had been fighting with the servants of Abraham, and this fighting was due to the shortage of land
God said, 'Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be'
It was as if God said, 'Abraham, I, the almighty God, Jehovah, am not only giving you descendants from the earth
Your enemies can deal with your descendants from the earth, but they cannot do anything with your heavenly descendants'
Throughout the centuries, the waves of Babylon, of Medo-Persia, of Greece, and of Rome came upon Israel again and again
On the one hand, Abraham received God's call, but on the other hand, he was not so willing to carry out God's call
Abraham came out of Chaldea, but instead of going into Canaan, he went with his father Terah and his nephew Lot and stopped at Haran
He called him out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house into the land that Jehovah would show him
God promised Abraham to make of him a great country, to make his name great, and to bless him and make him a blessing to others
Here Paul said that the promise God gave to Abraham, 'In you shall all the nations be blessed,' was the gospel
Eventually, Genesis 22:18 reveals that this blessing actually is not Abraham himself but his descendant, his seed
The priest of God, as God Most High, blessed Abraham, saying, 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth'
God also told Abraham in Genesis 15 that only the one who would come forth out of Abraham's own bowels would be his heir
God told Abraham that his heir must be one out of his own bowels and that his heirs would be as many as the stars in heaven
In other words, between you and God there is nothing contradicting and there is a harmonious situation and condition
He also changed his name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, of whom Abraham would have a son, Isaac
We can produce the real believers only by being circumcised, that is, by being crucified, regenerated, and renewed
Anyone who is taking the law as the source, according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, is a descendant rejected by God
These two sons with two mothers are an allegory of the grace of the New Testament and the law of the Old Testament
God spoke to Abraham the tenth time to prove him, to try him, by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering to Him
God spoke to him the eleventh time to stop him from offering his son Isaac and he replaced Isaac with a ram for a burnt offering
The positive side was Gods motivating stirring up and initiating the divine things in Abrahams life which is a sign of the Christian life
When God judged the evil world, God remembered His friend's talk with Him concerning Lot, even though they did not mention Lot
Her lingering look back at Sodom indicated that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was going to judge and utterly destroy
Eventually by the time of Genesis 18 and 19 Lot had entered into Sodom the center of sin which was condemned and judged by fire from heaven
Stephen told us that when Abraham was called by God in Ur of the Chaldees, God appeared to him in glory as the God of glory
After Columbus discovered the Western world and through the development of transportation, the Europeans have spread everywhere
God's second calling with His second speaking as the God of blessing attracted Abraham to go into the good land of the divine promise
The earthly governments may think that their respective territories belong to them, but actually the entire earth belongs to Jehovah God
The God of Abraham is seen as the God of secret care for His elect in saving Abraham from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife
Many of his descendants were killed by the four kinds of locusts in Joel 1:4, signifying the Gentile governments with their invading armies
The priest of God came to serve him with bread and wine as a kind of refreshment, and that refreshment resembled the Lord's table
God's justifying of Abraham meant that God became happy with Abraham and that Abraham was altogether in harmony with God
God became silent to Abraham for thirteen years, until he became ninety-nine years old, and God appeared to him again
When Abraham was ninety-nine years old, God came in to reconfirm His covenant, which became a covenant of circumcision
Circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh signifying that the flesh of our fallen man our natural man has to be cut off ended terminated
Christ's death on the cross, His crucifixion, is our real circumcision which cuts off our flesh with its passions and its lusts
The crucifixion is to cut off the old man the resurrection is to bring forth or to beget the new man and the new man is signified by Isaac
In Genesis 17 Christ's crucifixion is signified by circumcision, and Christ's resurrection is signified by Sarah begetting Isaac
Christ's death terminated our old man, and Christ's resurrection germinated our new man to make us the new creation
God with His human friendship came as a man, in the form of a man, to visit Abraham as His friend on the level of humanity
Genesis 22:11-14 reveals the Triune God of provision, in His providing a ram to replace Isaac for a burnt offering to God
The ram is the substitute for sinners, and the Angel of Jehovah is the One who serves Jehovah in taking care of God's friend
Paul said that Abraham is the father of all those who are justified by faith, so Abraham is the father of all the New Testament believers
In the relationship between God and us, the Bible puts us on the same standing not only as Abraham but also as Jesus Christ
Since we are the sons of Abraham in Christ , his God is our God, and since we are one with Christ , His God is also our God
Because the Bible considers Joseph as a part of Jacob, we want to see God's history in the life of Jacob with Joseph
God raised Isaac as the unique heir to Abraham to inherit God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham
Paul said that the unbelieving Gentiles were strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no participation in God's promise
The real covenant of God to His elect actually is only one, and that one covenant is altogether concerning Christ
Christ is the centrality and universality of God's covenant with His elect, and this covenant is the new covenant, the new testament
Isaac was a person who is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the one who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham
Christ was offered to God for God's satisfaction, obeyed His Father even unto death, and was resurrected from death
Isaac was put on the altar, and right at the time Abraham was about to kill him, God intervened, providing a ram as his substitute
God gained Rebekah to be Isaacs wife his counterpart through Abrahams old servant who typified the Holy Spirit as Gods servant sent by God
God raised Isaac as the unique heir of Abraham, God made him a type of Christ, and God also put him under His rich blessing
Isaac waxed great and grew more and more until he became very rich, having flocks, herds, and a great household
As a whole, God made Isaac an heir to inherit all that his father had and blessed him all the way in peace and prosperity
God raised Jacob as an heir to Abraham and to Isaac to inherit God's promise to them and God's covenant with them
He also struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother's device
He was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban
God promised Jacob that He, as the God of Abraham his father and the God of Isaac, would give to him and his seed the land whereon he lay
He also promised Jacob at Bethel that his seed would be multiplied as the dust of the earth, spreading to the west, east, north, and south
Jacob eventually arrived at his uncle Laban's home by suffering a long, lonely journey, indicated by his weeping to his cousin Rachel
Eventually, Jacob married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives
In the previous messages, we saw God's working on Abraham and Isaac, and we began to see His working on Jacob with Joseph
In order for us to understand the book of Genesis thoroughly, we have to know the life of Jacob even more than the life of Abraham
Isaac, in a sense, lived a peaceful life, but in another sense, he did not because his second son was forced to leave him
Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that in eternity past before the foundation of the world God chose us and predestinated us
Jacob did not need to struggle to get the birthright, to be the heir, because God had already destined him for this
God was doing everything to raise Jacob up so that he could inherit God's promise to Abraham and Isaac and His covenant with them
We need to see that if God had not destined Jacob to receive the birthright he could have never obtained it no matter how much he endeavored
Later, when he was about to confront the threatening situation with his brother Esau, he sent nine droves of cattle to him as a present
As he was approaching Esau, Jacob put the handmaids and their children foremost, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last
He struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother's device
He was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban
He arrived at his uncle Laban's home by suffering a long, lonely journey, indicated by his weeping to his cousin Rachel
Jacob stayed with Laban and worked for Laban for twenty years, and within this time Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times
The first fourteen years of his labor were his service to Laban so that he could gain Leah and Rachel as his wives
He came to Laban's house as a young bachelor, but he left Laban's house with four wives, eleven sons, and many herds of cattle
Though, Jacob faced the trouble from Laban while he was under the secret care of God as the Angel of God Christ
After Laban departed from Jacob, Genesis 32:1 and 2 say that 'Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him
After dealing with the trouble from his uncle, Jacob had to face the trouble of his brother Esau's dealing with him
After the trouble related to the situation with his daughter Dinah, the Lord charged Jacob to go back to Bethel
After Jacob and his family purified themselves from their foreign gods and ornaments, they returned to Bethel to serve God with an altar
Christ in His incarnation, on the one hand, was the Son of sorrows from His birth through His human life on the earth
from Benoni to Benjamin' is the story of Christ accomplishing His redemption from His incarnation through His ascension
Eventually, due to the severity of the famine, Jacob was forced to send his youngest son with his brothers to Egypt to buy grain
He blessed Pharaoh , he blessed Joseph with his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh , and he blessed all his twelve sons
God the Father was expressed in Abraham, God the Son was expressed in Isaac, and God the Spirit was expressed in Jacob
Genesis is a book on the creation of man to consummate with three persons Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob issuing in a people named Israel
Genesis 2:4-22 repeatedly mentions Jehovah Elohim, a divine title indicating God's relationship with His elect
Genesis does not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate persons but as one complete corporate person with three sections
Malachi 1:2 says that God loved Jacob, and Romans 9:10-13 says that God selected Jacob, choosing him even before he was born
In the section of Abraham we see God the Father who calls man justifies man and equips man to live by faith and live in fellowship with Him
In the section of the life of Jacob with Joseph, we see God the Spirit who works in all things for the good of His lovers
Romans 8:28 says that all things work together for our good, but we need to see that it is actually the Spirit who works in all things
It was in his old age that Jacob blessed all the people, and his old age was at the time when his son Joseph was ruling in power
The end of Jacob's life with Joseph shows us the maturity in the divine life through the working of God the Spirit
Christ is ministering all His riches to us, whereas the Spirit is always working in all things to discipline us
If we do not behave in the Spirit, the things we have can become instruments used by the Spirit to deal with us
If a brother has many suits and loves these suits more than he loves God, these suits can be used by the Spirit to trouble him
In a physical sense, it is more convenient for a brother to have a number of suits so that he can dress appropriately
If he does not behave in the Spirit, these suits can become more instruments used by the Spirit to deal with him
Today God uses all persons, things, and matters to trouble us so that we can become mature in the divine life to bless all the people
Jacob struggled with his brother to come out of the womb as the first, and he was holding his brother's heel at birth
Because of the threatening of Esau, he was forced to leave his father, his loving mother, his home, and his country
When he arrived at his uncle Laban's home, his cousin Rachel met him and he wept due to his long, lonely journey
When we read the strange occurrences in the life of Jacob, we may wonder why they are recorded in the holy Word
We need to realize that the life of Jacob was part of the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy
The Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God will consummate in the New Jerusalem
While Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were living in tents, they were eagerly waiting for the eternal tabernacle of God, the city of New Jerusalem
In the millennium Christ will be the reality of that feast as the full enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity
If we want to know the details of the genealogy of Christ, we have to read the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament
The issue of the history in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament was the bringing forth of Christ, the God-man
Christ being brought forth was for the producing of the Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God
The redeemed of God will be the tabernacle for the dwelling of God and the redeeming God will be the temple for the dwelling of the redeemed
Exodus shows us that God took a big step in His move by coming down to deliver Israel out of Egypt and bring them into the wilderness
Egypt typifies the world where people are occupied with making a living and where people can enjoy a life with pleasures
God came to comfort and encourage Abraham promising Abraham that He would give him a son and then He made a covenant to confirm this promise
In telling Abraham the future history of his descendants, God was confirming to him that he would surely have a son, an heir
Eventually, after Joseph died, the book of Exodus says that a new Pharaoh rose up in Egypt who did not know Joseph
At that time the children of Israel began to come under the persecution, tyranny, and slavery of the Egyptians
Because of the increasing multiplication of the Israelites, Pharaoh charged the people to kill all the newborn males among the Israelites
He lived in the palace of Pharaoh, was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in his words and works
God is the Deliverer who came down to deliver Israel out of the slavery and the tyranny of the Egyptians through Moses
They also had to eat unleavened bread, indicating that from that day they should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life
They also had to eat the lamb with bitter herbs, indicating that they should experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things
Where Christ is, there is the glory of God, and where the glory of God is, there is Christ as the Angel of Jehovah to serve God's people
We can see the manifestation of God's power in His working to deliver Israel out of Egypt and bring them into the wilderness
The flies and locusts were like the air force, the frogs were like the navy, and the lice from the dust were like the army
The 'I Am' who sent Moses to Pharaoh was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Every saved person must be saved to such an extent that he is fully transported out of the world and left with God alone
When they were in Egypt, they were prohibited from serving God and had to suffer the affliction of the Egyptian tyranny
The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness to serve God with sacrifices, typifying Christ as the offerings
Genesis shows us Gods history in His working through eight positive persons Adam Abel Enosh Enoch Noah Abraham Isaac and Jacob with Joseph
The history of the Triune God in Genesis was initiated in Adam and issued in three persons Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
From Exodus to Malachi is the history of God in one race, a particular race, a chosen race, the race of Israel
In the previous message, we saw how God came down to deliver Israel out of Egypt and bring them into the wilderness by four means
Redemption is a basic part of God's salvation, and the feast of Passover is a full type of the salvation of God
According to Exodus 12, the Israelites ate the meat of the lamb but they also ate the lamb with its head, legs, and inwards
To eat bitter herbs means that we need to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things
He sent the frogs as the submarines, the lice as an army, and the flies and the locusts as the planes to defeat Pharaoh and the Egyptians
It is very good to be saved by God out of the noisy world to a place where there is only the heavens and the earth and God, nothing else
God put all the children of Israel upon His wings and bore them through the wilderness to bring them to Himself at Mount Sinai
In God's history He also fed the children of Israel with manna , the heavenly food, typifying Christ as the bread from heaven
God quenched them with the living water , typifying the overflowing Spirit , out of the cleft rock , typifying the crucified Christ
At Mount Sinai, God made the children of Israel His own peculiar possession above all the peoples, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation
As God's peculiar possession, they were a beautiful people particularly belonging to God as God's heart's desire
They entered into the tabernacle as the dwelling of the Triune God on earth , typifying Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God among men
After entering into the tabernacle, they fed on the table of the bread of the Presence , typifying Christ as the believers' life supply
After eating the bread of the Presence, they were enlightened by the lampstand , typifying Christ as the light of life to the believers
The brass altar is in the outer court, outside the tabernacle, and the golden altar is inside the tabernacle, close to the Holy of Holies
As the resurrected and ascended One, He is the sweet and fragrant incense, in which God extends to us His well-pleasing acceptance
Finally, they were able to meet God through the propitiatory blood on the propitiation cover of the ark in the Holy of Holies
The blood shed outside the tabernacle at the brass altar was brought into the tabernacle and sprinkled on the cover of the ark
Through the laver and the brass altar in the outer court, they could enter into the very God embodied as the tabernacle
Once we were in Egypt, but we passed through the Red Sea and were borne through the wilderness to be brought to God
The entire book of Leviticus shows that God trained His elect to worship and partake of God and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life
The history of God as seen in the books of Genesis and Exodus consummated in the children of Israel as a nation
