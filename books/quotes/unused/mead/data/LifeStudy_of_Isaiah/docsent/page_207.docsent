   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A STONE AS A FOUNDATION, A TESTED STONE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND A PRECIOUS CORNERSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 28:16 says, "Therefore thus says / The Lord Jehovah: / Behold, I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, / A tested stone, / A precious cornerstone as a foundation firmly established; / He who believes will not hasten away."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ, who is our glory and our beauty, is also a stone in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a stone laid by God in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This stone is a foundation firmly established for God's building in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can enjoy Christ as such a firmly established foundation today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With the worldly people who do not believe in Christ, everything is fading.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because they do not have Christ as a stone, a foundation, on which to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As Christians, we have Christ as a crown upon our heads and as a rock under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This rock is firmly established for God's building among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is a tested stone which has been tried and which is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as a stone was tested during the thirty-three and a half years of His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the time that He became a man, He was tested every day of His earthly life, and He had no failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is perfect, complete, solid, and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is fully qualified to be our foundation because He has been tested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Isaiah 28:16, he who believes in this tried and trustworthy stone "will not hasten away."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The King James Version renders this portion as "shall not make haste."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Darby says in a note that this can be translated as "shall not hasten with fear."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This can also mean "will not hurry in panic."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is a trustworthy stone, and we believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever happens to us, we do not need to be in haste or in panic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The worldly people, even including Christians who do not trust the Lord so much, are always in haste, in panic, whenever something happens to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In their haste they do not know what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would like to share a little more about my experience of the Lord as the tested stone when the invading Japanese army arrested me about fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two men from the Japanese military police came to the meeting hall to see me early on Monday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I had been there only a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They came to know that I always went to the hall to do my work from eight to noon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I welcomed them to my study room, which was upstairs in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was not hastening away in panic, in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, I was steady.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They told me that they wanted me to come to their headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I agreed to go with them and presented them a small pocket version of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That Bible became a help to me when they interrogated me later.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I went with them, I asked a brother in the hall to please tell my wife that I was going to the military police headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was imprisoned by them for thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They examined me twice a day, and each session lasted about three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was always under their threatening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day one of them asked me why we called our conferences "revival conferences."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I replied that we did this because our church does everything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He asked me this because they suspected that I was doing a work for the Nationalist government to revive the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In China at that time, those in Christianity used a word meaning endeavoring; only we used the word revival.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After I told him that we do everything according to the Bible, he asked me if the matter of revival was in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I said "yes," he took the small Bible I had given them as a gift, threw it to me, and said, "Show me where it is."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under the Lord's sovereignty, I opened the Bible to the very page of Habakkuk 3:2, where Habakkuk prays, "O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years."</S>
