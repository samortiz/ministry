   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRUTH CONCERNING BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was recently alleged by a speaker at Melodyland that the local churches have called Melodyland, "Babylon."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know where this can be found in print or when it was ever said.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may be that some irresponsible person said it, just as irresponsible people from Melodyland have called us a cult.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wherever the elements of Babylon are present, there is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the elements of Babylon are present in Melodyland, Babylon is there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the elements of Babylon are present in the local churches, Babylon is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible, the word Babylon is equal to the word Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Babel is first mentioned in Genesis 11 where the tower of Babel issued in division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians today are in division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is, they are in Babylon and do not even realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are in the division and confusion of today s present situation, you are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Speaking of Babylon, Revelation 18:4 says, "Come out of her, My people."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are those who wonder why the local churches call the present Christian situation, Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is because the present Christian situation is filled with division issuing in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the church was one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, however, the church has been divided into many different segments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These divisions have caused confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether they realize it or not, those who are in the divided situation are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE TRUTH CONCERNING DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we must ask, "What is a denomination?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A denomination begins as a division brought about by Christians exercising personal preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The preferences include certain leaders, doctrines, practices, association with a certain race, etc. Eventually those with like preference form a group and denominate themselves by taking a name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, you have the Lutheran Church, the Baptist Church, the African Methodist Church, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, ad infinitum.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All such denominations are unscriptural divisions of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will now prove this from the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the book of Acts through Revelation, it is a simple, obvious truth of biblical history that all the Christians in one city formed only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Ephesus, in A.D. 60, it was absolutely unnecessary to consider which kind of church to join.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the saints there were one as the church in Ephesus Eph 1:1; Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A first-century Christian, visiting the churches, would have encountered no division among Christians in a city until he came to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Twenty years ago as a Baptist pastor, I questioned within myself, "Specifically what body' is it that Paul said should not be divided in 1 Corinthians 12:25?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The context of the chapter and the whole book makes it clear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was the body of all the Christians in Corinth who daily functioned together as the one church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Several facts prove this point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 The book was written to "the church of God which is at Corinth" 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This clearly includes all the believers in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 Paul had received a report of quarrels and divisions resulting from the saints' preferences for various leaders 1 Cor 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3 Paul rebuked the divisive ones on at least three major points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, to divide the Body is to divide Christ 1 Cor 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, to be divisive is fleshly 1 Cor 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third, by not discerning that the Body is one, they were suffering great loss at the Lord's table 1 Cor 11:18, 29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Galatians 5:19-21, Paul also condemns division as a work of the flesh, categorizing it with immorality and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last two words of verse 20 should be translated "divisions, sects."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since denominations, groups, centers, etc., divide the Body of Christ, they are works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the inevitable conclusion from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Deep within him, every denominational Christian's conscience testifies that he is, in fact, divided from other Christians by the organization to which he belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All agree there will be no denominations in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the unsaved recognize that the denominations are divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have often been challenged by the statement, "If you are all Christians, why are there so many different churches' with some opposing each other?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In John 17:21, Jesus prayed, "That they all may be one that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This demands a visible unity of all Christians in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, the world sees not oneness, but division.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We in the local churches repudiate all division.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After fourteen years' experience in the local churches, I can testify strongly that we are not a division and we have no division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither are we dividing the Body of Christ as our opposers falsely accuse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we are open to all born-again believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We call upon all Christians to drop their sectarian preferences which bring about the formation of denominated groups and divide the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Drop your preference of denominational names, certain leaders, doctrines, practices, etc. All the saints in one city would then be one church without any element of division.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One group of saints with the one Christ would form one unique church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Psa 133:1</S>
