   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that in the long run the Lord will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not only a matter of us gaining something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It must be that the Lord will gain what He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He needs a church that matches His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said that He would build His church on this rock Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee pointed out that this rock does not only mean Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This rock is the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter saw that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church will be built upon such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To say that Christ is the rock is easy, but to say that the revelation of Christ is the rock requires much study of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every denomination claims that their foundation is Christ, that Christ is the rock upon which they build their denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Catholic church claims the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But do they know anything about the revelation of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The revelation of Christ is altogether developed, explained, and presented from Matthew to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entire New Testament is the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For Christ to build up His church we need to know the entire New Testament as the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today there is a shallow gospel with a shallow revelation of Christ telling a person that he is a sinner, that God loves him, and that God gave His Son for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s Son came to be the Savior who died on the cross, resurrected, and is now in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He loves all men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person believes in Him, he will be saved and when he dies he will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since he has been saved, he has to be good, improve his character, and glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ cannot build the church upon such a shallow revelation of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been laboring in the United States for twenty-three years, trying the best to uplift the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I really suffer in my spirit to see the saints brought down to something shallow and elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord has released so many truths among us which are mostly in print.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that with us in the Lord s recovery something has really been sown into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have the full assurance that some day what the Lord has been sowing in these twenty-three years in the United States will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If not in this century, then in the next century it will surely come out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What Paul did in his day did not come out at his own time, but eventually we are here enjoying the issue of his labor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without Paul s labor, what could we say and what could we see?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What Paul saw is here not only in the Spirit but also in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without His fourteen Epistles, what could we know?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without his fourteen Epistles, how could we have the completion of God s divine revelation Col 1:25 ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that what the Lord has been doing in these past twenty-three years could never be in vain, but I am still human, hoping to see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes when I see something otherwise, my heart and my spirit surely suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If what we have done is something on the sinking sand, it will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what we have built on the revelation of Christ is on the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rock in Matthew 7 is the same as the rock in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the end of Matthew 7 the Lord says that whatever is done according to His word is built on a rock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That rock is the revelation because that rock is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The rock is not just the Person of Christ directly, but the revelation of this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why the churches are also built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, that is, upon their teaching Eph 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their teaching is the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PUBLISH OR PERISH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be a professor in a top university you must publish something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the top educational circles there is a slogan among the professors either publish or perish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be a professor at a top university requires a great amount of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These words apply to the elders publish or perish.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First you must learn something and then you can publish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before all the saints can be helped to speak, you have to be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do not take the initiative, who can start something?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our way is not the easy way, or the short-cut way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The God-ordained way is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot expect a baby born yesterday to be a good speaker after a week.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to raise him up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This takes at least eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the physical life takes time for growth and development, how could we expect the spiritual life to be fully grown overnight?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How many among us in the Lord s recovery have had a spiritual graduation?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must change our way at a cost, but to do so the elders must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not labor to publish, you will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have seen that the Christian way of meeting is talked about in Acts and 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Acts are the small home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In 1 Corinthians is the meeting of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In both kinds of meetings, mutuality and speaking must be there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For mutuality and speaking to be the reality in the local churches, there is the need of a great amount of labor on the part of all the leading ones.</S>
