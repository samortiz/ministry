   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Submit to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we have to learn to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everywhere we see man's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In any kind of human institution, we see rebellion and insubordination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man wants to be free and to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has his own proposals, views, and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there are no such things in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God's kingdom there is only order and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is nothing better in the whole world than submission, and there is nothing more beautiful in the whole world than order.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we have submission, and we submit one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we have no arguments, and no one strives to be the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is only divine order.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a beautiful thing it is when everyone is pursuing after submission!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Allow me to give a little testimony of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to learn this lesson in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, I was learning it in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the person to whom I had to submit might not necessarily be right, and although I might be right instead, if I refused to submit, I would not receive the discipline of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps at that time, there was not the discipline of the Body yet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at least, there was the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I first began to work for the Lord, I was quite young.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another co-worker was five years older than I was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning he was quite zealous, but he did not have much light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, God gave me quite a lot of light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time, many people exhorted men to believe in Jesus without being able to explain what they said.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I saw more light than others did with regard to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At one point, over sixty people wanted to be baptized, of whom ninety percent were saved through me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since I had brought them to salvation, naturally I should have been the one to baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But that other brother insisted that he would baptize them, for the reason that he was the older of us two.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible clearly indicates that whoever preaches the gospel also baptizes the ones he preaches to Acts 8:35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I thought it was quite reasonable that I should baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later I went to Miss Barber, and she said that I should let the other brother baptize these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I asked her why, and she told me that the other brother was older than I was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later I found another brother who was older than this one, and suggested that this second brother should carry out the baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Miss Barber insisted that the first one should carry out the baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was quite bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She told me that I should not reason, and she said, "Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From today on, you have to learn to listen to your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I thought that this brother was not clear about the truth or the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why then should I listen to him?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This went on for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every Sunday I fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God was teaching me the lesson of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today I can work together with others because I have learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible mentioned the centurion's word, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" Matt 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Witness Lee once said to me, "You are very severe when you speak on the platform, but you are not so severe when you step off the platform."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether I am severe or not, I do feel that a person who will not submit to authority is a wild and disorderly person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who live in the church should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person who does not submit to authority may be saved, but he does not act like a regenerated person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any time a person is free from any authority, he has no way to go on, and he does not have the reality of the church with him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With God there is the anointing, and this anointing is poured upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, we have to submit to the anointing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, we have to submit to the anointing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Protection and Blessings in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A Christian is most safe today, because for him, there is the protection of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A man can be miles off the target if a boundary is not defined for him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today, many truths have been established already, and there is no reason for us to stray off any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as we remain in the Body, the blessings and the anointing are here.</S>
