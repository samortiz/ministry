   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRADITIONAL MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>KILLING EVERYONE S FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are still brothers and sisters who are not willing to meet in the homes, because they feel that the home meetings lack flavor and are small and troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many saints still prefer the methods and traditions of Christianity; these saints are holding on to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every Sunday Christians go to a building, whether it is called a chapel or a meeting hall, to sit and listen to others sing hymns, read the Bible, and speak the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This practice binds the believers because they do not need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, after a period of time the believers lose their function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was also our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently, the new believers we gained knew only how to meet in the meeting halls after they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not have the concept of functioning in the meetings, because they felt that they did not know the Bible and that they lacked spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they could only sit and listen, not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also have saints who feel that after working six days a week, they should come to the Lord s Day meeting to listen to a message and relax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we require these saints to function, they may feel that they are being pressured by the church and may no longer want to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since we changed the system, we have fellowshipped this burden many times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also arranged for all the brothers and sisters to be in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, some of the home meetings have lost their momentum because the saints who usually speak in these meetings are knocking on doors to preach the gospel, and the remaining saints in the home meetings do not usually speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was the church s arrangement in order for one-fourth of the saints to go out door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, the home meetings and the small groups lost the people who usually speak, and they lost their momentum.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our current situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HOME MEETINGS BEING OUR PRESENT NEED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This situation shows that a desire to strengthen the big meetings only is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to see that the Christian life begins from the home and that every brother and sister must have a home meeting to be a strong Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past we focused on big meetings, and we did not care for the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, our new ones did not receive sufficient care.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need normal home meetings even if we meet only once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An entire family should gather together for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a formal worship service in the home; rather, it is to make our families living and full of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The husband may say Hallelujah, the wife, Amen, and the children, praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They do not need to speak a special word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They need only to exercise their spirit for half an hour, and the entire family will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some sisters genuinely love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the more these sisters love the Lord, the more difficult it is for their children to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because these sisters care only for the Lord; they do not care for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want our children to be well behaved and receive good grades in school, we must spend time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, we may not be able to say much concerning the economy of God, but we will gradually learn to say something by attending the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a home meeting someone may ask, What verse in the Bible speaks of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another person may answer, Ephesians 3 speaks of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then a young brother can open the New Testament and read Ephesians 3:9-10 to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the end of the meeting someone else may suggest that everyone sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of the brothers and sisters do not speak and others do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the situation in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A brother who works in a hospital testified recently that one hundred fifty saints work as doctors, nurses, and staff in the same hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before we started the home meetings, these one hundred fifty saints did not function, but since the home meetings began, these saints have been functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They started meeting in different homes, and presently three to five households gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not need to determine beforehand what they will speak about, nor do they appoint a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They simply come together to exercise their spirit and overthrow the system of everyone listening to one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By meeting in this way, they are enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When everyone is together, they exercise their spirit and say Hallelujah, Amen, praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, everyone also says something briefly concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a meeting is sweet and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past we had traditional meetings in which everyone was silent and buried their function.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whoever went to the meeting buried his function.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, we did not want the new ones to go to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were concerned that in the big meetings the new ones would be infected with germs and die.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The people in the communities whom we brought to salvation through door-knocking do not know the practices of traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After they were saved, they immediately began to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their children and wives testify and pray, and they even lead the hymn singing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the home meetings the new ones can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way the new ones are led to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we bring them to the meetings in the meeting hall, they will see that only one person speaks, and everyone else listens and nods their head.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This will trouble the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason, we did not encourage the saints to bring the new ones to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our former way of meeting became an old habit, but now the Lord is leading us forward.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have seen new light and a new practice; hence, we should adjust our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot continue with the big meetings of the past, in which everyone comes together on the Lord s Day to listen to one brother give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must all have home meetings, small group meetings, district meetings, and even big meetings, and we must all exercise to speak in these meetings.</S>
