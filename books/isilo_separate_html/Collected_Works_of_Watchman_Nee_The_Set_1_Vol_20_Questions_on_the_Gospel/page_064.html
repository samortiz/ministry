The Forgiveness through God's People</H2><P>John 20:23 says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." Is not the mention of forgiveness in this verse strange? Does this mean that the apostles have the authority to forgive sins on earth? If we do not understand the meaning of this verse, we will not be able to refute the pope's authority. The authority of our forgiveness as related to salvation is in God's hand. If you go to Peter and he does not forgive you, does this mean that you are not saved? No, salvation and the forgiveness of sins depend absolutely on receiving the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Then what does forgiveness in this verse mean? It refers to a declaration which the church makes under the direction of the Holy Spirit and is based on the church's understanding of a person's forgiveness before God. We must notice that it says, "Whosever sins you forgive," not "Whom you forgive." "Whosever" is plural not singular; it is corporate not private; it is not by an individual but by the church. "Whosever sins you forgive" means that the church declares that the sins of a certain man have been forgiven and he is saved. Someone may come to the church declaring, "I have heard the gospel and believed. Please receive me that I may be baptized and break bread the same way as the other disciples." In order to receive him, the brothers have to know whether his sins have been forgiven. If the brothers know that his sins have been forgiven before God and that he is a child of God, they can declare that he has been forgiven and saved, and receive him. If the brothers are not clear from within, they cannot make such a testimony for such a one; therefore, they cannot receive him. The forgiveness of the church is based on the forgiveness of God. The church merely declares what God has already done. Through the church, God announces the condition of a man before Him.</P><P>We must pay attention to verse 22 since verse 23 follows it. Only after verse 22 can we have verse 23. Verse 22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit." Based upon the power and instruction of the Holy Spirit, the church determines whether one's sins have been forgiven. It is not based on individual feeling. If a person is saved, and the church is not sure and asks him to wait for a little, this will not affect his forgiveness before God. For example, after Paul was saved and came to Jerusalem, he desired to join himself to the disciples. But they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he had believed in the Lord and become a disciple. Only after Barnabas testified for him was Paul able to be with the disciples coming in and going out in Jerusalem (Acts 9:26-28). Therefore, the church cannot forgive or retain one's sins directly; it only declares that one's sins are forgiven or not forgiven before God, deciding if he may have fellowship and communion among the disciples.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Forgiveness to Restore Fellowship</H2><P>First John 2:1 and 2 say, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world." First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." We must be clear about the special emphasis of the Gospel of John and 1 John. The Gospel of John shows the gospel among men; whereas 1 John shows the gospel in the heart of God. The Gospel of John has two lines: grace and truth. When grace is mentioned, truth is also mentioned. First John also has two lines: God is love, and God is light. On the one hand, it speaks of love, and on the other hand, it speaks of light. What is the relationship between grace and truth, and love and light? Love is in God's heart. When it is expressed among men, it is grace. Light is in God's heart. When it is expressed among men, it is truth. The Gospel of John brings God to man, while 1 John brings man to God. The Gospel of John speaks of the matters of life, salvation, eternal life, and so forth; whereas 1 John speaks of fellowship, drawing near to God, and going to Him. The Gospel of John deals with the matter of salvation; whereas 1 John deals with the matter of fellowship with God. The beginning of 1 John speaks of the matter of fellowship, and chapters one and two speak on the forgiveness in this fellowship.</P><P>There are two kinds of relationships between God and us. One is a kindred relationship in that we are saved and are children of God. This relationship can never be broken. Let me ask: is a son no longer a son of his father because of his misbehavior? No. If a son does not want to be his father's son, can he stop being his father's son? No. If a father denies his son, is the son no longer a child of his? No. If you are a certain man's son, can someone else or even Satan annul this fact? No. We can respectfully say that even God cannot deny this fact. Therefore, after a person is regenerated and becomes a child of God, no one is able to overthrow this relationship. This relationship can never be severed. Nevertheless, there is another type of relationship which is subject to interruption. This is the relationship of fellowship. For example, although you are your father's son, if you do something wrong one day, you will be afraid to see your father for fear of his rebuke. The more serious the mistake, the more you will be afraid to see him. Though your family relationship can never be cut off, your communication with your father may be broken. Our relationship with God is the same. After we are saved, there is still the possibility that we will commit sins. Whenever we sin, our fellowship with God is immediately cut off. In order for the fellowship with God to be restored, our sins must be forgiven. If we commit sins we must, according to 1 John 1:9, "confess our sins." We must say, "O God, I was wrong in this matter; please forgive me." After confessing this way, our fellowship with God can be restored.</P><P>By what means are we cleansed from our sins? We are cleansed by the blood. Many Christians try to use time to wash their sins away, instead of applying the blood. How do they do this? Some may commit a sin and stay in their bad feelings for several days, thinking that God could not forgive them so quickly. After five or ten days, when their heart is at peace, they think that the sin is no more. They try to wash their sins away by using five or ten days instead of applying the blood. We must remember that forgiveness of sins comes by the blood, not by forgetting. We are not forgiven because we have forgotten our sins. Rather, the blood of His Son Jesus washes away all our sins. God can only forgive our sins under the blood.</P><P>Someone once asked a child what a person should do if he has sinned. The child answered, "He should do two things. First, he should feel sorrowful for several days, and second, he should be forgiven." The theology of this child is the theology of many people. It is also the thought of many older people. It seems that only if we suffer enough will we be forgiven; otherwise, we cannot be forgiven. Brothers and sisters, even if one suffers many days, he still cannot earn one percent of forgiveness. While we should have a sorrowful and penitent heart for our sins, our forgiveness does not depend upon our sorrow. Rather, it depends upon the blood of Jesus who saved us. If we confess our sins, God will forgive us through the blood of the Lord, and the fellowship between God and us will be restored.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
