[1]  Christ in God's Economy Versus the Law in Man's Appreciation 1
[2]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Psa 1:2, 6; 2:6-7, 12; Luke 24:44
[3]  In a recent conference, there were four main points which I would like us to take note of in this introductory word to the Psalms:
[4]  1 The economy of God is to bring forth an organism for His Divine Trinity.
[5]  4 The issue of the experience of grace in the economy of God is the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem.
[6]  I. THE PSALMS BEING: A. Not a Book of Doctrines
[7]  The divine concept in the Psalms is also concerning God's heart's desire, His good pleasure in Christ as His centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression, in the kingdom for His eternal administration, and in the recovery of the earth for His eternal kingdom in eternity.
[8]  On the other hand, he saw all the evil ones prospering v. 3 . He was bothered until he went into the sanctuary of God, the temple of God v. 17 . Then he received the revelation, and he was led to have nothing in the heavens nor anything on the earth but God v. 25 . So, he declared that God was his living portion v. 26 ; not the law, but the very God Himself was his portion.
[9]  Jehovah's Anointed in verse 2 and the King in verse 6 are Christ.
[10]  The Son in verse 7 is also Christ as the resurrected One.
[11]  He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity John 1:18; 3:16 , but He needed to be begotten again in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .
[12]  THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK A. The Book of Psalms,
[13]  Actually, according to the divine concept, the central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ, as revealed in plain words Luke 24:44 , and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom, as typified by the temple and the city of Jerusalem.
[14]  Book 1 indicates that God's intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God the church.
[15]  VERSUS THE LAW IN MAN'S APPRECIATION 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 1:1-6; Rom 5:20; Gal 4:24-25; Rom 7:12, 14a; Psa 119:103, 105, 130; 2 Tim 3:16a; Exo 20:3-17; Psa 78:5; 119:88b; Rom 3:20b; 4:15b; 5:20b; 7:7b; Gal 3:23-24; Rom 3:19; Gal 3:21b; Rom 8:3a; 3:20a; Gal 3:11a, 12b; Psa 36:8; 1 Cor 3:6; John 4:10, 14; Rev 21:6; 22:1, 17b; John 7:38-39; Psa 73:1-7, 13-17, 23-26; Matt 5:10; Psa 1:5-6; Rom 2:12; Rom 10:4a; 6:14b
[16]  In this message we want to see the truth concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation.
[17]  We need to consider what the position of the law is.
[18]  God in His economy planned to create and to have a man in His image and after His likeness that man one day could receive Him as life to live Him and to manifest Him so that He might have an organism to express His Divine Trinity.
[19]  Being That the Man Who Delights in the Law of God
[20]  The Lord's Teaching in the New Testament Being "Blessed Are Those Who Are Persecuted Not Prosperous for the Sake of Righteousness"
[21]  VERSUS THE LAW IN MAN'S APPRECIATION 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 2:1-12; John 1:41; Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Heb 1:9; Acts 10:38; Dan 9:26a; Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5-6; Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5a; 2:26-27; Acts 4:25-29a; Rev 6:15-17; Acts 17:30; John 3:16; 21:15a
[22]  Psalm 1 is according to the human concept of uplifting and treasuring the law, whereas Psalm 2 is according to the divine concept of exalting Christ as God's central stress.
[23]  When we come to the Bible, we should not think that we are coming to an ordinary book.
[24]  We should not read it as we would a magazine or a newspaper.
[25]  We have to realize that the Bible is God's Word, and the Word is God's embodiment, Christ.
[26]  Also, whatever He as the Word of God utters, whatever is spoken out of His mouth, is the Spirit.
[27]  In this message, I want us to check with ourselves.
[28]  Is our spirit for the law or for Christ?
[29]  We may say that we are for Christ, but we are also for the law.
[30]  Mount Sinai produces children of slavery, but our mother, the Jerusalem above, is in the heavens, at Mount Zion vv.
[31]  We need to see the revelation concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation in the Psalms.
[32]  After passing through thirty-three and a half years of human living, Christ was cut off Dan 9:26 .
[33]  Psalm 2 also reveals that Christ was installed as God's King in the heavens in His ascension v. 6; Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5a . In verse 6, God declared, "I have installed My King/Upon Zion, My holy mountain." This was in Christ's ascension.
[34]  Psalm 2 also gives a warning to the world vv.
[35]  God and His Christ Being in Wrath to the World
[36]  The Bible tells us clearly that Christ is waiting for the opportunity to come to execute His judgment in His anger, in His wrath.
[37]  Thus far, we have covered Psalm 1 concerning the law in man's appreciation and Psalm 2 concerning Christ in God's economy.
[38]  In Ephesians 1 he said that he would ask the Father, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us vv.
[39]  As we have pointed out, Psalms 3 7 show us David's concepts concerning a godly life.
[40]  After Jehovah reproved him through the prophet Nathan 2 Sam 12:1-12 , David repented and was forgiven by God 2 Sam 12:13; Psa 51:1-17 .
[41]  David asked God to vindicate his righteousness based upon the past experience of his prayer.
[42]  He convinced others that he was a godly man whom God set apart for Himself and who called out to Jehovah and whom Jehovah heard when he called out to him.
[43]  David asked God to lift up upon him the light of His countenance, thanking God for putting joy in his heart more than others' rejoicing in the abounding of grain and new wine, and trusting in God to lie down and sleep in peace and dwell in safety Psa 4:6-8 .
[44]  Asking God to Let All Who Take Refuge in Him
[45]  David asked God to let all who take refuge in Him rejoice and shout for joy forever that God might spread a cover, a canopy, over them to cause those who love God's name to exult in God.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FIVE DAVID'S CONCEPTS CONCERNING A GODLY LIFE
[47]  In this message I would like to ask if we consider ourselves as babes and sucklings?
[48]  Perhaps some of us have a doctor's degree, or others are high school seniors.
[49]  On earth the Lord's name is excellent; above the heavens is the Lord's splendor, His glory.
[50]  In between there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger, who are stopped by the praise of strength that comes out of the mouths of the smallest ones and the weakest ones.
[51]  Psalm 8:5 says, "You have made him somewhat lower than angels/And have crowned him with glory and honor."
[52]  The word angels in Hebrew is Elohim, which is normally translated God Gen 1:1 .
[53]  Psalm 8:9 repeats the first part of verse 1 by saying, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth."
[54]  The psalmist may have been wrong grammatically, but the Spirit could never be wrong.
[55]  The Spirit inspired David to compose it this way, leaving an opening for us to fill in the main clause.
[56]  After he says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained," what should be said?
[57]  David's concept in these psalms is according to the law given by God alongside the central line of His economy.
[58]  David said that God has rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked, and uprooted their cities Psa 9:5-6 .
[59]  David said that the nations have sunk in the pit that they made; their own foot is caught in the net that they hid; the wicked have been snared in their own work; and all the nations who forget God will be turned back to Sheol Psa 9:15-17 .
[60]  After he presented the condition of man, he asked God to come to judge the wicked.
[61]  Psalm 13 shows that David took counsel with God that he might overcome his enemy.
[62]  In today's New Testament age, could we go to God and ask Him to put down our enemies, the ones that hate us?
[63]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE SEVEN WHAT KIND OF MAN MAY DWELL WITH GOD
[64]  Psalm 16, on the other hand, is a psalm revealing the God-man, Christ.
[65]  Psalm 16:1 does not say, "Preserve Me, O God, for I keep the law, and I meditate in the law day and night."
[66]  Verse 7a says, "I will bless Jehovah, who counsels Me."
[67]  Do you like to have someone as your counselor?
[68]  We need to notice that in this whole psalm, Psalm 16, nothing concerning good and evil is mentioned.
[69]  The revelation in Psalm 16 is far beyond our natural understanding.
[70]  From the day we were born, we were always taught to take care of good and evil.
[71]  We need to consider the book of Psalms in the light of these two lines.
[72]  If we are the appreciators of the law, as David was in Psalm 1, we are on the line of good and evil.
[73]  I. DAVID'S CONCEPT PSALM 15 A. According to the Law Given by God at Sinai
[74]  Psalm 16:1-8 reveals the God-man, Christ, in His human living.
[75]  He is not merely a good man, but a God-man.
[76]  Having Delight in the Saints, the Excellent on the Earth
[77]  In Psalm 16:9-10 we see the revelation of the God-man, Christ, in His death Acts 2:26-27 .
[78]  Now we come to the third stage of Christ in Psalm 16 His resurrection Psa 16:10-11a; Acts 2:27-28a .
[79]  Psalm 16 finally reveals the God-man, Christ, in His ascension v. 11b & c; Acts 2:28b .
[80]  Christ is in God's presence participating in fullness of joy, indicating that Christ has ascended to the heavens for His attainments and His obtainments Psa 16:11b; Acts 1:11; Phil 2:9-11 .
[81]  In His ascension Christ is enjoying pleasures forever in God's right hand, indicating that Christ is also at the right hand of God in His ascension to surpass all for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy concerning the church, the Body of Christ Psa 16:11c; Eph 1:20b-23 .
[82]  God also begot Him in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God.
[83]  The God-man Christ in His human living, His death, His resurrection, and His ascension is the centrality and universality of the economy of God, the man who may dwell with God for His heart's desire and good pleasure.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE EIGHT THE LINES, THE PRINCIPLES, AND THE SPIRIT
[85]  In order to help us understand the book of Psalms and even the entire Bible, we need to see the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible concerning Christ and the law.
[86]  The book of Genesis reveals that God created man in His image so that He could have a vessel to contain Him for His expression 1:26-28; 2:7-9 .
[87]  The two trees set before man after man's creation signify God and God's enemy, His opposite.
[88]  We have seen that in these psalms he justifies himself and mentions his righteousness frequently.
[89]  He asks the Lord to hear him and remember him because of his righteousness.
[90]  We need to ask whether David's righteousness as an offering to God is from the crop, as from Cain, or from the flock, as from Abel.
[91]  Cain was a God-worshipper who offered something to God, but what he offered according to his way was not acceptable to God.
[92]  When the descendants of Abraham became the race of Israel, God brought them to Mount Sinai.
[93]  At Mount Sinai God's intention was to train them to be His people to serve Him with a tabernacle, with a priesthood, and with all kinds of offerings.
[94]  The church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 , the counterpart of Christ, the complement of Christ, to be God's dwelling on the earth, typified by the tabernacle Exo 25:8-9; Josh 18:1; 1 Sam 1:3 and the temple 1 Kings 6:1 , both of which are considered as the house of God Judg.
[95]  There are many principles in the Bible and of the Bible which can help us to understand the Bible in a proper way.
[96]  To understand the Old Testament, you need to keep one principle; and to understand the New Testament, you need to keep another principle.
[97]  We need to see the principles of the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments.
[98]  The tabernacle Exo 25:8-9; 40:1-2 as the precursor of the temple 1 Kings 6:1 , the priesthood Exo 28:1 , and the offerings Lev 1 7 , all as types of Christ, were ordained by God to be the main line for God's chosen people to worship God, serve God, contact God, and partake of God until Christ as the fulfillment of all the types came Heb 9:8-12 .
[99]  In the Godhead, Christ is the first; in the old creation, Christ is the first; in the new creation, Christ is the first; and in the church as the Body of Christ, Christ is the first.
[100]  In the past two years, we have released messages on Isaiah, Daniel, Zechariah, and Jeremiah.
[101]  It is not easy to see Christ in these four books.
[102]  How many people see God's economy in these four books with Christ as the centrality and universality?
[103]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE NINE DAVID'S CONCEPT
[104]  In Psalms 17 19 we see David's concept concerning a man before God.
[105]  David said that his thoughts did not pass through his mouth and that his prayer was not made with "lips of deceit" v. 1 . James, in the New Testament, said that the hardest thing for us to control is our mouth James 3:1-12 . But in Psalm 17, David told God that he had success in controlling his mouth.
[106]  At the end of Psalm 17, we can see David's improvement in the satisfaction with God's likeness presence , yet he was still remaining in his righteousness before God v. 15 . How could David boast of his righteousness when he committed such a sinful act by taking Bathsheba and murdering her husband, Uriah? God forgave David of this great sin, but He did not forget what David did.
[107]  Psalm 18 is a psalm of David expressing his concept.
[108]  The title of this psalm says that David talked to Jehovah with the words of this song after God delivered him from all his enemies and from Saul.
[109]  This psalm is not merely a prayer or praise but a talk with God.
[110]  Psalm 18 reveals the improvement of David's concept in his enjoyment of the saving God as his strength, his crag, his fortress, his Deliverer, his God, his rock, his shield, his salvation's horn, and his high tower in whom he took refuge vv.
[111]  Even though David realized that God heard his voice from His temple, he portrayed God not as in His temple but as in His fury and His terrifying majesty vv.
[112]  Psalms 20 and 21 reveal David's concept concerning his kingship before God.
[113]  In Psalm 21, David praises Jehovah for his kingship and speaks of God's furious dealing with his enemies.
[114]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TEN THE CHRIST WHO HAS PASSED THROUGH
[115]  Generally speaking, we love every psalm because every psalm is full of an aspiration to seek after God, to pray to Him, to contact Him, and to receive the spiritual help from Him.
[116]  Verses 1-21 show us Christ passing through the redeeming death.
[117]  After passing through His redeeming death, Christ entered into the church-producing resurrection Psa 22:22-31 .
[118]  C. Declaring the Father's Name to His Brothers and Praising the Father in the Church
[119]  In resurrection Christ declared the Father's name to His brothers and praised the Father in the church.
[120]  Hebrews 2:11-12 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.'"
[121]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE ELEVEN CHRIST AS THE SHEPHERD IN HIS RESURRECTION
[122]  Psalms 22 24 are a group of psalms revealing Christ from His crucifixion to His kingship in the coming age.
[123]  In Psalm 22 we see Christ's death, His resurrection, and His many brothers produced in His resurrection to form His church.
[124]  Thus, in these three psalms, we have Christ crucified, Christ resurrected, Christ producing the church, Christ being the Shepherd and shepherding His flock, the church, and Christ coming back to be the King.
[125]  Verse 2 says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures."
[126]  The resurrected Christ shepherds us first in the initial stage of enjoyment in green pastures and at waters of rest Psa 23:1-2 .
[127]  Psalm 23:3 says, "He restores my soul;/He guides me on the paths of righteousness/For His name's sake."
[128]  We have to be right not only ethically, morally, but also materially.
[129]  Some young brothers who came into the church life in Los Angeles in the late sixties dressed in a wild way.
[130]  After being in the church life for a period of time, however, the way in which they dressed became proper, and their long hair and beards were cut.
[131]  Now we come to the fourth stage of the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ Psa 23:5 .
[132]  Surely goodness and kindness will follow us the grace of Christ and the love of God will be with us 2 Cor 13:14 all the days of our life in the present age .
[133]  Psalm 24 reveals Christ as the King in God's kingdom.
[134]  Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen four major stations concerning Christ Psalms 2, 8, 16, and 22 24.
[135]  It shows that Christ lived on this earth as a God-man, died on the cross, resurrected, and then ascended to the right hand of God.
[136]  In Psalm 2 the psalmist began to enjoy Christ to take refuge in this Christ and to kiss this Christ v. 12 . The highest and best enjoyment of human life is kissing.
[137]  In the ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem will be God's redeemed people to be the tabernacle to God for Him to enjoy His redeemed people, and the redeeming Triune God to be the temple to God's redeemed people for them to enjoy their redeeming Triune God in eternity.
[138]  Psalm 11:4 says that God is in His holy temple on His throne in heaven discerning with His eyes and trying the sons of men.
[139]  e. To Be Raised Up and Have His Head Lifted Up by God
[140]  I did not see before that this verse is in the portion of the Psalms which reveals the enjoyment of God in God's house.
[141]  We taste and see that God is good in His house, that is, in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem.
[142]  Sharing of the Fountain of the Life of God
[143]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[144]  A. Begging God Not to Let Him Be Put to Shame
[145]  and Not to Let His Enemies Exult over Him,
[146]  because of His Lifting Up His Soul to God,
[147]  David was assured that God, being good and upright, instructs sinners concerning the way Psa 25:8 .
[148]  David said that he turned his eyes continually to God that God might bring his feet out of the net and would turn toward him, be gracious to him, relieve the troubles of his heart, bring him out of his distresses, and look on his affliction and suffering vv.
[149]  Then he asked God to preserve him, not because of God's redemption and compassions but because of his integrity and uprightness, for he waited on God v. 21 . He said that he walked in integrity, walked in uprightness, and waited on God.
[150]  Psalm 26 reveals the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him.
[151]  Psalm 27 is the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his trusting in God for His protection and deliverance from his enemies.
[152]  At the end of Psalm 27, David advised and encouraged others to wait on God and to be strong and encouraged in their heart v. 14 . This is good, but it is altogether human activity which is not according to the standard of God's economy.
[153]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[154]  The New Testament charges us to believe into Christ, the Son.
[155]  Many will not translate this Greek word as into, because they say that this is not good English.
[156]  They maintain that into should be translated as in. In other words, we are to believe in Christ.
[157]  Psalm 28 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in calling God to hear the voice of his supplications.
[158]  A. Asking God, His Rock, Not to Be Deaf and Silent to Him When He Cried Out to Him
[159]  David also asked God, as the strength of His people and as the stronghold of salvation to His anointed, to save His people, bless His inheritance, shepherd them, and carry them forever vv.
[160]  C. Admiring God as the One Enthroned at the Flood
[161]  David also admired God as the One enthroned at the Flood and sitting as King forever v. 10 .
[162]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[163]  David said, "But I trust in You, O Jehovah;/I say, You are my God./My times are in Your hand" vv.
[164]  B. Exhorting the Godly Ones to Pray with Confession
[165]  Verse 6 says, "Because of this let everyone who is godly/Pray to You at a time when You may be found;/Surely when great waters overflow,/They will not reach him."
[166]  He confessed his sin, but he also indicated that he did not have any deceit in his spirit, that he was a godly one, and that he was seeking God at the time when God might be found.
[167]  Psalm 33 is the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in praising and giving thanks to God.
[168]  In verses 10-15 the psalmist praised God in His relationship with the sons of men on earth.
[169]  Now I would like to speak a word concerning the difference between Christ and the law.
[170]  The difference between Christ and the law is the difference between the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy.
[171]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[172]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house.
[173]  Our understanding of the Bible depends upon the measure of our growth in the spiritual life.
[174]  Even today in our human life, our knowledge depends upon the measure of our growth in the human life.
[175]  Psalm 34 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house in blessing and praising God.
[176]  To praise God is to give the honor and the glory to God.
[177]  Verses 7-22 show us David's advising and teaching others to fear God and take refuge in Him.
[178]  According to our concept, we may feel that the Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments, tells us mainly that we have to fear God, to take refuge in Him, to trust in Him, to wait on Him, to hope in Him, to praise Him, to thank Him, and to worship Him.
[179]  In the Lord's recovery, we have been enlightened to see what God wants.
[180]  God lives in us, and He wants us to live Him.
[181]  The main item in Paul's fourteen Epistles is stated in Galatians 2:20: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
[182]  Eventually, we saw the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.
[183]  The compound ointment takes olive oil as a base compounded with four kinds of spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.
[184]  The one hin of olive oil refers to God as the Spirit, and this divine Spirit is compounded with Christ's death, with the effectiveness of Christ's death, with Christ's resurrection, and with the power of Christ's resurrection.
[185]  The Bible reveals all of these things to let us know how God can be one with man and how man can be one with God.
[186]  Today we live as a man, yet we also live as God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead.
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[188]  IN HIS SUFFERING OF GOD'S DEALING A. David's Concept in This Psalm
[189]  Psalm 38:9-20 shows that David's environment compelled him to groan before God and declare his iniquity and sin.
[190]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS
[191]  Surely God takes care of us, but the apostle Paul did not write anything in his Epistles to tell us that God took care of him like a nurse to sustain him on his sickbed and to make his bed in every way.
[192]  David referred to God the mistreatment of his enemies.
[193]  Psalm 41:5-9 says, "My enemies speak evil against me:/When will he die and his name perish?/And if he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood./His heart gathers iniquity to itself;/When he goes out, he speaks it./All who hate me whisper together against me;/Against me they devise my misfortune./Some evil illness, they say, is cast upon him;/And when he lies down, he will not rise again./Even my familiar friend, in whom I trusted,/Who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me."
[194]  Seemingly Psalm 40:6-8 was the word of David, but actually it is the word of Christ.
[195]  Christ said to God, "You do not delight in sacrifice and offering;/You have bored My ears;/You do not require burnt offering and sin offering./Then I said,/Behold, I have come;/In the scroll of the book/It is written concerning Me./I delight in doing Your will, O My God;/Indeed Your law is within My inward parts" lit.
[196]  I believe that the translators of the Septuagint realized that to bore the ears was to require the obedience of Christ, and Christ's obedience was mainly for Him to die on the cross.
[197]  For Him to die on the cross, He needed a human body.
[198]  Hebrews 2:14 says that because Christ was going to destroy Satan, He needed to partake of blood and flesh, that is, He needed a body.
[199]  The prophecy in Psalm 40 concerning Christ should be considered the fifth station of all the prophecies concerning Christ in Book One of the Psalms.
[200]  Psalms 2, 8, 16, and 22 24 are the first four stations.
[201]  In the fifth station, Christ came through His incarnation to terminate God's old economy and initiate God's new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant.
[202]  Then the Lord Jesus told Peter that he was blessed because flesh and blood did not reveal this to him, but the Father in the heavens v. 17 . The Lord went further to tell the disciples that He was going to the cross v. 21 , but Peter began to rebuke Him, telling Him, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" v. 22 . When Peter said this, the Lord said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan!" v. 23 . At one moment Peter was blessed to receive a heavenly revelation of Christ from the Father, but in the next moment he was one with Satan.
[203]  As we have pointed out, Psalm 41:9 is a prophecy concerning Judas Iscariot betraying Christ.
[204]  Psalm 8 reveals that as the embodiment of God, Christ has brought God into man in His incarnation and man into God in His resurrection, thus bringing heaven to the earth and joining the earth to heaven to be the excellent One in all the earth.
[205]  Psalm 16 reveals that as the God-man, mingled with divinity and humanity, Christ took God as His portion, being obedient to God unto death, resurrecting into glory, ascending to His heavenly attainments and obtainments, and sitting at the right hand of God for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy concerning the church, the Body of Christ.
[206]  In resurrection He became the Shepherd of God's flock, leading the sheep of God to participate in the church as the house of God in this age, consummating in the New Jerusalem in the coming age and in the eternal age; and He will be God's triumphant King of glory to reign in God's eternal kingdom.
[207]  Thus far in our fellowship, we have covered Book One of the Psalms, composed of the first forty-one psalms.
[208]  Book One of the Psalms has turned the psalmists from the law to Christ, and Christ has brought them to the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city.
[209]  On the other hand, he was recalling the glorious and pleasant past in the leading of the festal multitude to enjoy God in His house with His people.
[210]  The psalmist remembered God from a distance from the land of the Jordan and the Hermons, from Mount Mizar, quite far from Zion and Jerusalem, where God's house and city were.
[211]  Psalm 42:6 says, "O my God, my soul is bowed down within me;/Therefore I remember You/From the land of the Jordan and the Hermons,/From Mount Mizar."
[212]  While the psalmist was enjoying God in His house and His city, a lot of things came into his thoughts to distract him.
[213]  Such believers need to consider the book of Hebrews.
[214]  Hebrews is a book not on Christ's love but on the kingdom.
[215]  The first is the good word of God 6:5 , the word of the beginning of Christ v. 1 , which is the milk the believers taste when they believe in the Lord 5:13 . The second kind of word is the word of righteousness v. 13 , which is solid food v. 14 , embodying the thought of God's justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people.
[216]  In verse 2 the psalmist praises the King signifying Christ in His fairness.
[217]  IN HIS HOUSE AND CITY THROUGH THE SUFFERING, EXALTED, AND REIGNING CHRIST 3 PRAISING CHRIST AS THE KING 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 45:9-17
[218]  Psalm 45 can be considered the sixth station in the unveiling of Christ in the Psalms.
[219]  An example of a biblical symbol or photograph is the tree of life in Genesis 2 and 3.
[220]  Rather, the tree of life is a symbol of God as the source and reality of life.
[221]  If we are enlightened and renewed, we will realize that Psalm 45 is lovable.
[222]  First, in verses 2 through 7, this psalm praises the king, Solomon, in his fairness, in his victory, in his kingdom, and in the sweetness of his virtues.
[223]  The queen is not alone but is accompanied by the daughters of kings v. 9 and by the virgins, her friends v. 14 . If we view this as a type, we will see that the king typifies Christ, that the queen typifies the church, and that those around the queen typify the believers.
[224]  at the King's Right Hand in the Gold of Ophir
[225]  In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we are told that God has made Christ to be righteousness to us for our justification, for us to be justified by God.
[226]  First we, the believers of Christ, take Christ as our abode, and then we become His abode.
[227]  Thus far in Psalm 45 we have seen the praising of Christ in Himself and the praising of Christ in the praising of His church, of His redeemed.
[228]  We need to see not only the beauty of Christ that is in Christ Himself and the beauty of Christ that is in the church but also the beauty of Christ that is in all His descendants, all His members, as the princes.
[229]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE PSALMISTS' INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT OF GOD
[230]  He has a body, made from the dust of the ground; he has a spirit, the issue of the breath of God; and he has a soul v. 7 . The man thus formed by God was put in a garden in Eden and placed before two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[231]  Furthermore, in Genesis 2 we are told that God took a rib out of the man and used it to make a woman.
[232]  Psalm 46 speaks concerning a river gladdening the city of God.
[233]  "There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, /The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High" v. 4 . This river signifies the flowing of the Triune God as life to us, as mentioned in Revelation 22.
[234]  In Psalm 47 the psalmist speaks concerning God as a great King over all the earth.
[235]  This enjoyment of God is through Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and it is in the church and in the local churches in the universal church as the Body of Christ and in the local churches as the expressions of the Body.
[236]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THREE CATEGORIES OF PERSONS
[237]  REGARDING THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 49 51
[238]  Those in the first category have no share in the enjoyment of God in Christ; those in the second category participate in the enjoyment of God; and the one in the third category has a full portion of the enjoyment of God in Christ.
[239]  If we want to have the full enjoyment of God in Christ, we must be like the one in Psalm 51, the one who thoroughly repented and confessed his sins to God.
[240]  Those who trust in their wealth are unable to redeem their brothers, needless to say themselves vv.
[241]  In Psalm 50 we have the second category of persons regarding the enjoyment of God in Christ those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant.
[242]  If we pray to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, this means that we pray to God by Christ as our sacrifice.
[243]  Those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant are those who have been redeemed by God in Christ, typified by the sacrifices.
[244]  Just as the shining of the sun is a dispensing of the sun's goodness, so the shining forth of God out of His house is a dispensing of His goodness.
[245]  To Restore to Him the Gladness of His Salvation
[246]  If we are those who repent, confess our sins, and ask God for His purging, we will have the enjoyment of God in Christ in His house, the local church, and in His city, the universal church.
[247]  "Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one?/God's lovingkindness endures continually" v. 1 . Who is this mighty one? Why, after referring to the mighty man, does the psalmist immediately go on to speak of God's lovingkindness? There seems to be no connection here.
[248]  Although David does not say that God will curse this one, he says, "God will likewise bring you down forever;/He will take you and pluck you up from your tent,/And uproot you from the land of the living" v. 5 . David's word here is very strong.
[249]  On the one hand, David enjoyed God in His house, even as an olive tree flourishing in the dwelling of God; on the other hand, in his prayer he condemned the evil man, saying that God would uproot him from the land of the living.
[250]  In verse 6 we see that the psalmist wanted to enjoy God in His salvation from His house when God turned the captivity of His people.
[251]  While the psalmist was under the oppression and persecution of his enemy, he recalled his enjoyment of God with the throng in the house of God Psa 55:14 .
[252]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE PIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF THE PSALMISTS
[253]  He prays that God would set him on high, secure from those who rose up against him v. 1b . Verses 9 and 10 indicate that the psalmist prayed by watching for God.
[254]  We should not follow the Psalms blindly, for they are not the absolute pattern up to the level of the New Testament standard for us to follow.
[255]  Instead of following the Psalms, we should appreciate them for the help they give us the help of being a background for the revelation of the all- inclusive Christ.
[256]  Christ is the centrality and universality of God's economy, and He is the perfect One whom we should pursue.
[257]  Some have been misled to such an extent that, as the Lord Jesus said, they have thought that by killing the believers they were offering service to God John 16:2 .
[258]  In verses 5 through 8 we have the psalmist's enjoyment of God.
[259]  He declares that his soul is satisfied with the rich fatness and that when he remembers God while on his bed and considers Him in the night watches, his mouth praises God with lips of joyous shouting vv.
[260]  "All men will fear/And declare God's doing,/And they will ponder what He has done./The righteous man will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in Him,/And all the upright in heart will boast" vv.
[261]  The psalmist begins by advising the earth to shout joyfully to God, to sing forth the glory of His name, to make glorious His praise, and to say to God, "How awesome are Your deeds!" vv.
[262]  In expressing his gratitude to God for the past, the psalmist says that He turned the sea into dry land v. 6 , that He rules by His might forever v. 7 , that He has kept their soul in life v. 9 , and that He has brought them forth into abundance v. 12 . Then the psalmist says, "I will come into Your house with burnt offerings;/I will repay my vows to You,/Which my lips uttered/And my mouth spoke when I was in distress./I will offer to You burnt offerings of fatlings /With the smoke of rams;/I will offer bullocks with goats" vv.
[263]  In verses 1 and 2 the psalmist asks God to be gracious to them, to bless them, and to make His face to shine upon them, that His way may be known on earth and His salvation among all the nations.
[264]  This indicates that without Acts 13 we cannot understand Psalm 2 and that without Psalm 2 we do not have the ground to declare, as the New Testament does, that Christ as the only begotten Son of God was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God.
[265]  In order to learn anything, we need both the capacity to learn and the proper instruction to help us learn.
[266]  Students in a university may study the same book, but how much they learn will differ according to their capacity and according to the kind of teaching they receive from their professors.
[267]  OF GOD'S MOVE ON THE EARTH 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 68:1-18; Num 9:15a; 10:35; Eph 4:8, 11-12; 6:12; 2:22
[268]  To illustrate further how hard it is to understand Psalm 68, let us also consider verses 25 through 27.
[269]  "Singers go before; players after;/In the midst of virgins sounding the tambourines./Bless God in the congregations,/Even Jehovah, O you who are of the fountain of Israel./There are little Benjamin, who rules them,/And the princes of Judah in their company, /The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali."
[270]  The tabernacle built and erected at Mount Sinai was a type of Christ as the real tabernacle.
[271]  This real tabernacle was set up through Christ's incarnation.
[272]  John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality.
[273]  Whereas the tabernacle built up by Israel under Moses was a type, or a shadow, Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, is the real tabernacle for God's dwelling on the earth and for God's people to contact Him and dwell with Him.
[274]  Psalm 68 is about God's move within the tabernacle typifying Christ as His dwelling place with the ark typifying Christ as the center.
[275]  This move of God began after the rearing up of the tabernacle of the ark, signifying Christ incarnated to be the dwelling place of God on the earth with Himself as the center for God's move in His economy John 1:14a; Num 9:15a .
[276]  In verse 1 we have the prayer of Moses, the representative of God's elect, for Jehovah to arise and for His enemies to be scattered v. 14 . The enemies here typify Satan and his forces in the heavenlies Eph 6:12 . This prayer was actually the aspiration of all God's elect people.
[277]  "Dove" signifies the Spirit with His moving and soaring power; "white silver" signifies Christ in His all-inclusive redemption for His believers' justification as the entrance into His full salvation; and "greenish yellow gold" signifies God in His nature glittering in His life and glory.
[278]  On the other hand, we are restfully enjoying our portion in Christ, enjoying the Triune God the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold.
[279]  This indicates that Christ uses all the gifts to build up the dwelling place for God.
[280]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST AS THE CENTER
[281]  The carrying out of God's economy actually began with the incarnation of Christ.
[282]  John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.
[283]  This indicates that the incarnation brought in the real and living tabernacle, which was Christ Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[284]  However, without that type, God could not have had, with the children of Israel, a type of His move on the earth in Christ.
[285]  At the very time we confessed our sins and believed in Christ, we received the Spirit with God, Christ, and the divine life the riches, the spoil, gained by Christ through His victory.
[286]  In the first section five matters are covered: God's move on the earth, God's victory in Christ, Christ's ascension, Christ's receiving the gifts, and Christ's building up the house of God.
[287]  This brings us to the first item in the second section the enjoyment of God in His house vv.
[288]  "They have seen Your goings, O God,/The goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary" v. 24 . Here "they" refers to the enemies, to the unbelievers; "goings" refers to God's activities; and the "sanctuary" signifies the church.
[289]  In the praise rendered to God by His elect, there is portrayed a scenery in typology concerning God's New Testament economy in the accomplishment of God's redemption for His salvation by Christ and in the spreading of the glad tidings of Christ's accomplishment with the goodly words of the gospel.
[290]  The next matter in Psalm 68 is the spreading from the temple into the city of God.
[291]  This word indicates that following God's strengthening of what He has done for His elect, the influence of the enjoyment of God in His house would spread to the entire city of Jerusalem because of the house of God, which was at Jerusalem.
[292]  and Cush Quickly Stretching Out Its Hand to God
[293]  Verse 31 indicates that nobles will come out of Egypt to visit Jerusalem, the city of God, and that Cush today's Ethiopia will quickly stretch out its hand to God.
[294]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE SUFFERING CHRIST AND THE REIGNING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 69 72
[295]  In this message we will consider Psalms 69 through 72.
[296]  Whereas Psalms 69 and 72 are on Christ, Psalms 70 and 71 are typical examples of psalms that are the pious expressions uttered out of the complex sentiments of the psalmists.
[297]  Psalm 71 is about the psalmist's trust in God and his praise to God.
[298]  "Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel,/Who alone does wondrous deeds;/And blessed be His glorious name forever;/And may His glory fill the whole earth./Amen and Amen" vv.
[299]  The basis for my speaking about the Psalms in this way is the New Testament with its twenty-seven books.
[300]  The New Testament tells us that we have been crucified Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 .
[301]  Since we have been crucified and even buried Rom 6:4 , there is no need for us to fear God.
[302]  Since we have been crucified and Christ now lives in us, it is no longer a matter of "I" fearing God or trusting in Him.
[303]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 is not for us to fear God or to keep the law but for us to live Christ in order that Christ might be magnified vv.
[304]  The New Testament also reveals that when Christ died, He ended the old creation.
[305]  On the third day He was resurrected, and through His resurrection He regenerated us 1 Pet 1:3 to be a new man, not a man of Adam and in Adam but a man of Christ and in Christ.
[306]  In the church we are being helped to realize, with Paul, that we have been crucified, that it is no longer we who live, that Christ lives in us, and that now we should care only for one thing to live Christ that we may magnify Christ.
[307]  God wants only those virtues that are in Christ and of Christ, the virtues that come by living Christ and magnifying Christ.
[308]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY THE DESOLATION OF GOD'S HOUSE
[309]  In particular, Paul completed the word of God in regard to the mystery of God, which is Christ Col 2:2 , and the mystery of Christ, which is the church Eph 3:4 .
[310]  Revelation 22:18 and 19 tell us that, since the divine revelation has been completed, no one is allowed to add to it or take away from it.
[311]  In other words, the Bible itself makes it clear that the entire revelation has been completed and closed, and no one is permitted to claim, as the Mormons do, that additional revelation has been given to them.
[312]  Today's Christians commonly say that every word of the Bible from Genesis 1:1 through Revelation 22:21 is the word of God.
[313]  I believe that the Bible is wholly inspired by God but not that every word in the Bible is a word by God.
[314]  Surely, the word of the serpent to Eve in Genesis 3 is not a word by God, and it would be a great mistake to say that it is.
[315]  No doubt, every word out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is a word out of the mouth of God, and such a word is the divine revelation directly given.
[316]  It may be hard for some to believe that the temple, God's house, was desolated, but it was desolated to such an extent that it was burned, and the city surrounding it was ruined.
[317]  Whereas Psalm 73 is on the sufferings of the seeking saints, Psalm 74 is on the desolation of the house of God.
[318]  Psalm 75 is concerned with the judgment of Christ upon the desolators.
[319]  Some may wonder how with respect to this psalm I can speak of the judgment of Christ, since this psalm does not mention Christ or the Messiah.
[320]  The basis for my speaking here is the fact that, according to John 5:22, God has given all judgment to Christ the Son.
[321]  V. THE VICTORY OF GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE
[322]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE WAY OF RESTORATION EXALTING CHRIST
[323]  PSALMS 77 83 Scripture Reading: Psa 77:7-13; 78:65-66, 68-69; 79:1; 80:14-15, 17-19; 82:8; 83:2-5, 12, 18
[324]  In that battle the people of Israel were defeated, and the ark of God was captured by the Philistines v. 11 . God, however, came in to protect the ark, and it was returned 1 Sam 5 6 . Eventually, David defeated the enemies of Israel and prepared both the site and the materials for the building of the temple, even giving the design of the temple to his son Solomon.
[325]  In Psalm 77 we are told that God's way is in the sanctuary and His way is in the sea and His paths are in the great waters.
[326]  God's way is hidden in the sea, and His paths in the great waters with His footsteps are not known to men v. 19 , but His way is revealed in His sanctuary v. 13 . The thought here is similar to that in Psalm 73 where the psalmist, puzzled by the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the seeking saints, said, "When I considered this in order to understand it,/It was troublesome in my sight,/Until I went into the sanctuary of God;/Then I perceived their end" vv.
[327]  to Visit His Vine for the Sake of Christ
[328]  In verses 14 through 19 the psalmist asks God to visit His vine for the sake of Christ as the Man of His right hand.
[329]  Today, as we visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we need to tell them that Christ, the Son of God, became a man, died on the cross for their sins, resurrected, and ascended to the right hand of God in the heavens, and now they need to call upon Him.
[330]  to Judge the Earth and to Inherit the Nations
[331]  In verse 8 we have the aspiration of the psalmist for Christ to judge the earth and to inherit the nations: "Arise, O God; judge the earth;/For You will inherit all the nations."
[332]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE PSALMIST'S LOVE
[333]  In this message we will consider Psalm 84, which is concerned with the psalmist's love for the house of God with Christ.
[334]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE A SUPPLEMENT
[335]  TO MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO ON PSALM 84 Scripture Reading: Psa 84
[336]  The Old Testament indicates that God is triune Gen 1:1, 26; Isa 6:1-3, 8 , but the God unveiled in the Old Testament is not the incarnated Triune God.
[337]  This is the Triune God coming into man to make Himself one with man, to make Himself humanly divine as the God-man named Jesus vv.
[338]  It was only since the resurrection of Christ, who is the incarnated Triune God, that the Spirit of God began to have the capacity to give the divine life to human beings, for it was in resurrection that Christ Himself became the life-giving Spirit.
[339]  We have pointed out that in Psalm 84 there is a secret revelation concerning our enjoyment of the incarnated Triune God.
[340]  We thank the Lord that in the recovery, in the church life, the Christ we enjoy is the incarnated Triune God.
[341]  We need to see that Christ is not only the embodiment of God but also that Christ is the incarnated Triune God.
[342]  The highways to Zion are the blessed highways for seeking the incarnated Triune God in His consummations comprising the washing laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark of the testimony .
[343]  From our spiritual experiences we have learned that, on the one hand, we have entered into God, but, on the other hand, we are still on the way to enter into God.
[344]  SOME FURTHER MATTERS A. Our Shield and God's Anointed
[345]  Psalm 84:9 says, "Behold, our shield, O God,/And look upon the face of Your anointed."
[346]  In verse 4 the psalmist prays, "Restore us, O God of our salvation,/And cause Your indignation toward us to cease."
[347]  Whereas Psalm 85 is on the seeking of the sons of Korah for restoration and Psalm 86 is on the seeking of David for salvation, Psalm 87 is on the desire of God for Zion with Christ.
[348]  Babylon was famous in the realm of human success and glory.
[349]  It was the continuation of Babel, where man endeavored to glorify himself by building a tower to heaven.
[350]  Our seeking and our praying will not touch God's heart because God's heart is for Christ with Zion, in which are many saints and which is for the house of God and the city of God for Christ to possess the whole earth.
[351]  God saves people for His Christ, for His Zion, and for His house and His city in order that one day He might gain the entire earth through Christ with His overcomers.
[352]  Psalm 89 unveils Christ as God's Anointed to possess the entire earth, with His territory extending from the sea to all the rivers.
[353]  Of the seventeen psalms in Psalms Book 3, these five are outstanding, showing us that God is our unique portion and then showing us Christ, the saints, the house and the city, the local and universal church full of gates, full of fellowship, for God to move on to accomplish His eternal economy.
[354]  IN THE IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 90 92
[355]  Psalm 36:8 speaks of being saturated with the fatness of God's house and of drinking of the river of His pleasures, for with Him is the fountain of life v. 9a . Psalm 46:4a says, "There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God." In Psalm 48 we find expressions such as "the city of our God" v. 1 and "the city of the great King" v. 2 . In Psalm 72, the last Psalm in Book 2, we have a word about the earth.
[356]  In this message, entitled "The Saints' Deeper Experience of God in the Identification with Christ," we will consider Psalms 90 through 92.
[357]  Psalm 90 opens with a word concerning God as our dwelling place: "O Lord, You have been our dwelling place/In all generations."
[358]  To be sure, the Bible is the only book that tells us that God can be our dwelling place.
[359]  Psalms is a book on Christ a book on drinking Christ, eating Christ, breathing Christ, and dwelling in Christ.
[360]  To answer this question we need to read 91:9: "You have made Jehovah, who is my refuge,/Even the Most High, Your habitation."
[361]  To be identified with Christ is to be identified with Him not only in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension but also in His taking God as His habitation.
[362]  The only way that we can be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension is to abide in Christ, and to abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him but also to dwell in Him, taking Him as our everything.
[363]  Psalms Book 4 unveils the saints' deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ and God's recovery of His title and right over the earth.
[364]  This indicates that our experience of dwelling in God paves the way for Christ to come to posses the earth that God may recover His title and right over the earth.
[365]  This means that if we drink Christ, eat Christ, and breathe Christ without taking Christ as our habitation, God has no way to recover the earth.
[366]  The matter of the identification with Christ is unveiled in Psalm 91.
[367]  If we do not dwell in God, not taking God as our habitation, we may see many things, but these things will be insignificant.
[368]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX GOD'S RECOVERY OF HIS TITLE AND RIGHT
[369]  This indicates that God has given the earth to Christ as His possession and the nations as His inheritance.
[370]  Psalm 94 reveals that Christ will execute His judgment over the world.
[371]  Verses 2 and 3 say, "Jehovah has made His salvation known;/In the sight of the nations/He has revealed His righteousness./He remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness/Toward the house of Israel;/All the ends of the earth have seen/The salvation of our God."
[372]  Psalm 101 is a word spoken to God by Christ, who reigns on the earth for God.
[373]  At the psalmist's time the name of Christ, the anointed One, had not yet been revealed, so David, God's anointed, was used to typify Christ as the man anointed by God to reign over the earth for God.
[374]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE EARTH TURNING TO THE LORD
[375]  Verses 1 through 11 are the first section, concerned with suffering and affliction; verses 12 through 22 are the second section, concerned with the rebuilding of Zion, the restoration of the destroyed temple and holy city; and verses 23 through 28 are the third section, unveiling the Lord as the One who is everlasting in His resurrection.
[376]  In Revelation 1:18 Christ, the living One, says, "I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever."
[377]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 107 110
[378]  The Psalms is a very hard book for us to read because in our reading of it we can easily be seduced to care for things such as godliness and comfort.
[379]  The Bible is not mainly for godliness or comfort.
[380]  Rather, the Bible teaches us that Christ is the centrality of God's eternal economy to produce the church, first as God's house and then as God's kingdom, issuing in the millennial kingdom with full restoration for all the creation, which will consummate in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.
[381]  Have you ever thought that the Psalms is a book not mainly on godliness and comfort but on Christ with the house of God and the city of God leading to the restoration of the universe during the millennium and ushering us into the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem?
[382]  For example, it surely is significant that immediately after Psalm 1, which is on the Law, we have Psalm 2, which is on Christ, the Son of God and His anointed One.
[383]  We have seen that Psalm 102 unveils Christ as the key that turns the earth to the Lord and that Psalms 103 through 106 are a narration of God's history in His forgiving our sins, in His greatness in the creation of the universe and its fullness, in His dealing with Abraham and his descendants according to His covenant, and in His dealing with Israel in the wilderness and in the promised land.
[384]  Psalm 107 is on God's care and deliverance of His redeemed in Christ.
[385]  No doubt, God takes care of us every day, always delivering us, rescuing us, and saving us.
[386]  In Psalm 108 we see God's victory in Christ over the enemies.
[387]  In describing this victory, these verses say that God will divide Shechem, that He will measure out the Valley of Succoth, that Gilead and Manasseh are His, that Ephraim is the helmet for His head, that Judah is His scepter, that Moab is His washbowl, that upon Edom He will cast His sandal, and that over Philistia He will shout.
[388]  Although Psalm 110 is one of the shortest of the psalms, it is the highest revelation of Christ.
[389]  A. God Making Christ Sit at His Right Hand 1.
[390]  "Your young men will be to You/Like the dew from the womb of the morning" v. 3b . This indicates that, on the one hand, Christ likes to see the splendor of our consecration; on the other hand, He desires the dew that comes from the womb of the morning.

[392]  It is true to say that the law typifies Christ as a portrait of God.
[393]  The law is a portrait of God, and eventually this portrait is not merely the Ten Commandments but a living person, Christ.
[394]  Concerning Christ as the cornerstone, Acts 4:10-12 says, "Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health.
[395]  "So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."
[396]  In 1 Peter 2:4-7 we have another word about Christ as the cornerstone.
[397]  "Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[398]  For it is contained in Scripture: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious; and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.'
[399]  This indicates that Christ will come in the name of God, in the name of Jehovah.
[400]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY CHRIST THE REALITY OF THE LAW
[401]  AS THE TESTIMONY AND THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 119
[402]  SIGNIFIED BY: A. The Testimony of God, Signifying Christ
[403]  Christ is the reality of the law as the testimony of God.
[404]  According to Revelation 19:13b, when Christ comes back to judge, His name will be called "the Word of God."
[405]  As God's living testimony the law functions to minister the living God to His seekers Psa 119:2, 88 .
[406]  However, if we regard the law as God's testimony, as a portrait of God, and if we consider that every word of the law is something breathed out by God, then to us the law will be the living and loving word of God.
[407]  Then as we read the Bible we will touch God, knowing that He is loving and that it is surely worthwhile for us to love Him and to seek Him.
[408]  The second kind is the God-seekers, illustrated by the psalmists, especially by the writer of Psalm 119.
[409]  "Blessed are those who keep His testimonies,/Who seek Him with all their heart" v. 2 . The writer of this psalm was one who sought God with his whole heart.
[410]  In Psalm 119 many different verbs are used to express the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and God's word.
[411]  "How sweet are Your words to my taste!/Sweeter than honey to my mouth!" v. 103 . To the psalmist the law was not merely a list of commandments; it was also a word full of enjoyment and life supply.
[412]  If we regard the law as nothing more than the commandments of God, it will not be sweet to us.
[413]  IN THE EXPERIENCES AND PRAISES OF THE SAINTS 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 120 127
[414]  In this message we will begin to consider a particular group of psalms, Psalms 120 through 134, which are known as the Psalms of Ascents.
[415]  Psalm 122 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning his love of the house of God in Jerusalem.
[416]  Verses 3 through 5 are Jehovah's blessing to His people.

[419]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAINTS BEFORE JEHOVAH
[420]  Those who arranged the Psalms arranged them according to their contents.
[421]  In this arrangement we have Psalms 1 through 119, which speak about the law; Psalms 120 through 134, which are psalms about the going up, the ascending, to Zion; and the last sixteen psalms, Psalms 135 through 150.
[422]  The subject of Psalm 135 is the charging of the priests who serve Jehovah in His house, in the courts of His house, to praise Him for His virtues.
[423]  Because he was close to the Lord and because he had an intimate concern for the worship of God and for the priests, he charged the priests to worship God.
[424]  In verse 5 the psalmist says, "I know that Jehovah is great /And that our Lord is above all gods."
[425]  Then in verses 15 through 18 he explains, "The idols of the nations are silver and gold,/The work of human hands./They have mouths, but they do not speak;/They have eyes, but they do not see.
[426]  G. In His Executing of Judgment for His People
[427]  In verses 13 and 14 the psalmist charges the priests to praise Jehovah in His executing of judgment for His people and in His repenting concerning His servants for the sake of His name, which is His memorial throughout all generations.
[428]  the Earth over the Waters, and the Great Lights
[429]  Next, the psalmist charges the people to give thanks to God who by understanding made the heavens, who spread forth the earth over the waters, and who made the great lights, the sun to rule the day and the moon and the stars to rule the night vv.
[430]  In verses 10 through 16 we have a word about giving thanks to God who struck Egypt through their firstborn, who brought forth Israel from their midst with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, who divided the Red Sea apart, brought Israel over through the midst of it, and shook off Pharaoh and his force into it, and who marched His people through the wilderness.
[431]  Verses 13 through 18 indicate that the psalmist appreciated being created by God.
[432]  After speaking about God's creation, the psalmist declared, "How precious are Your thoughts to me, O God!/How great is the sum of them!/If I should count them, they would be more than the sand./When I awake, I am still with You" vv.
[433]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR FINAL PRAYERS OF DAVID TO JEHOVAH Scripture Reading: Psa 140 145
[434]  Before we begin to consider Psalms 140 through 145, I would like to say a word about hymn #960 in our hymnal.
[435]  As we sing this hymn, our heart is touched and we feel that the Lord is close to us and that we are close to Him.
[436]  In his final prayers David asked Jehovah for His deliverance and preservation 140:1-5; 141:9; 143:6, 9, 11; 144:7, 11 .
[437]  In 141:5b David said, "Still my prayer is against their evil deeds."
[438]  This indicates that David's enemies were doing evil things but that David's prayer was against these evil things.
[439]  In 143:8 David went on to pray that Jehovah would cause him to hear His lovingkindness in the morning, for he trusted in Him.
[440]  Then David prayed that Jehovah would make known to him the way on which he should walk, for to Him he lifted up his soul, his whole being, not only his hand.
[441]  If we do not have such a heart toward the Lord, then all the higher and deeper things that I have been ministering since 1962 concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, the church as the Body of Christ, and God's eternal economy with the divine dispensing will not mean anything to us.
[442]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE CONSUMMATE PRAISE Scripture Reading: Psa 146 150
[443]  In this message we will cover the last five psalms, Psalms 146 through 150.
[444]  B. He Having Created Heaven, Earth, and All Things
[445]  Verse 6 says that Jehovah made heaven, earth, and the sea and all things in them and that He keeps faith forever.
[446]  Jehovah has restored Jerusalem, has strengthened its bars, and has blessed its people with peace and rich provision vv.
[447]  Psalm 149 is on praising Jehovah for His pleasure in His people, Israel, and His adornment of the lowly with salvation.
[448]  Verse 1 is a charge to praise God in His sanctuary and in the firmament of His power.
[449]  Based upon this principle we can say that the spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ Luke 24:44 as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God.
[450]  The consummation of this highest divine revelation is the city of New Jerusalem as a sign of the habitation, the tabernacle, of God Rev 21:1-3 , through which the Triune God is manifested and expressed in the all-inclusive Christ.
[451]  God desires to have an organic habitation on earth, and this habitation is the aggregate of the living saints gained by God through the terminating death and germinating resurrection of the all-inclusive Christ.
