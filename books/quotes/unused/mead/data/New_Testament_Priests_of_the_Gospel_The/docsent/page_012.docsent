   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH HAVING DEGRADED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HAVING DEPARTED FROM GOD S ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the new way is God s ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It matches what God wants to accomplish in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, although it is now the New Testament age and the church age, there is still the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason for this is the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not long after the church was established by the apostles and even before these apostles passed away, there were believers who had left the way brought in by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church became degraded, and its nature changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, the service, worship, and meeting of the church all changed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything became according to man s natural inclination resulting in fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The degradation of Christianity did not come about suddenly, but through a gradual decline.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Beginning from the second century, through the third century and extending to the sixth century, the degradation worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By A.D. 570 the archbishop of Rome was recognized by all the churches as the pope, and the Roman Catholic church was officially established.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After that the Catholic church sealed up the Bible and forbade the ordinary believers to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the pope and the clergy were allowed to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible was locked up, and this period is known in western history as the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the sixteenth century, Martin Luther rose up to begin the Reformation, and the sealed Bible was unlocked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was a great accomplishment of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Based on the Bible, he also recovered the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the ways of serving in the church and preaching the gospel remained unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From Catholicism, Protestantism developed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Early Protestantism was comprised of all the state religions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time the northern European countries all established their own national churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In England, it was the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Denmark, it was the national church of Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later, the private, independent churches, such as the Baptists and Methodists, developed from the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these are private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have nothing to do with individual countries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time there was a gradual recovery of the church, but the recovery was not that thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There were still many things which Protestantism had inherited from Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the eighteenth century, Brother Zinzendorf was raised up by the Lord to lead others to a recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the nineteenth century, there was a further recovery when the Brethren were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After another century, around 1920, the Lord raised up Brother Watchman Nee in the Far East in Fukien, China.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time I was in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we were far apart, the Lord gained both of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We loved the Lord and realized the real need to be delivered from the poison left by degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sixty years ago we thought that we were quite thoroughly delivered from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Lord enlightened us more and showed us that the degraded elements of Christianity had not been fully purged from us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seemed as if we had inherited these fallen elements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we tried hard to be sterilized, the germs never left us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can take the way we meet as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we mention the meetings, there is the hope within us that as many believers as possible should be gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A meeting of five hundred is better than one of one hundred, and eight hundred is better than five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, a thousand is even better than eight hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that you are all very happy this morning because both the upper floor as well as the ground floor is filled with people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are even those who are watching on closed-circuit television.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of you are listening to my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You cannot say that this kind of meeting has no place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament records that when Paul went to Troas he stayed there for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because he was about to leave on the following day, he talked with the believers until after midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One young man by the name of Eutychus fell down from the windowsill of the third floor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he was taken up, he was already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul went down and fell upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He told everyone that the young man s life was still in him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then Paul went up again and conversed with the congregation for a considerable time until daybreak and went away Acts 20:6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, there is occasion for this kind of meeting also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the Bible reveals to us that the regular meeting of the believers should be from house to house Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the day of Pentecost when three thousand people were saved, Peter and John only went occasionally to the temple to speak to the multitude there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most of the time they gathered from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During those gatherings it was not just one speaking while all others listened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, it was everyone speaking and everyone listening.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was fellowship, prayer, the breaking of bread, teaching, and the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All these were done in the meetings in the homes of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is also the original way ordained by God for the church to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because of the degradation of the church, this kind of meeting has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What one sees exclusively in Christianity today are big gatherings with one speaking and all the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They have all left God s ordained way and fallen into human tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This traditional way suits man s natural disposition and matches the spirit of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As early as 1948, Brother Watchman Nee said that this kind of gathering is like the Israelites following after the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not easy to see through this from the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is hymn singing, sermon teaching, and gospel preaching, and men are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It seems as if there is nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, what is hidden beneath is something contrary to the universal priesthood ordained by God.</S>
