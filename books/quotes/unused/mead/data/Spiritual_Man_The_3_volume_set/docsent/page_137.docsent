   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All the work that God calls us to do is revealed in the intuition of the spirit see Section Five, Chapter One .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer acts according to the thoughts of the mind, the activities of the emotion, and the ambitions of the will, he goes outside of the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; all the other things are not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of a believer's work must only come from receiving revelation in the spirit after trusting and waiting upon God; otherwise, the flesh will come in. God will surely give us the spiritual power to do everything that He calls us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, there is an important principle of never working beyond the strength in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we work beyond our spirit, we will draw on our own power for assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the beginning of misery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Overstretching in the work will prevent us from walking according to the spirit and from doing real spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Almost everyone today uses rationality, thoughts, reasons, emotions, feelings, likes, wishes, desires, etc., as the standard for work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But all of these are from the soul and have no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should know that these things are good servants, but they are not good masters; if we follow them, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritual work must come forth from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God will not reveal His will in any place other than in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, when people need spiritual help, the worker should never allow soulish feelings to overcome the spiritual relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Besides a completely pure desire to help their spirituality, other soulish feelings are damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is often a danger and snare to a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Love, affection, concern, worry, interest, fervency, etc., must all be completely guided by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they do not obey this law, some workers for Christ have moral and spiritual failures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, we may let natural attraction and human desire control our work; on the other hand, we may let natural hatred and a lack of human affection control our work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both cases the result will be failure, and the life of the worker will be desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times, even regarding the loved ones who are most dear to us, a relationship based upon the flesh must be placed in a secondary position, sometimes even completely disregarded, before spiritual results can be obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our intentions and wishes must be completely consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should work only when we know in the intuition that the work is according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh does not have a possibility of joining in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The extent of our spiritual usefulness depends on how deeply we let the cross cut our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Superficial accomplishments matter little; only the work that is done by God, through men and women who have been crucified, matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even works that are done in the name of the Lord Jesus with fervency and labor, for the sake of some good cause or for the mission of the kingdom of the heavens, are not sufficient to cover up the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God only wants Himself to do the work; He does not want the flesh to interfere with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should realize that even in the matter of serving God, there is the possibility of offering "strange fire" and of being "not spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will stir the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of the fire that is not kindled in our spirit by the Holy Spirit is strange fire and sin in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every work which is done for God is not necessarily the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Doing something for Him is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The real question is who is doing it?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God Himself does not work from the spirit of the believer, and there is only the activity of a believer using his own strength, then the work cannot count before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything out of the flesh will decay with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only that which comes from God will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only doing the work which God commanded will not be in vain.</S>
