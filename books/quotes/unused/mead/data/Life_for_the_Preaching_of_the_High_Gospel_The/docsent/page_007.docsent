   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I wish to put these things in a more simple and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Look at the situation of today's human life and society.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>People all over the world are materialistic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are busily working to gain material things for a good living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They want to have better food, a better house, a better car, and better clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the time they are seeking for something better.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But eventually what they seek for becomes bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>America today is a materialistic country.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The materialistic people are the first category of people we see in today's society.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another category of people is composed of those who are trying to be good, to be moral.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When people become materialistic, they do not care much for morality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, generally speaking, materialistic people are not so moral.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But today on this earth there are some people who are highly moral.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we have a third category of people the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Christianity, to be religious is really wonderful; it is to be formal and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, in a general sense, the religious people are not only better than the materialistic people but also better than the moral people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fourth category of people, the highest category, is the spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be spiritual is to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, compared to the previous three categories of people, the spiritual people are really much better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE KIND OF PEOPLE GOD WANTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now let us ask what kind of people God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, God does not want a group of materialistic people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nor does He want a group of moral or religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, strictly speaking, God's intention is not to have a group of so-called spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants a group of people who would return to His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>SEEKING FIRST GOD'S KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 6:31-33 the Lord said, "Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are always thinking about the matters of eating, drinking, and clothing, you are materialistic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord told us to forget about these material things, which the Gentiles seek after all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we should seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen that the kingdom of God is the dominion of God, but what is the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be righteous is to be right with God and to be right according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is love, yet you hate others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since God is love, you also should love others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is faithful, yet you are unfaithful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God is faithful, so you also should be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is honest, yet you are dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be honest is to be right according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we can see that to be righteous simply means to be right according to God, not according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be right according to God is to be completely agreeable with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The young people should consider what they are seeking today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They should be seeking to be brought back to God's dominion, God's ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Day by day you should be brought under God's ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, while you are seeking God's kingdom, you should also seek His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This simply means that you have to return to God's dominion and to get yourself completely agreeable with God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to be agreeable with God, we need to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to have His life and become His children.</S>
