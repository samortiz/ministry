According to the revelation of the Word, the Lord's central thought and intention is to have the church as His Body to express Himself
The church is not merely a meeting; the church is not for a kind of activity; the church is not for a kind of service or for anything else
Christ is wrought into us through the Holy Spirit because Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the very reality of Christ
The church is for Christ, not even, strictly speaking, for the Holy Spirit, the teachings of the Word, or any gift
The problem throughout all the centuries and even today is that people pay their attention to certain teachings more than to Christ
The Presbyterian denomination, for example, came into being because some people stressed the government of the church by the presbytery
In the same way, we have the Baptist Church today because some people stressed baptism by immersion rather than Christ, creating a division
Today we also have the Pentecostal Church, because those people stress the Pentecostal things instead of Christ
Regardless of how many teachings we have and how good those teachings are we have to consider them simply as a means not as the central item
The teachings are more or less ordinary, and certain kinds of gifts are very ordinary, but there are also certain extraordinary gifts
They talk about gifts, but they may not know what the word gift really means or where in the Bible the gifts are dealt with
The gifts dealt with in this book are the persons the members of the Body such as apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
We may say that all are important, but there is no doubt that the talents, the ordinary gifts, and the persons as gifts are more important
They are for the beginning of a work in a new place, a new territory, where the name of Christ has never been preached
Paul told us that the Lord is within us all the time, but in Acts on that one occasion the Lord stood beside the apostle
As we have said, according to the book of Acts, the miraculous things are either for the beginning of a work or for a special occasion
We take the proper gifts as a means to convey Christ, but our attention is never on the teachings or on the gifts
Verses 5 and 6 continue, 'For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake
Verse 7 says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
The main item of the economy of God is that God's intention is to work Himself in His Triune person into all the parts of our being
Soda bottles are very definite and specific containers, because they are made with a definite and specific purpose
There are many things mentioned in the Scriptures, but all those items are not the basic item of the Scriptures
Portions in Exodus and Isaiah tell us clearly and definitely that God is one and in the New Testament 1 Timothy 25 says For there is one God
In the grammatical composition of Genesis 1:1, the Hebrew word for God, Elohim, is plural in number, while the predicate created is singular
In the whole universe, we have only one God; we do not have more than one God, yet the one God needs a plural pronoun to refer to Himself
The child mentioned in this prophecy is the very child born in the manger at Bethlehem, but this little child is called the mighty God
We cannot figure this out, but if we believe the authority of the Scriptures, we have to take the fact that a son is called the Father
If He were not God, how could He be called the mighty God, and how could the son be called the eternal Father?
Rather, we will simply stress that in carrying out His economy to work Himself into us, God is in three persons
Without being three-the person of the Father, the person of the Son, and the person of the Spirit-God could never work Himself into us
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
We may have the intention of eating a watermelon, or we may say, of working a watermelon into ourselves and into our family
The Word who was with God and who was God Himself became flesh, that is, became a man to dwell not within us but only among us
Finally at the end of this book, this wonderful One went to die and be resurrected, and He came to the disciples and breathed into them
Just as we must know the three persons of God by whom He works Himself into us, we also have to know the different parts of our being
Originally, a person or object is outside the camera, but after a picture is taken, that person or object is inside the camera
In order to do this, a camera needs three main things: a lens on the outside, film on the inside, and the shining of the light
Many times, even in the gospel message meetings, we need to pray that God would bind the god of this age and his blinding work
Suppose that we have an uncovered lens and the proper film, that is, the understanding of the mind and a pure heart
We are like a camera, so we must learn how to handle this camera correctly to take in God and Christ as the picture
Regrettably, many Christians do not know that they are 'cameras'; they do not know how to handle their mind and their heart
Whenever the divine light shines on us, the image of Christ comes into us, and we have a picture of Christ within us
We were made as vessels to contain God in our many parts, so we have to know all these parts, not just the mind and the heart
For the phrase within them, both the King James Version and the American Standard Version render it as 'in their inward parts'
Psalm 51:6 says, 'Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me'
In order to know Christ and enter into Him as our rest and good land, we have to discern our spirit from the soul
Thessalonians 5:23 speaks of our whole being, telling us that we are tripartite-spirit, soul, and body-but it says nothing about the heart
We must see what the heart is, what it is composed of, and how we can locate it with respect to the inward parts and the hidden part
If we put all these verses together, we can realize that there are many different inward parts within the many outward parts of the body
According to Jeremiah 31 and Hebrews 8, the mind is one of the inward parts, and as we shall see, the mind is a part of the soul
In summary, we have the outward part of the body, the inward parts of the soul, and the spirit as the hidden part
By these verses we can be clear that the mind as the organ to know, to consider, and to remember is a part of the soul
Since we must make a decision to bind our soul to vow to the Lord, this also proves that the will must be a part of the soul
With God there are three persons, with man there are three parts, and with the soul there are also three inward parts
The width of a standing board, for example, was one and a half cubits; two boards in a pair were a whole measurement of three cubits
It is easy to understand what the function of the conscience is, which is to know right and wrong and to condemn or justify before God
In our spirit there is such a part that many times has a direct sense, regardless of the reason, circumstance, background, or environment
We call this organ, or this function, the intuition of the spirit, with a direct sense and direct knowledge from God
On the one hand, the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit, and on the other hand, our conscience bears witness with the Holy Spirit
To pray is to fellowship with God, so to pray in the spirit means that fellowship with the Lord is a matter in our spirit
To know something in the soul is to know by reason and circumstances, but our human spirit can discern and know things apart from any reason
Mark 2:8 says that Jesus knew fully in His spirit what the scribes were reasoning, and 8:12 says that He groaned deeply in His spirit
These verses are adequate to prove that within our spirit there is a function to realize discern and perceive things to have a direct sense
Rather, the heart is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, the conscience
These three passages are adequate and very strong to prove that the mind, which is the organ of thought, is a part of the heart
The intentions, like the purposes, are something of the will, but here it says that they are something of the heart
The heart comes first, because it is composed of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, the conscience
While we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but at the time we repented, our heart turned back to the Lord
We must also exercise our heart to believe in the Lord for all our environment and circumstances, for all the things happening to us
By this point we will realize how wrong we are, how many mistakes we have made, and how much filthiness we have to deal with
We will need to confess to have the cleansing, the sprinkling of the blood, that we may be sprinkled from an evil conscience
Just as we could not see without eyes, hear without ears, or think without a mind, we could not love without our heart
They know the function of the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth, but they simply do not know the function of the heart
Even the first experience of our Christian life, our salvation, is a matter of the heart loving the Lord Jesus
The Bible tells us that originally we were dead, and at the time we received the Lord Jesus, we were made alive
At the time we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the all-inclusive, wonderful Holy Spirit came into our spirit
Thousands and even millions of people throughout history who were dead were immediately made alive in their spirit
According to Ezekiel 36:26, at the time we were saved, God not only renewed our heart but also renewed our spirit
Romans 8:11 says that His Spirit dwells in us, and verse 16 proves that this Spirit dwells in our human spirit
1 Corinthians 6:17 clearly tells us that from this time onward this wonderful spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit
The purpose of our spirit is to contact the Lord, to receive the Lord, to worship God, and to fellowship with the divine Person
If we want to receive voices, we have to exercise our ears, and if we are going to receive scenery and colors, we have to exercise our eyes
No doubt, only one organ was created by God for the purpose of receiving and contacting Him; that is our spirit
We have to love the Lord then we will take Him touch Him contact Him commune with Him fellowship with Him and receive Him in our spirit
Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we are being transformed, but by that verse alone we are not clear what part is being transformed
As we have seen, the purpose of the heart is to love the Lord, and the purpose of the spirit is to receive and to contact the Lord
We love Him with our heart, we receive and contact Him with our spirit, and we reflect and express Him with our transformed soul
According to human understanding these six thingsbehavior the form of godliness service knowledge gifts and powerare very close to life
We need to see the difference between life and behavior and between the growth of life and the improvement of behavior
Life is simply Christ, whereas behavior is what we do, how we act, how we behave ourselves, and what kind of conduct we have
At that time, however, Adam did not have the divine life, because life is Christ, and Adam did not have Christ
After the fall, therefore, just as the human race could do evil, it could also do good, because both good and evil are of the same category
How can we differentiate the love, humility, and patience that are out of ourselves from that which is the spreading of Christ?
Again someone may have humility toward a brother, but this humility has no sense, no sweetness, no sweet odor of Christ
If someone advises us to have a change and be more humble, it seems that this is good advice given by love and in love
Spontaneously we will have a change by the spreading of Christ as life to meet the need of humility among the brothers
They taught that we should wash one another's feet to show that we love each other, and sometimes they practiced this
Apart from Christ as life, we can have only the improvement of behavior, but we cannot have the growth of life
In today's Christianity we can easily see many forms of godliness, especially when we come into a church 'service'
Many think that in order to show that they are godly, they must pick up their Bible on the Lord's Day morning and walk in a certain way
He anticipated that so before he arrived he disappeared from the public view and went to a little park to play on a seesaw with the children
In doing this he was trying to break their natural concept of godliness and to help them to realize what real godliness is
We may have no intention of being like God, of having godliness, but we are one with the Lord and always filled with Him
Our inner man is strengthened by Him, He makes His home in all the parts of our being, and we are even filled unto all the fullness of God
Suppose that we all live by Christ in such a way that we are filled with the riches of Christ unto the fullness of God
A small brother may think that he should imitate Paul in order to have the likeness of God, but this is to have merely the form of godliness
Comparatively speaking, many people have too much knowledge, although they know too little of what they need to know
As we have clearly seen, the growth of life is the increase and expanding of Christ, not the increase of knowledge
The apostle Paul exhorted them to exercise not their soul but their spirit not to learn more knowledge but to contact the Lord more and more
The growth of life is different from the manifestation of the miraculous, supernatural gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14
It is a real tragedy in today's Christianity that many Christians consider the miraculous gifts the same as life
For the growth of life there is the need of the work of the cross, but for power in itself there is not such a need
There is no other way but to always open ourselves to the Lord and contact Him, not only once a day but all the time, daily, every day
Simply pay attention to one thing, that is, to Christ, to open ourselves to Him, contact Him, breathe Him in, feed on Him, and drink of Him
To be sure, the more we feed on Christ and breathe Him in, the more we will be burned and will be burning; we will have the real zeal within
We will also have the real knowledge, not the knowledge in the soul but the real knowledge of Christ in the spirit
The more we feed on the Lord, the more we take Him in, and the more we grow in Him, the more our function in life will come into being
In order to know and experience the inner life more and more, we need to learn to differentiate all these things
We need to experience the things of life, and then we need to learn how to present them to others in a brief, clear, and impressive way
God's intention is to put Himself into us as the eternal life, the uncreated life, to fulfill His eternal purpose
John 1 tells us that Christ as the expression of God was incarnated in order that we may receive God as our life
In our birth from our parents we received the human life, but now we are born of God to receive the divine life, which is God Himself
Today's theology tells people that because we are fallen, our life has became rotten; therefore, we need a better life
In a sense this is right, but we should realize that even if man had never become fallen, he would still need to be born again
What happens, though, is not only a recovering but a regenerating, a life-imparting, because the Holy Spirit brings Christ Himself into us
The breath of life that God breathed into man in Genesis 2:7 was only a part of God's creation, for the purpose that man could live
Some Christian teachers have made a serious mistake, teaching that at the time of creation God put Himself into man
John 3:36, 5:24, 6:47, and 1 John 5:11 and 12 also show us that by regeneration we receive the eternal life, which is God Himself
Verse 25 speaks of cleansing on the negative side, and verse 26 tells us that our old heart and deadened spirit have been renewed
The Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit of Christ today is the Spirit of life within us
There is no adequate equivalent in English for the Greek word for Comforter, so we have borrowed the Greek word as Paraclete
If you need water, he gives you water, and if you need medicine, he gives you medicine, somewhat like a nurse does
In Christianity today too many people pay attention to learning all kinds of doctrines but not the teachings concerning life
As the seal the Spirit marks us as God's inheritance, God's property, and as the pledge He is the guarantee that God is our inheritance
There are many other aspects of the Spirit, such as the Spirit of sonship, the Spirit of holiness, and the Spirit of wisdom
Many Christians today think that they know many things, and they do, but the one thing they do not know is life
If you put a Christian to the test and ask him or her to speak something about life, you will see where Christians today are
The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and within the divine life is the divine nature
In this all-inclusive Spirit we even have the human nature of Christ and the effectiveness and killing power of Christ's death
As children of God, we have God within us as life, but as the new creation, we have God within us as our essence, element, and substance
The body was not dead the soul was not dead and neither was our heart dead but these two portions of the Word say clearly that we were dead
Since we have a spirit, a soul, and a body, it must be that before the time of our regeneration we were dead in our spirit
According to the same verses mentioned above in Ephesians and Colossians, at the time of regeneration our spirit was made alive
Not only is the spirit itself with its three parts revived, but it now has the Spirit of God, even Christ Himself, in it
Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit, and 2 Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit
Rather, there are verses in the four Gospels in which the Lord Himself tells us to deny the soul, to put the soul on the cross
To be sure, there is a soul and there is a function for the soul, but we have to realize that the spirit comes first
In the Bible these two words are never used interchangeably, just as the eyes and the ears are very close to each other but are different
Even after we are saved and our spirit is made alive and renewed, we still are not used to exercising the spirit
Today the heavenly 'electricity' has been installed in our spirit, but we are not used to exercising this part
As Christians, the regenerated ones, whenever we are going to do something, we have to learn the lesson to deny the soul and the self
Matthew 16:26 says, 'For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life'?
Whereas Luke 9:25 says, 'For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself'?
After a few hours something sprang up from deep within and became clear to me, sometimes right away but sometimes gradually, bit by bit
Before this time the brother may have had many reasons ready in his mind and emotion with which to reason with his wife
The more he considers his reasons, the stronger he becomes, and he finally makes the decision to go to his wife in that way
Since we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to participate in the meetings, many have truly been convinced
After a certain period of practice and exercise, our spirit will be sensitive, and we will be used to the sensitivity of the spirit
If we all will learn the lesson how to deny the soul and let something spring up from within the spirit, our meetings will be revolutionized
The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to deny the negative thing; then the positive thing will spring up
Similarly, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
It is by death that we know the flesh, and in the same principle it is by life, peace, and release that we know the spirit
If we come to someone and see the expression of death, this shows that his life is gone; then we know that this is a dead person
In the same way, the way to know the spirit is by its expressions, which are revealed in the above two verses: life, peace, and freedom
