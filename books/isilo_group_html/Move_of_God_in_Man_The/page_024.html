Caring for the Things of God<br>at the Age of Twelve</H2><P>He also cared for the things of God at the age of twelve (Luke 2:42, 46-47, 49). The age of twelve is the age of a boy's full growth. The boy Jesus was caring for the interest of God when He was twelve years old.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Maturity</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Begin His Ministry for God<br>at the Age of Thirty</H2><P>In His maturity as a man at the age of thirty, He began His ministry for God (Luke 3:23). Thirty years of age is the full age for God's service (Num. 4:3, 35, 39-40, 43-44, 47-48). In the Old Testament a man entered into an apprenticeship for the priesthood at the age of twenty-five. He learned for five years and became mature at the age of thirty. The Lord Jesus became mature at the age of thirty to carry out His earthly ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be a Man of Sorrows</H2><P>From the time that He became a minister of God, He also became a man of sorrows, suffering the despising, rejection, and persecution of man (Isa. 53:3; Matt. 13:55-57; Luke 4:28-30; Matt. 26:4, 16). Throughout His whole life, He was suffering, but especially in the last three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Be Tempted by the Devil</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Led by the Spirit</H2><P>After He became thirty years old, He was tempted by the devil, and this temptation was under the leading of the Spirit of God (Matt. 4:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Defeating the Devil and<br>Being Ministered to by the Angels</H2><P>In that temptation He defeated the devil, and after that temptation He was ministered to by the angels (Matt. 4:11).</P><P>We can see the move of God in man as He passed through human living in the stages of human life. He was a real man in babyhood, in boyhood, and in His maturity as He ministered for God. His human living was a very particular living. It was the living of God in His move within man and through man. His living was God's living in a man, which should be our living today. The Christian living should be a living in which God lives a human life in His children.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Move of God in Man &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
