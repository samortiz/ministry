   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was the apostles who appointed the elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But here Paul, the leading one who did the appointing, says that the Holy Spirit did it.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This teaching is also the source of the Episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Notice that Paul speaks of the "saints with the overseers and deacons.''</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the only place in the New Testament where such an expression is found.</S>
