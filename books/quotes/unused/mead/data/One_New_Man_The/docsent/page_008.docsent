   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Establishment of the Roman Empire</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first major event of history in the last two thousand years was the founding and establishment of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Roman Empire was established by Caesar Augustus around 31 B.C., a little over thirty years before Christ was born.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This came into being for the spreading, the propagation, of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Christ was born, the Roman Empire was founded to prepare the way for the gospel to be spread to all the peoples under heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the establishment of the Roman Empire, the peoples around the Mediterranean were fully divided.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was the Roman Empire that made the Greek language the international language of all the peoples around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the time came that the gospel should be preached, all the peoples around the Mediterranean were prepared to understand one language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One language, Greek, was sufficient for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wherever the apostles went, there was no problem of language because the Roman Empire had done this wonderful thing for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Apostle Paul could freely visit other countries because the Roman Empire had unified all the different nations around the Mediterranean under one empire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This made it so convenient for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One citizenship was good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Acts 22, when Paul was about to be beaten, he appealed on the grounds of his Roman citizenship v. 25 . The Roman Empire also built highways throughout Europe and Asia-Minor, from Spain to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only was there the traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, but also there were the highways built on the land by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also was so convenient for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the Roman Empire was strong to keep a peaceful order among all the peoples around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Roman Empire accomplished these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They made Greek the international language, they unified all the nations into one empire, they built highways, and they kept a very peaceful order for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Roman Empire was founded only about thirty years before Christ, and about thirty years after Christ's birth, the gospel was accomplished and was ready to be preached.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By that time the language was ready, the empire was unified, the highways were built, and the peaceful order was maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything was in favor of the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the first major thing that happened in these last two thousand years for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within less than fifty years the gospel was preached to all the nations under the heaven around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Reformation and the Discovery of the New World Liberating Man's Mentality</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the church was brought forth, it began to decline and degrade, eventually reaching the dark ages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time Martin Luther was raised up to recover the truth concerning justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was sovereign of God that also around that time Columbus discovered America.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reformation of the church and the discovery of the new land liberated man's mentality which had been imprisoned under Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since that time also science was improved and industry was increased.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through science and industry "isms" such as capitalism, socialism, and, eventually due to overproduction, imperialism came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these isms are wrong things, but we must realize that they were sovereignly used by God to open the doors of the divided and closed people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the second major item of history the liberation of the imprisoned mentality under Catholicism through the Reformation under Martin Luther and the discovery of the new world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>History tells us that these events brought in a great change in man's thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Britain's Defeat of Spain</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third great item of history was the defeat of Spain by Britain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Columbus's discovery of the new land, Spain became the dominant power of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason Central America and South America are Spanish speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The so-called Latin Americas are actually the Spanish Americas.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since Spain was fully for Catholicism, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Merely by a short battle on the sea, Spain was defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that time on, Britain became the major power over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was said that the sun never set on the British Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Britain became such a wide-spread power over the world, and this was used by God to spread His gospel, not by Catholicism, but by the Protestant missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was through this third major item of history that the gospel was brought to every corner of all the continents, especially to Asia, Africa, and Australasia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Catholicism is not so prevailing on these continents.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was God's sovereign doing to bring the gospel to all the nations.</S>
