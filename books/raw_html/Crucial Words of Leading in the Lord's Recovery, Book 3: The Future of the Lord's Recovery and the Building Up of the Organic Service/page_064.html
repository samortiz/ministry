	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES IN CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning some of the spiritual principles in the church service. In the preceding messages we fellowshipped concerning the arrangements for the work and the way the full-time serving ones should lead the small groups and how they should advance the gospel in the homes, on the campus, and with the children. The full-time serving ones must also advance the gospel in the community through the brothers and sisters at all levels of society.</p>
<p>We do not have time to fellowship concerning the details of these points. These will be left for every locality to decide as they begin working in these areas. We must pray much, have thorough fellowship with one another, and observe the situation. Then we can study the practical steps that should be taken. The steps that we fellowship in this meeting are only general principles. For example, a person who wants to be healthy must eat at least three meals per day. However, he still should study and decide whether he should eat Chinese or American food, whether to eat steamed buns or rice, and whether to use a fork and knife or chopsticks. He does not need special guidance with respect to these details.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE NEEDING TO BE ORGANIC<br />
NOT ORGANIZATIONAL</h2>
<p>We are burdened concerning the purpose of our gatherings. We must realize that we are in the Lord and that we are brothers and sisters. Such relationships are not simple. The saved ones in Christian groups are also in the Lord and are brothers and sisters, but we are not meeting with them. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to be gathered together so that we may maintain a corporate testimony. We do not agree with the Catholic Church, because the testimony of Catholicism is an error. We also do not agree with the groups in Christianity, because they do not have the proper testimony.</p>
<p>Still, we need to ask concerning the testimony we should maintain. According to the ways of human society, organization is necessary in order to accomplish anything. However, we cannot rely on organization. But if we reject organization, how should we proceed in the work? Some saints may respond that we should rely on the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers. While it is scriptural for elders to administrate the church, we cannot do this in a way of organization.</p>
<p>The general concept in human society is that a church is managed by a pastor. For example, when a reporter wants to interview someone from a church, he ask`s to see the pastor. Not many Christians know about the administration of the church by the eldership, or presbytery. Presbyterians know the term <em>presbytery,</em> but often they do not understand what it means.</p>
<p>When I was young, I studied in an English junior college that was run by the American Presbyterian Church. I was a student there, but I did not know who the elders were. I only knew the names of a few pastors. One of the pastors was the uncle of one of the brothers among us. He was famous in the Presbyterian Church, and he was an eloquent and skillful preacher. I am saying this to show that we did not know what an elder was, but we knew what a pastor was.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised up His recovery in China, the first thing we emphasized was the recovery of the practices in the Scriptures. One day we saw that in the Bible the administration and leading of the church are carried out by the elders. So we appointed elders. As the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in His recovery in China became stronger, the practice of having elders administrate the church was received by other Christian groups. The term <em>elder</em> was commonly used among us, and we became famous for using this term. Today this term has traveled to America. Even Chinese newspapers in America speak of interviewing elders rather than pastors.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we have observed that even among us, most brothers and sisters rely on the elders as if they were pastors. Therefore, when we ask how to advance the work, everyone thinks that we must rely on the elders. We have given ourselves to serve full time, but who directs us in our service to the Lord? To say that the Lord directs us is certainly correct and spiritual, but we must ask what this means. You may say that it means to follow the sense of life, to follow the anointing. We cannot dispute with such an answer, because it is definitely a teaching according to the Bible.</p>
<p>Suppose a sister follows her so-called sense of life, or the anointing of the Spirit, and goes to serve in Kaohsiung. Although the church in Kaohsiung may acknowledge her burden and allow her to serve on the campus, they may feel that there was no fellowship. They may feel that she is able to carry out a spiritual function, but that she is unable to carry out any practical service. This shows that when we serve, we cannot be alone. It does not matter how much of a burden a person has, he cannot accomplish anything alone or independently. On the one hand, we have the sense of life, the anointing, and the operating of the Spirit. On the other hand, we are extremely limited in what we can do in the service and must rely on and enjoy the service of other saints. We cannot be individualistic. We cannot exist without the Body life. In other words, if we want to serve the Lord, we must have the Body life.</p>
<p>Organization is in human society as well as in Catholicism and Christianity. But the church revealed in the Bible is not an organization but an organism. Hence, we must ask ourselves whether the testimony of our service is that of an organization or of an organism. If the testimony of our service is an organism, it is the Body. A group is an organization, but a body is an organism. We are not an organization; we are the Body. All the members of the human body are organic parts. Many people wear false teeth, which are not organic members of their body. False teeth are an organization. The difference is that false teeth do not have the life of the body. Only the members with the life of the body can be part of the body. Things without the life of the body are an organization, even if they are within the body.</p>
<p>The elders should ask themselves whether they are a part of an organism or an organization inside the organism. In the example of the sister in Kaohsiung, she must ask herself whether her service is an organic function or an organization within an organism. We must all ask ourselves this question, and we must answer it with much consideration. Then we will realize that whether we are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-time serving one, our motives and element are mainly organizational, not organic. This is the focus of this message.</p>
