<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is composed of a series of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 23 through 28, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE VINE AND THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14; 15:1, 4-5, 7, 26; 6:63; 14:17-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE VINE AND THE HUSBANDMAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Five Major Items That Have<br />
an Outward Aspect and an Inward Aspect</h2>
<p>Although as individual human beings we seem small and insignificant, we are actually quite meaningful. Our physical body is merely the outward aspect of our being. Within our body is something altogether abstract and mysterious. By looking at a person&rsquo;s face, especially at his eyes, we can see that there is something within the person, yet we cannot fully explain what it is. We cannot see what is within us, but we know that there surely is something within us. We may have learned from the Bible that we have a spirit, a soul, a heart, a conscience, a mind, an emotion, and a will, but these inward, invisible organs are quite mysterious. Although we cannot explain them, we know that they are real. If we had only a physical body and lacked these inward organs, we would be empty and meaningless. Human beings are meaningful not in the outward things but in the inward things.</p>
<p>The universe, which contains the heavens, the earth, and millions of created things, may be likened to our physical body. All the solar systems and galaxies are merely the outward structure of the universe, just as the body is the physical structure of a human being. There is something within the physical structure of the universe. If there were nothing within the universe, it would be meaningless. The meaning of the universe is not in all the visible things but in something that is invisible and physically intangible.</p>
<p>The history of humankind also has an outward aspect and an inward aspect. Within the outward structure of human history there is a history of something inward.</p>
<p>The church is another major item that has an outward structure and also something within. The outward aspect is seen; the inward is unseen. We can see the church outwardly, but within the church is Christ, who is a mystery (Col. 2:2). No one can fully explain Christ. Although I have been a Christian for over half a century, I have never seen Christ. Some may say that I am crazy to believe in Christ despite having never seen Him. I would answer, &ldquo;Yes, I have been crazy for over fifty years, I am still crazy, and I hope to be more crazy.&rdquo; Although the disciples saw Christ physically, they did not see Him inwardly. Paul said, &ldquo;We have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:16b). Now we know Christ according to the Spirit, but the Spirit also is quite mysterious and intangible in a physical sense. Thus, the church is another item having an outward aspect and an inward aspect.</p>
<p>A fifth item that has both an outward aspect and an inward aspect is the Bible. All other printed materials in human history have only an outward aspect. No other writing has an inward aspect. It is not that the outward aspect is the cover and the inward aspect is the words inside. We may know, according to John 6:63, that the inward aspect of the word of the Bible is spirit and life, but spirit and life are still quite mysterious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Vine and the Husbandman Being<br />
the Meaning of These Five Major Items</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John, which is a representative book of the sixty-six books in the Bible, is a book of mysteries, containing mysteries upon mysteries and mysteries within mysteries. Regardless of how intelligent or educated we are, we will have difficulty explaining certain terms and expressions in John. For instance, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; It is difficult to define who or what the Word and God are in this verse. Verse 4 goes on to say, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; <em>Life</em> and <em>light</em> also are terms that are difficult to define. Then verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Because we are familiar with the Bible, we may take these words for granted, thinking that we understand them, but we may have difficulty explaining what it means for the Word to become flesh or what the words <em>grace</em> and <em>reality</em> mean. In the first fourteen verses of chapter 1 alone we have found seven mysterious terms and expressions.</p>
<p>In John 15:1 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; <em>Husbandman</em> in Greek means &ldquo;cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer.&rdquo; It is quite easy to understand what a vine is and what a farmer is. It seems that chapter 15 is not as mysterious as chapter 1. However, we need to see that these simple items are quite profound.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is the true vine and the Father is the husbandman is the meaning of every human being, of the universe, of all human history, of the church, and of the entire Bible. The story of human beings, the universe, human history, the church, and the Bible is simply the story of this vine and this husbandman. If we do not see the vine and the husbandman, we cannot understand the meaning of the universe. A history professor may have an extensive knowledge of history, but this knowledge means nothing if he does not know the vine and the husbandman, for the true meaning of human history is the vine and the husbandman. If we do not know the vine and the husbandman, we surely do not know the church. Regardless of what else we know of the Bible, if we do not know the vine and the husbandman, we do not know the Bible. The meaning of the Bible is embodied in the vine and the husbandman. If we do not know the vine and the husbandman, we do not know ourselves; we do not know what we are or what the meaning of our human life is. Most people do not know the meaning of their life. They know only that they need to eat, sleep, drink, breathe, have a home, find a spouse, beget children, and work to make a living. We may think that because we are a Christian, we know the meaning of our life. However, even though we may have been a Christian for many years, we do not know what it means to be a Christian if we do not know the vine and the husbandman in John 15.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST, THE VINE, BEING GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Christ is the true vine, and God the Father as the husbandman cultivates this vine. In other words, God grows the vine. If we could ask God what He is doing every day in the universe, He would say that He is growing the vine. The Pentecostals may expect God to say that He is healing people. The Bible scholars and seminarians may think that God is teaching people the Bible. The missionaries may believe that God&rsquo;s burden is to mercifully save fallen sinners. However, we know that today God is growing the vine. Christ is the true vine; therefore, God is growing Christ. <em>Growing Christ</em> may be an unfamiliar expression not only to unbelievers but even to most Christians, including many pastors. Nevertheless, just as certain farmers grow cotton, God grows Christ; He farms Christ. I once met some cotton farmers in Texas. There was nothing but cotton on their mind, in their talk, and even in their dreams. Cotton was their lifeline, their economy. In like manner, Christ is God&rsquo;s economy. God is doing nothing in the universe other than growing Christ. God grows Christ all the time. Furthermore, God does not grow Christ alone. We are branches of Christ, and as His branches, we also grow Christ. We help the husbandman to grow Christ.</p>
<p>The vine is God&rsquo;s economy. We need to see a vision of what God is doing today. Briefly, God is growing Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s economy. This is a great vision. Since the day I saw that Christ is God&rsquo;s economy, this vision has rendered much help to me. Christ, who is God&rsquo;s economy, is the Word, and the Word is God Himself (1:1). Thus, God&rsquo;s economy is God Himself. Although we have already seen that God the Father is the husbandman and that Christ as the vine is His economy, now we see that this economy is also God Himself. God the Father has an economy, and this economy is the Word and is God. Moreover, this economy is altogether a matter of life, light, grace, and reality (vv. 4, 14). God&rsquo;s economy is full of the Word, God, life, light, grace, and reality.</p>
<p>Life is simple. We should not complicate matters of life. Although medical doctors have studied the physical life for centuries, their knowledge of life is still very limited. To fully understand life may be impossible, but to experience life is simple. We do not need to study in medical school to know how to experience life. Even a newborn baby experiences life. Life itself is complex, but in our experience life is simple.</p>
<p>Christianity and even some local churches are full of works and activities. However, we need to see that God&rsquo;s economy is not a work or a movement, such as evangelization. God&rsquo;s economy is simply the Word, God, life, light, grace, and reality. The Gospel of John reveals God&rsquo;s economy in this light by showing that God the Father as the husbandman grows Christ as the vine and that Christ is the Word, God, life, light, grace, and reality. If we see only a glimpse of this picture, we will have a marvelous view of what God is doing today. God is growing Christ as the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE BRANCHES<br />
GROWING THE VINE IN DIFFERENT WAYS</h2>
<p>Unlike a pine tree, which is tall and has relatively short branches, a vine does not shoot up but spreads outward through its branches. Christ today is spreading through us as His branches. God as the husbandman grows Christ, and we as the branches also grow Christ. However, the Father&rsquo;s growing of Christ is different from our growing of Christ.</p>
<p>The Father grows Christ by cultivating, supplying, and being the source of the vine. God the Father supplies the vine by being the soil, the sunshine, the air, and the water that the vine needs. Because God the Father is the source of supply for Christ as the vine, Christ is the very embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). Thus, the vine and the husbandman are one. The husbandman cannot be separated from the vine, nor can the vine be separated from the husbandman. The Gospel of John says the Father and the Son are one (10:30; 17:21). The Father as the husbandman with the supply is fully embodied in the Son as the vine.</p>
<p>The Father grows the vine by supplying the vine and by being embodied in the vine. The believers grow the vine in a different way. We do not supply the vine, nor are we embodied in the vine. Rather, the vine is embodied in us, the branches. Moreover, the branches do not supply the vine, but the vine supplies the branches. The Father as the source grows the vine by growing into the vine, and we as the branches grow the vine by expressing the vine. The Father is embodied in the vine, and the vine is embodied in us. The vine is the embodiment of the Father, and we the branches are the embodiment of the vine. The branches do nothing but branch out the vine. The branching out of the vine is the growth of the vine. The vine grows through the branches, and the branches grow the vine by spreading the vine.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING CHRIST, GROWING CHRIST,<br />
AND PRODUCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The picture of the vine and the husbandman shows us what God is doing in this universe and what we need to do. As branches in the vine, we simply need to grow Christ by expressing Him. In a sense, the branches of a vine do nothing; they have no work or activities. The branches simply live the vine. The branches do not merely live out the vine or live by the vine; they actually live the vine. Paul said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21a). Day by day we need to live Christ. When we are enlightened to see that our unique obligation on the earth today is to live Christ, we will be immediately exposed. If we consider our actual situation in this light, we will confess that we are not truly living Christ. Although we are busy doing many things, we may not be living Christ. As branches in the vine, our main responsibility is to live the vine, to live Christ. In order to see who we are and what we should be doing on the earth today, we do not need to study doctrines. We need only to look at the picture of the vine to see that we are branches in Christ and that we should simply live Christ.</p>
<p>We do not need to wonder how to live Christ. Matters of life are not mainly matters of method. A baby enjoys life, but he does not ask how. A baby breathes, sleeps, and cries without ever asking his parents how to do these things. In matters related to life there is no method; there is simply living. If we are alive, we simply live, though we may not have been taught how. Knowledge may actually frustrate life. If a baby simply lives for some time, he will inevitably breathe, sleep, and cry. No one was ever taught how to shed tears or how to stop shedding tears, because these are matters of life. If we feel the need to ask how to live Christ, this may indicate that we are not living Christ. If we are truly living Christ, we will not ask how&mdash;we will simply live Christ. Life is very practical yet very mysterious; it is simple, yet no one can explain it. Life simply lives.</p>
<p>As believers, we are not only the disciples of Christ; we also are the branches of Christ. Since we are branches, our main need is not to learn many things. We simply need to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. When I was young, my family lived near a vineyard. I saw that the vine grows through the branches and that the branches live the vine, grow the vine, and eventually produce the vine. Their producing of the vine is fruit-bearing. The burden in this chapter is our living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ.</p>
<p>Although the words in this chapter are simple, through them we need to see a vision. In my youth in Christianity I heard that the Lord is the vine and that we are His branches. However, for many years I did not see the vision. I saw a little, but not as much as I have seen recently. We need a vision in order to see that in the entire universe God is doing only one thing&mdash;He is growing Christ. God grows Christ by being the source of supply that is embodied in Christ. Christ as the embodiment of God is the economy of God. Furthermore, we are the branches of this economy, branching out God&rsquo;s economy by living, growing, and producing Christ. Seeing this vision will change our life. We will realize that God predestinated us to be branching factors of His economy. The Christian life is simply to live, grow, and produce Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT BEING THE MEANS<br />
BY WHICH WE ABIDE IN THE VINE</h2>
<p>What we have seen of the vine thus far may be somewhat abstract, but two further items mentioned in John 15 make this matter practical and experiential. The first item is the Lord&rsquo;s word. In verse 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; Then in verse 7 He said, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you...&rdquo; It seems that the Lord was saying, &ldquo;In order for Me to abide in you, you must have My word. When My word abides in you, I am abiding in you. I am mysterious, but My word is tangible. I am abstract, but My word is concrete. I am untouchable, but My word is receivable. You can touch My word and receive My word. When you receive My word, you receive Me, for My word is My embodiment.&rdquo; Then in John 15:26 the Lord said, &ldquo;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&rdquo; Here it seems that the Lord was saying, &ldquo;The Spirit will transmit what I am into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way for us to abide in the Lord as branches in the vine is to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and touch the Spirit. All Christians have two great inheritances from God&mdash;the word in the Bible and the Spirit. We all have the Bible without and the Spirit within. These are the two means by which we abide in the vine. The proper receiving of the word and the proper touching of the Spirit are the abiding in the vine. First, we all need to see a vision of the vine. Second, we all need to receive the word and touch the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Reading the Bible Legally Every Day</h2>
<p>Many believers do not touch and receive the word regularly. We need to daily read and pray-read the Bible. We need to daily touch and receive a portion of the Bible regularly and even legally. Something that is regular may not be binding, but whatever is legal is binding. Some believers may claim that we should not be legal in anything. They may quote Romans 6:14b, which says, &ldquo;You are not under the law but under grace.&rdquo; Yes, we are not under the old law, but we need to realize that we are under a new law. In John 13:34 the Lord said, &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.&rdquo; The New Testament has far more than ten commandments. First Thessalonians 5:17 says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo; This is a commandment. Philippians 4:4 says, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always.&rdquo; This is another commandment. Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Here are two more commandments. In 1 Corinthians 9:21 Paul said, &ldquo;I am not without law to God but within law to Christ.&rdquo; Moreover, Hebrews 8:10b says, &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them.&rdquo; Those who say that they are under grace alone and have no law may be misusing grace.</p>
<p>We need to be legal in coming to the Word daily. Some may ask where a law is in the New Testament that we must read the Bible legally. This law is found in Matthew 4:4, where the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The law in this verse is that just as we eat physical food every day, so we must receive the word of God every day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading the Bible Being a Life Necessity</h2>
<p>Some saints may think that we do not need to be legal in our Bible reading and that we can read the Bible only when the Spirit inspires us. Thinking this way is equivalent to thinking that we do not need to be legal in eating physical food every day and that we can eat only when we are inspired. No healthy person eats only when he is inspired. Reading the Bible is no different from eating physical food, for both are life necessities.</p>
<p>Reading the Word is our spiritual eating, praying is our spiritual drinking, and praying unceasingly is our spiritual breathing. These are all life necessities, for spiritually we live by them, just as physically we live by eating, drinking, and breathing. We do not depend on inspiration to take care of our life necessities. Just as we do not wait for inspiration to eat physically, neither should we wait for inspiration to read the Bible. Because eating the word, drinking the Spirit, and breathing the Spirit are necessities of our spiritual life, we should do each one legally.</p>
<p>Those who have only coffee and a doughnut for breakfast will be unhealthy. However, if we are legal to eat a nutritious breakfast every day, we will be strong and healthy. We need to legalize our breakfast. My wife is very strict with me&mdash;every day she serves me the same kind of nutritious breakfast. My health, my strength, and my energy come mainly from eating such a breakfast each day. We need to eat the word every morning to have a healthy breakfast for our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Being Able to Spend Time<br />
in the Word and in Prayer Each Morning</h2>
<p>Some saints may find it difficult to spend time in the Word each morning because they must go to school or work very early. I sympathize with these saints, but I do not want to see them die spiritually. Regardless of how early we go to school or work, if we set our will, we are all able to spend at least ten minutes to read the Word and five minutes to pray each morning in order to spiritually eat and drink. Eating requires more time than drinking. Practicing this faithfully will cause us to be spiritually healthy. It is possible for everyone to do this. To reduce our sleep by fifteen minutes will not hurt us.</p>
<p>Some saints claim that because they were born with a weak disposition, they should not be bound by any legalities. They support this claim by quoting Romans 7:18, which says, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rdquo; However, verses 15 through 17 show that this word was written about overcoming indwelling sin, not about taking care of daily life necessities. No caring parent would excuse a child from eating breakfast simply because the child was born with a weak disposition. Nor would any employee tell his boss that he cannot come to work early in the morning because he was born with a weak disposition or that he will wait for inspiration to come to work. Life forces us all to find a way to do what we need to do. If we can find time to eat breakfast, and if we can arrive at our workplace on time, we should not despise the Lord by saying that we cannot rise early to spend time in the Word and in prayer every morning. If we see that spending time in the Word is truly a life necessity, we will not excuse ourselves from it.</p>
<p>If we set our will to spend time in the Word every morning, we can do it. Where there is a will, there is a way. Every part of our fallen being is condemned by God, but one part is still useful to God, that is, our will. In Mark 1:15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel.&rdquo; Repenting and believing are two New Testament commandments. We can fulfill these commandments by using our will. To repent is related not only to the conscience but also to the will. To believe in the Lord Jesus also is a matter of being willing. When we decide to believe, we immediately believe. In Acts 2:40 Peter said, &ldquo;Be saved.&rdquo; To be saved also is a commandment. It is God who saves us, but we first must be willing to be saved. God is merciful, but He waits for our willingness. No one is too weak in his will to be saved. We should not think that we are weak and dying. We need to see that God has given us a strong and living will (2 Tim. 1:7). Therefore, we need to set our will and pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. From tomorrow I will spend ten minutes to eat Your word and five minutes to drink the Spirit every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Daily Reading and Pray-reading<br />
Causing Growth in Life</h2>
<p>If we spend only ten minutes to read and pray over a few verses and five minutes to pray each morning, we will have a nourishing and satisfying spiritual breakfast. We can pray-read the Word to eat the riches of the Lord, and we can even mingle our pray-reading and our prayer together to have a good breakfast. If we practice this, within one month we will see a difference in our life. Many saints have testified that this small practice changed their life. If possible, at lunchtime or in the evening we can spend some time to read a few chapters of the Bible. If we read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament each day, we will finish reading the whole Bible in less than a year. If we continue doing this for several years, we will experience much growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading Consecutively</h2>
<p>In both our pray-reading in the morning and our reading of the Bible later in the day, we need to read consecutively. We should not read the Bible according to our preference or randomly. In reading the Old Testament, we should begin from Genesis 1 and continue until we finish Malachi. Likewise, we should read the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation. For our morning time of reading and pray-reading, we need to look to the Lord, praying, &ldquo;Lord, which book do You intend for me to enter into at the present time?&rdquo; We should pray-read from the first verse to the last verse of whichever book the Lord chooses, taking a few verses each morning. In this way we will receive much nourishment. We need to make a vow to the Lord that we will spend time in the Word every morning. If we keep this vow, the Lord will bless us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTIONS AND CONSTITUENTS<br />
OF THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Cor. 1:18; Phil. 2:16; Eph. 5:26; Col. 3:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Bible Being God&rsquo;s Breath</h2>
<p>The Bible is extraordinary among all other books. The word <em>Bible</em> means &ldquo;the Book.&rdquo; The Bible is called &ldquo;the Book&rdquo; because it is the greatest book. The Bible is extraordinary because it is entirely God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). In other words, the whole Bible is simply God&rsquo;s breath. The Bible was not written according to the human mentality or human logic; rather, every sentence and every word of the Bible was breathed out from God.</p>
<p>The Bible is the divine revelation; however, the basic element of the Bible is not the divine revelation but the divine breath. The divine breath is the nature and element of the divine revelation. Therefore, whenever we come to the Bible, we enter into God&rsquo;s breath and even God&rsquo;s breathing. This is not merely a theory; it has been experienced by many believers. When we come to a textbook or a secular magazine, we will never have the sensation of God&rsquo;s presence. However, whenever we come to the Bible, it leads us into the presence of God. As believers, we can all testify that every time we contact the Bible, we are in the presence of God. Whenever we come to the Bible, we immediately have the sensation that we have come into God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>We may sometimes wonder where God&rsquo;s presence is and how we can enter into God&rsquo;s presence. When I was young, I heard that God&rsquo;s presence was in my heart. However, often when we turn to our heart, we do not meet God there but instead find something else. Many times when I turned to my heart, I was troubled by something in my heart. Hence, to turn to our heart is not the best way to meet God. God&rsquo;s presence is always in the Bible. Whenever we come to the Bible, we find God.</p>
<p>That God&rsquo;s presence accompanies the Bible is logical. One&rsquo;s breath is always near one&rsquo;s face. When we come into a person&rsquo;s breath, we come into that person&rsquo;s presence. Because the Bible is God&rsquo;s breath, God&rsquo;s presence always accompanies it, for His presence is always with His breath. God is mysterious, universal, and eternal, but we can find His breath in the Bible, for the Bible is His breath. We need to realize that the Bible we hold is simply God&rsquo;s breath and that where God&rsquo;s breath is, there His presence is. Whenever we come to the Bible, we should have the assurance that we are entering into God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The unique way to receive God&rsquo;s breath is to come to the Bible, for the Bible is His breath. The Bible is not only God&rsquo;s breath but also God&rsquo;s breathing. There is a difference between one&rsquo;s breath and one&rsquo;s breathing. Breath may be objective and in the past, but breathing is subjective and in the present. God is breathing in His word. Therefore, whenever we come to the Bible, we come into God&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading the Word to Be Refreshed and Washed</h2>
<p>Many believers are concerned that after they read a portion of the Bible, they do not remember the verses they have read. As a result, some even doubt whether they truly need to read the Bible. However, because the Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing, it is like the air that we breathe. When we breathe in fresh air, we do not remember the air. We daily need to be refreshed by breathing in God&rsquo;s word. When we rise up each morning, we should come to the word to come into God&rsquo;s fresh and refreshing breathing. We do not need to remember what we read. We need to come to the word simply to receive the breathing.</p>
<p>We do not need to memorize verses in the morning. Rather than exhausting ourselves by trying to memorize, we should simply read and pray-read a few verses. It is unhealthy to exert a great effort while eating or breathing. The best way to eat is to take the food effortlessly. Those who practice deep breathing do it peacefully. When we come to the Bible, we should be at ease because we are coming into the presence of God not to work but to enjoy and be refreshed by His breathing. This is my experience.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that God&rsquo;s word is not only the breath of God but also water (Eph. 5:26). Water is used in the Bible in a positive sense and also in a negative sense. Negatively, water sometimes signifies death (Gen. 1:2; Exo. 14:21; Matt. 3:16; John 2:7). Positively, water sometimes signifies a flowing supply of life (Exo. 17:6; Jer. 2:13a; John 4:14; 19:34; Rev. 22:1). Water also signifies cleansing (Lev. 14:52; John 13:5). Water not only supplies but also washes. Ephesians 5:26 says, &ldquo;That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.&rdquo; There is water in the word that washes us. The word is water that washes us.</p>
<p>In Shanghai a sister once said to Brother Watchman Nee, &ldquo;I read the Bible diligently, but after many times of reading, it seems that nothing remains within me. I forget everything that I read. Since I cannot remember what I read, is it still necessary for me to read?&rdquo; Brother Nee answered her by using the following illustration. In the countryside in China the women wash rice in baskets made of willow branches. These baskets serve as strainers. The women fill the basket of rice with water, and all the water passes through the rice and the basket. Regardless of how much water they add to the basket, eventually not one drop will stay in the basket. The water simply comes and goes, passing through, and no water remains. Brother Nee pointed out that after water passes through the basket many times, both the rice and the basket are washed. Brother Nee said that we are like the basket. We need to allow the water of the word to pass through us again and again. Perhaps nothing of the word will remain, but neither will any dirt remain. If for one week we come to the Word for at least ten minutes each morning and allow the water of the word to pass through our being, we will be made clean. However, if no water of the word comes and goes in our being, after one week we will be quite dirty. Whether or not we come to the Word makes a real difference in our Christian life.</p>
<p>When we come to the Word, we come into God&rsquo;s breathing and are refreshed. When we come to the Word, we are also washed and cleansed as the divine water of the word passes through us again and again. It may seem that we remember nothing and receive no help, but something negative will be washed away from us. We saw in the previous chapter that the word nourishes us (Matt. 4:4). In this chapter we have seen that the word also refreshes and washes us. Whenever we come to the Bible, we are refreshed by coming into God&rsquo;s breathing. When we read through the Word again and again, we receive an inward cleansing. Just as our physical body needs to be washed every morning, so our inner man needs to be washed morning by morning by coming to the Word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Legalities</h2>
<p>Recently, some have criticized my ministry, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee has given many legalities to us. He says that we need to legally come to the Word every morning and legally pray and contact the Lord every day.&rdquo; I admit that I have encouraged the saints to be legal in these matters. If we do not have some legalities, we cannot be normal persons. If we are sloppy and careless, depending on inspiration to wash, eat, or breathe, we may claim that we are liberated, free, and not under any bondage, but we will actually be killing ourselves. The healthiest person is the most legal person. From the moment a man enters the military service, he must do everything according to instructions, which are legalities. Servicemen do not have an inch of freedom. Day and night they are governed by legalities. Without legalities no military force could be formed, built up, or trained. Without certain necessary legalities, it is impossible to have governments, corporations, schools, or even families. The United States is a free and open democratic country, one that receives all kinds of people, but only a normal, proper, legal person would be elected into public office. We should not be loose Christians. The more legalities we have, the more normal we will be, and the more success we will have.</p>
<p>We all need to practice certain legalities. If we would be legal in our physical eating by taking three meals every day at certain times and not eating too much or too little, we will be healthy. If not, we may develop health problems. Likewise, we need to have certain spiritual legalities. Every morning we need to be legal to spend fifteen minutes in the Word to be in God&rsquo;s presence, to breathe Him in, to be refreshed, to be nourished, and to be watered. In this sense, we need to be legal Christians.</p>
<p>Romans 6:14b says, &ldquo;You are not under the law but under grace.&rdquo; The law mentioned in this verse is the old law, the law of the Old Testament. Today we Christians should be under the new law, the law of the New Testament. The new law is more binding than the old law. The old law was objective, written on tablets of stone, but the new law is subjective, written on our hearts (Heb. 10:16). It spreads into all our inward parts, controlling our mind, emotion, and will. The New Testament economy is one that restricts us.</p>
<p>Every kind of life has certain principles, which are laws. Life is not loose; it does not give us liberty. Life restricts. The higher the life, the more it restricts. This principle can be seen even in humanity. Whoever regulates and restricts himself the most is the highest person. The loosest person is the lowest person. This is a fact. If we desire to be a high Christian, we must keep certain legalities. However, we should not be legal toward others but only toward ourselves. We should not allow ourselves to be loose. Rather, we should restrict ourselves by being legal in keeping all the healthy spiritual practices.</p>
<p>I once brought a young American brother to visit the Far East. I sent him from Taiwan to Manila to preach the gospel. The church there treated him well and placed him in the best room in a co-workers&rsquo; home. A few days later I arrived and stayed in the same home. One day the sisters who took care of the home asked me to look in on the other brother&rsquo;s room. I saw a messy room with socks thrown carelessly about. I felt ashamed that I had sent such a brother there to preach the gospel. It was a shame to the gospel. We should not be this kind of Christian.</p>
<p>To be transformed means not only to be changed but also to be regulated. We need to learn to be legal with ourselves. Some may think that I was simply born with a proper, orderly disposition. On the contrary, I was not born this way. However, today I am very legal with myself. In my study I have several book cases containing many reference books and different versions of the Bible. When I am working there each morning according to my schedule, I never need to guess where a certain book is. I can find any book with my eyes closed. Efficiency comes from being legal. When we are young, we need to learn to be legal to build up a good character. We should not become loose with ourselves in anything.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE WORD BEING CHRIST,<br />
HIS DEATH, AND HIS RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>My burden in this chapter is that we would see what the constituents of the Word are. We may know that the contents of the Bible are the sixty-six books from Genesis to Revelation, but we need to see the very constituents of the Word of God. The Bible is constituted with three major items: Christ, who is the living Lord as our life, His death, and His resurrection. These items are the constituents of the Word of God; they are what is contained in the Word of God.</p>
<p>When I was a young person, I studied some ethical writings of Confucius. Later, I heard some Christian missionaries say that what is taught in the writings of Confucius concerning man&rsquo;s character is also taught in the Bible. Therefore, at that time I saw no difference between the writings of Confucius and the Bible. I knew only that both contained ethical teachings. Now I know that the writings of Confucius only correct, regulate, and try to improve man. They do not contain the thought or the element of death and resurrection. However, the Bible, the Word of God, contains both a killing word and a resurrecting word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of the Cross and the Word of Life</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:18 mentions &ldquo;the word of the cross.&rdquo; The word of the cross is the crucifying, killing word. The whole book of the 1 Corinthians is the word of the cross, because at the time it was written, the church in Corinth needed such a killing word. In the church there were confusion, division, fornication, lawsuits, and many dissenting opinions. Because the church in Corinth was full of problems, the saints there needed the crucifying word to kill them. However, in the Bible there is also the word of life. Philippians 2:15-16a says, &ldquo;That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life.&rdquo; As Christians, we are lampstands shining out the word of life. The word of the cross is the killing word. The word of life is the resurrecting word. First Corinthians is a book of the word of the cross, and 2 Corinthians is a book of the word of life. In 1 Corinthians there are mainly crossing out, killing, and crucifying, but in 2 Corinthians there is resurrecting. Second Corinthians 12:9a says, &ldquo;He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you.&rdquo; This is a word in resurrection. The main ingredient of the Bible is Christ. Besides this main ingredient, the Bible also contains Christ&rsquo;s death and His resurrection.</p>
<p>When I was studying at an American Presbyterian college in China, one day the dean of another school spoke to our school. He read to us Philippians 4:8, which says, &ldquo;Finally, brothers, what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; All the students loved this verse. Eventually, I discovered that even many unbelievers appreciated this verse. However, in order to have a life that is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, well spoken of, virtuous, and praiseworthy, we must undergo the killing of the word of the cross and the resurrecting of the word of life. Romans 3:4a says, &ldquo;Let God be true and every man a liar.&rdquo; All men are false; only God is true. Therefore, in order to be true, our false being must be killed, and we need to be resurrected into God. Romans 3:23a says, &ldquo;All have sinned.&rdquo; Only God is righteous; all men are unrighteous. It is impossible for sinful man to be righteous. However, Philippians 4:8 indicates that we need to be righteous. We can never be righteous in ourselves. The only way to become righteous is by being crucified and resurrected through the word of the cross and the word of life. Likewise, it is impossible to be pure in ourselves. We are dirty, defiled, and filthy. We can be pure only by receiving the killing of the word of the cross and the resurrecting of the word of life.</p>
<p>The entire Bible is full of the killing word and the resurrecting word. In our daily reading of the Bible there is no need for us to read a verse about purity <em></em> to experience the word of the cross. Genesis 1 does not speak of purity, but if we read Genesis 1, we will sense that we are impure. Then we will pray, &ldquo;Lord, I sense that I am dirty. Cleanse me.&rdquo; Although we may not realize it, this is an experience of the killing of the word of the cross. Moreover, when we are praying in this way, resurrection life is working in us. Thus, by reading any portion of the Bible, we can be purified by the killing and resurrecting word.</p>
<p>The word in the Bible does not mainly correct us; rather, it kills us and resurrects us. When a brother who is reading Revelation 1 encounters the word <em>lampstands</em> (vv. 12-13, 20), he may begin to sense within that he is in darkness, especially in dealing with his wife. He may confess, &ldquo;Lord, I am not in the light when I deal with my wife. Forgive me.&rdquo; In this kind of confession there is the killing of the word of the cross. When we pray and confess after reading any portion of the Word, we experience both the killing of the word of the cross and the resurrecting of the word of life. This killing and resurrecting will transform us, not merely correct us. The ethical teachings of Confucius result in correction, but the killing and resurrecting of the word of the cross and the word of life in the Bible issue in transformation.</p><h2 class="head2">Spending Time in the Word<br />
to Receive All Its Benefits</h2>
<p>Many saints have read in spiritual books that we have been crucified and resurrected with Christ. Some books teach that we need to reckon ourselves crucified and resurrected. After we learn this doctrine, we may begin to practice this. However, we will soon discover that this does not work. Reckoning does not work, because we do not receive the killing word or the resurrecting word by reckoning. Actually, we do not need to learn the doctrine of reckoning ourselves crucified and resurrected. As long as we spend time in the Word, the word of the cross will crucify us and the word of life will resurrect us, regardless of whether or not we know this doctrine. Regardless of whether or not children know that there are certain nourishing elements in their food, they will receive the benefits as long as they eat the food. Likewise, when we come to the Bible and receive the word of God, we will be nourished, refreshed, watered, washed, killed, and resurrected.</p>
<p>In order to receive all these benefits from the Word, we need to spend time in the Bible several times a day. Besides spending time in the Word in the morning, we can carry a small version of the New Testament and read a few verses or pray-read a verse from time to time. This is a good habit. This is the way for us to be crucified and resurrected. When we arrive at work, we may see a co-worker doing something wrong and become angry with him. However, if we read the Bible and pray-read a verse on the way to our job, we will not become angry with anyone; our old man will have been killed, and we will have been resurrected. Thus, we will arrive at work in resurrection. When we go home in the evening, we may become angry with our spouse. However, if we simply read the Word on the way home, we will not become angry, because our old man will have been crucified on the way. We will be a new man in resurrection. We do not need to reckon ourselves crucified; we need to be crucified. Neither do we need to reckon ourselves resurrected; we need to be resurrected. We can be crucified by the word of the cross and resurrected by the word of life.</p>
<p>The Bible is not constituted mainly with many teachings; rather, it is constituted with Christ, His death, and His resurrection. For this reason, we all need to spend time in the Bible to take the word into us and, if possible, to store the word within us. Colossians 3:16a says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; The word <em>dwell</em> here means &ldquo;to be in a house, to indwell, to inhabit.&rdquo; We should not consider that the words of the Bible are like the words in ordinary books. The Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing. It is our spiritual food, water, and air. It brings to us Christ as our life supply with His death and resurrection. All the spiritual riches are in the Word. If we do not read the Bible, we will be void of nourishment, refreshment, cleansing, Christ as our life supply, His death, and His resurrection. However, if we spend time in the Word day by day, the Word will convey all these riches into our being. Christianity teaches that we need to read the Bible merely to acquire knowledge. There is knowledge in the Bible, but the Word of God also contains God&rsquo;s breathing, cleansing, nourishing, the life supply of Christ, the killing of the word of the cross, and the resurrecting of the word of life. We need to come to the Word daily to receive all these benefits. In order to experience Christ, the fresh, instant killing of His death, and the fresh, instant resurrecting of His resurrection, we need to spend time in the Word every day.</p>
<p>Spending time in the Word is a life matter, but we need to do it legally so that we will not miss all the benefits it brings. We Christians should never be without the Word. We need to either carry a small Bible in our pocket or purse or memorize many verses. The Word of God is our real riches. It contains the elements we need in order to grow. We cannot grow by ourselves; we grow by the elements in the Word. By now we should see the importance of spending time in the Word daily. For over fifty years I have spent time in the Word every day. I will never regret this but rather will always be grateful to the Lord. He has preserved me for my entire Christian life mainly through the Bible. This dear book is precious to me; it has not left me for one day. The Bible has kept me from many distractions.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Trying to Understand the Bible</h2>
<p>The biggest frustration to understanding the Bible is trying to understand it. This thought may contradict our concept. We may think that when we read the Bible, the purpose is to understand it. There is certainly nothing wrong with understanding the Bible, but trying to understand it is a great mistake. We simply need to read the Bible; we do not need to try to understand it. The more we try to understand, the more we will not understand. There are two main ways of coming to the Bible: the way of eating and the way of reading. The way of eating, which we should practice especially in the morning, is to read and pray over a few verses. The way of reading, which we can practice in the afternoon or evening, is to read a few chapters. When coming to the Bible in the way of eating, we need to avoid exercising our mentality to understand what we read. This kind of exercise is a frustration to us. We simply need to come directly to the Bible and to God&rsquo;s presence by reading, praying, and pray-reading. We should not allow any kind of hindrance or distraction to come in. We simply need to read and pray-read.</p>
<p>Many portions of the Bible are difficult to understand. The first seventeen verses of the New Testament, for example, are in this category. Therefore, many Bible readers tend to skip the first seventeen verses of Matthew. However, we should not skip over any portion of the Word. We do not need to try to understand everything in the Bible; we simply need to read it. When we finish reading through the Bible the first time, we should read it a second time, then a third and a fourth time. Although we may not understand a portion the first time we read it, we may understand it the second or the third time. Also, we may not understand or receive any light from a portion at the time we read it. However, we may receive light from that portion years after we read it. Sometimes light will come through a portion of the Word a few days after we read it. We do not know when the light will come. Through the shining of the light, we are supplied and strengthened. Often while we are fighting against the devil, a strengthening supply will come from a portion of the Word that we read months or years before. The Bible is a wonderful book. We simply need to read it. Whether or not we understand as we read does not mean much.</p>
<p>Some may argue that if understanding the Bible does not mean much, they do not need to read it. This is wrong. We need to read the Bible, but we do not need to try to understand it. If we try to understand, we often will not understand, but if we simply read, we cannot avoid understanding. As long as we read, we will understand something. We will never read the Bible in vain. We will always receive something spontaneously. What we receive does not depend on us or our effort. If we endeavor to understand something, we will be frustrated. As we read, what is given to us depends on the Lord and His timing. The timing is not in our hands but in His. We simply need to build up a habit to daily and hourly read the Word. Then the Lord will send us the proper help of light, life, cleansing, killing, and resurrecting at the proper time. If we practice to daily read and pray-read the Bible, we will see a positive change and much growth in life after only a few months. I hope that all the saints would practice this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ANOINTING AND THE CONSCIENCE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exodus 30:23-25; 1 John 2:27; 1:7; 3:20-21; Heb. 9:14; 10:22; 1 Tim. 1:19; Acts 24:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE LORD<br />
BY TAKING CARE OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>John 15:1-8 concerns Christ as the vine and the believers as branches in the vine. However, the way for us to abide in the vine is not fully developed in the Gospel of John. Besides his Gospel, John also wrote three Epistles. In his first Epistle John continued to show the way to abide in Christ. According to 1 John 2:27, the way to abide in Christ is to take care of the anointing. The &ldquo;ing&rdquo; in the word <em>anointing</em> indicates that it is something moving and working. The moving of the ointment in the Bible is called the anointing. <em></em> When we apply an ointment to our skin, we rub it in. Hence, there is a moving. The anointing mentioned in 1 John comes from the holy anointing oil described in Exodus 30:23-25, which was a compound ointment. This anointing oil typifies the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The anointing gives us the way to abide in the vine.</p>
<p>Many branches are attached to a vine. The branches are not only attached to the vine but also abiding in the vine. The life-juice within the vine flows into the branches. By this flow the branches abide in the vine. The abiding of the branches in the vine is an illustration of the fellowship mentioned in 1 John 1:7. Fellowship is abiding, and abiding is carried out by the anointing. The dictionary tells us that to abide is to remain, indicating that the branches&rsquo; abiding in the vine is simply their remaining in the vine. However, in the Bible the word abiding, especially in reference to the branches&rsquo; relationship with the vine, means something more profound than merely to remain. The secret of our abiding in Christ as the vine is the anointing. The Gospel of John mentions the abiding (15:4-7). Then the first Epistle of John mentions the anointing, which is the way to abide. Revelation contains the reaping, the harvest, of the abiding. The abiding, the way to abide, and the harvest are three stages. In this chapter we will consider mainly the second stage, the way to abide.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Anointing Being the Moving and Working<br />
of the Spirit within Us</h2>
<p>The way to abide is by the anointing. All believers have the Spirit within them, and this Spirit is not silent, passive, or inactive. He is very active and aggressive and is constantly moving and working within us. The moving and working of the Holy Spirit within us is the anointing. If there is nothing or no one living within us, there will be no moving or working within us. However, every saved person has received the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 11). Therefore, every believer has the anointing within&mdash;something living, acting, moving, and working. God&rsquo;s salvation is not merely an objective matter, something outside of our being. God&rsquo;s salvation is subjective; it is a person within us. This person is God Himself as the life-giving Spirit within every believer. Every one of us has this moving person living in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Experience of the Anointing</h2>
<p>Before we were saved, we were always alone and lonely, regardless of our situation. Now that we are saved, it is altogether different. Wherever we go, Someone always goes with us, not outwardly but inwardly. We all have this experience. We love the Lord, but sometimes our love for Him wanes. Although many young brothers and sisters truly love the Lord, they may be attracted when a classmate, relative, or friend invites them to see a movie. They may pray, &ldquo;Lord, should I go or not?&rdquo; However, they may eventually be so attracted that they tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, sorry, just this one time do not go with me. Lord, would You give me leave just for three hours? Let me go to see the movie alone.&rdquo; A sister may see in a newspaper advertisement that a beautiful item is on sale at a department store. She may be quite attracted by the style as well as the price. She may have recently received a gift from her grandmother of the exact amount that she needs to buy the item. As a result, she may decide to go and buy it. When she considers the Lord Jesus, she may say, &ldquo;Lord, excuse me just for this time. Please stay home and allow me to go to the store alone.&rdquo; We have all done something like this. However, regardless of how much we ask the Lord to leave us alone, He will not. He always goes with us inwardly.</p>
<p>After I was saved as a young person, I sometimes told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I loved You yesterday, and I loved You this morning. However, now I am going to a certain place, and I do not want You to come with me. Lord, please stay home.&rdquo; I was bothered that the Lord would not stay home. Rather, He always went with me and in me. Moreover, He would ask me, &ldquo;Do you really enjoy your going?&rdquo; This question from within was the anointing&mdash;it was a living person moving and working within me. This working and moving, the anointing of the ointment, never leaves us. The ointment, which is the compound Spirit, anoints us day by day.</p>
<p>In certain places in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there has recently been a strange teaching that we can go anywhere because the Lord Jesus is with us wherever we go. According to this teaching, we can go to worldly places, such as movie theaters, because the Lord will go with us. The Lord goes with us to such places; however, He goes not to make us happy but to bother us. Before we were saved, no one bothered us when we went to the movies. However, now that we are saved, when we go to see a movie, the Lord Jesus will go with us to bother us. He may bother us by asking, &ldquo;Are you enjoying the movie?&rdquo; This inward asking is the anointing. Sometimes He says, &ldquo;Do not stay here any longer. Go home.&rdquo; Many of us have had this experience. A sister who is shopping in a department store may hear the anointing say, &ldquo;Do not touch that item.&rdquo; Eventually, she may hear, &ldquo;You should go home.&rdquo; After a few such experiences at a certain place, we may decide to never go back to that place. We may say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I will not ask You to leave me. I will stay with You.&rdquo; When we say this, we will immediately be filled with joy.</p>
<p>Christians often like to gossip. However, every time we gossip, we should sense something bothering us within. Many times when I begin to ask a brother about a certain person or matter, something within checks me, and I cannot continue. When we have this kind of experience, it is the anointing who stops us. This is a wonderful aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation. We are saved from hell once for all, but our salvation in our daily life is not once for all. We need to be saved every day by the anointing. Unbelievers can gossip and talk loosely without any inward problem, but believers cannot. We are saved from gossiping by the anointing. When I begin to speak loosely to my wife, I am often stopped by the anointing. When this happens, I go to my study and kneel down to pray, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; The Christian life is a life of being saved by the anointing.</p><h2 class="head2">The Type of the Anointing Oil</h2>
<p>The way to abide in the Lord is by the teaching of the anointing (1 John 2:27). The anointing is typified by the holy anointing oil, the compound ointment, described in Exodus 30:23-25. The compound ointment was made from a hin of olive oil compounded with four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. A hin is an ancient Hebrew unit of liquid measure. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, oil typifies the Spirit of God. In Exodus 30 the oil is no longer oil alone but is compounded with four spices to become an ointment. Oil has one essence and one element, but the compound ointment is a mixture of five elements. The anointing in the Bible is the anointing of the ointment. Myrrh, the first of the four spices added to the oil, signifies Christ&rsquo;s death in a positive sense. The death of Adam, which brought us all into death (Rom. 5:12), was negative, but the death of Christ, which rescued us out of death, is positive. Cinnamon signifies the effectiveness and sweetness of the death of Christ. Calamus is a reed that shoots up in muddy places, signifying resurrection. Cassia signifies the power and the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. In ancient times cassia was used as a snake and insect repellent. The effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection repels the serpent, Satan, and all the negative &ldquo;insects&rdquo; that come to bother us.</p>
<p>The quantities of the spices are also significant. There were five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon, two hundred fifty shekels of calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia. The two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus compose one unit of five hundred shekels split in two. Thus, there are three units of five hundred shekels each, and the middle unit is cut in half. These three units signify the three of the Triune God, and the middle unit that was split signifies Christ the Son, the second of the Godhead, who was &ldquo;split&rdquo; on the cross. The number of spices, four, signifies the creatures, the foremost of which is man (Ezek. 1:5; Rev. 4:6). The combining of the numbers three and four implies the mingling of the Triune God with His creature man. Three multiplied by four is twelve, which is the number of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, twelve foundations, and measures twelve thousand stadia in all three dimensions (Rev. 21:12, 14, 16). Thus, the type of the compound ointment is the source of the number of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>The olive oil being compounded with the four spices signifies the Spirit of God being compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, His death, and His resurrection. Everything Christ is and has accomplished has all been compounded into the Spirit of God. For this reason the Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). Such a Spirit was not yet before Jesus was glorified, that is, before He was resurrected. The Spirit mentioned in John 7:39 is the compound Spirit. Now that Christ has died and resurrected, the Spirit of God has become a wonderful compound Spirit. This compound Spirit includes the divinity of the Triune God, the humanity of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s death, the effectiveness of His death, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Contents of the Spirit<br />
and the Word Being the Same</h2>
<p>My burden is not that we would merely gain some biblical knowledge but that we would see that the contents of the Spirit and the word of God are the same. In the previous chapter we saw that the constituents of God&rsquo;s word in the Bible are Christ, His death, and His resurrection. Every page of the Bible contains Christ, His death, and His resurrection. The word of God may be compared to a cup of tea that contains tea and several other ingredients, such as lemon, milk, and honey, compounded together into an all-inclusive drink. When we drink such a cup of tea, we receive all the ingredients. That which is in the word is in the Spirit also. Christ is a constituent of the word, and Christ has also been compounded into the Spirit. Christ&rsquo;s death is in the word, and His death has also been compounded into the Spirit. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is a constituent of the word, and His resurrection has also been compounded into the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit and the word correspond. Actually, the word is the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). The word of God in the Bible, which is outside of us, becomes the Spirit when we take it into us. When the Spirit comes out of us, He becomes the word again. The word without is the Spirit within; these two are one. Christ, His death, and His resurrection are included in both the word and the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Daily Need to Take In the Word<br />
and Touch the Spirit</h2>
<p>Many saints have learned the teaching that we have been crucified and resurrected and that we now need to reckon ourselves crucified and resurrected. I did much reckoning when I was young. However, today I have seen that the way is not to reckon but to take in the word and touch the Spirit. Because Christ&rsquo;s death and the effectiveness of His death are in the word and in the Spirit, when we receive the word and touch the Spirit, we enjoy and participate in Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness. Being crucified with Christ is not a matter of knowledge or reckoning; it is a matter of taking in the word and touching the Spirit because within the word and within the Spirit are the death of Christ and the effectiveness of His death.</p>
<p>If we do not open the Bible for a month or even a week, yet we attempt to reckon ourselves dead, we will still be very alive in many sinful things. Day after day there is no killing power within us because we do not take the word into us. If we do not eat physical food for a week, we will be susceptible to many diseases. As long as we eat the proper food, we will have the killing element, the natural antibiotics, to kill the germs. If we do not eat properly for a period of time, there will be a lack of the killing element in our body. Many negative germs will begin to work, and we will become sick. We need a daily killing not only in our physical life but also in our spiritual life. As long as we are on the earth, many spiritual germs will enter into us through the things we see in the sinful environment that surrounds us. Therefore, we daily need the inward killing of the spiritual antibiotics to kill the spiritual germs within us. This killing power is in the word and in the Spirit. When we read the Bible and pray, taking in the word and touching the Spirit, we receive the killing element of the death of Christ.</p>
<p>If a brother does not read the Bible for one month, he may often lose his temper with his wife. It will not be necessary to ask him whether or not he has read the Bible regularly; we can simply ask his wife, &ldquo;How has your husband&rsquo;s temper been?&rdquo; If she replies that he has frequently lost his temper, we will know that the brother has not been reading the Bible daily, because the negative things within him have become prevailing. He lacks the killing element because he does not take in the word. We need to legally spend at least ten minutes in the Bible every morning. If the brother begins to spend only ten minutes per day in the Word, perhaps after only a week his wife will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! My husband has had a wonderful change. He did not lose his temper once this week.&rdquo; Moreover, when we read the Bible, we surely will pray. No one eats and does not drink. Everyone who eats also drinks. By reading the Bible and praying, we take in the word and touch the Spirit, both of which contain Christ, His death, and His resurrection. It is in this way that we abide in the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading the Bible Being Necessary<br />
to Understand the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p>First John 2:27 says, &ldquo;His anointing teaches you.&rdquo; The word <em>teaches</em> indicates that the moving of the compound Spirit is full of meaning. However, we need the proper knowledge of the Bible to understand the meaning of the Spirit&rsquo;s moving. For this reason, we all need to read the Bible to accumulate the necessary knowledge. Children must be taught the meaning of certain words before they can be expected to fully understand their parents. The anointing teaches us within, but if we do not have the adequate knowledge of the Bible, we will not understand the meaning of the moving within us. The Spirit moves with meaning, with some significance, but we need the spiritual knowledge to understand it.</p>
<p>We need to read the Bible to receive the spiritual education necessary to become spiritually qualified to understand the teaching of the anointing. If a person speaks to us in a language we do not know, although we hear the sounds of the person&rsquo;s speaking, we will not understand the meaning. Because we lack the necessary knowledge and education, we are not qualified to understand the person&rsquo;s speaking. However, if we know the language, we will understand the person&rsquo;s speaking. We need to spend time in the Word to accumulate biblical knowledge so that we will become spiritually qualified and prepared to understand the teaching of the anointing. A brother who was recently saved can understand only a little of the teaching of the anointing within him, but a brother who has been saved and has read the Word for many years can understand much more when the anointing moves within him. The anointing within these two brothers may be the same, but their understanding will differ greatly because their preparation differs. This is the reason that we all need to spend time in the Word.</p>
<p>Reading the Word is never a waste of time. I encourage the saints to be legal about their Bible reading. When Brother Watchmen Nee was young, he decided to read the New Testament once a week for one year. He was able to do this by carrying a small Bible with him everywhere he went. Whenever he was unoccupied for any amount of time, he would read a few lines. After reading the New Testament fifty-two times in such a way, a clear knowledge of the Word was surely wrought into his being. When the compound Spirit anoints such a person, he understands the full meaning of the anointing. We will never feel that we have read the Bible too much. By reading the Bible, we accumulate the knowledge we need to understand the teaching of the anointing, which enables us to abide in the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE LORD<br />
BY DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Our Conscience, the Entrance of Our Spirit, Needing to Be Opened and Cleansed</h2>
<p>In order to enter into anything, there is the need of an entrance, a gate. The gate of our spirit is our conscience. Most people first believe when their conscience is touched through the hearing of the gospel. Proper gospel preaching leads people to repentance and confession, which are matters of the conscience. When we repent and confess our sins to the Lord, we touch and open our conscience. Then the blood of Christ cleanses our conscience. Hebrews 9:14 says, &ldquo;How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?&rdquo; When we believe into the Lord Jesus and repent and confess to Him, we open our conscience, and the blood purifies our conscience. Therefore, the gate to our spirit is opened and cleansed. Then the Holy Spirit enters into our spirit. This shows the importance of purifying, cleansing, and dealing with our conscience. If our conscience is open and cleansed by the blood, the Spirit will enter into our spirit.</p>
<p>First John 3:20 says, &ldquo;If our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart and knows all things.&rdquo; The conscience is a part of both the spirit and the heart. Therefore, for our heart to condemn us is for our conscience to condemn us. In order to contact the Lord and abide in Him, we must deal with our conscience. If we do not deal with an offense, our conscience will condemn us, and this will frustrate our abiding in the Lord. Hence, we need to diligently deal with our conscience. In 1 Timothy 1:19 Paul wrote, &ldquo;Holding faith and a good conscience,&rdquo; and in Acts 24:16 he testified, &ldquo;I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confession Being Necessary<br />
to Properly Abide in the Lord</h2>
<p>We have seen that in order to abide in Christ, we need to take in the word and touch the Spirit. We touch the Spirit with our spirit, and the gate of our spirit is our conscience. Thus, we must take care of our conscience. If we lose our temper with our spouse, when we try to the touch the Spirit and take in the word the following morning, there will be an offense in our conscience, and our conscience will condemn us. If we do not deal with this offense, it will frustrate us from abiding in the Lord. Therefore, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I confess to You that I lost my temper with my dear spouse. Lord, forgive me and cleanse me.&rdquo; The Lord will probably answer, &ldquo;Go and confess to your spouse and ask for forgiveness.&rdquo; If we would do this, our conscience will be cleared up immediately, and the gate of our spirit will be wide open. Then the anointing will move in us, and we will abide in the vine. In this way we can have fellowship with the Lord and participate in all the riches of the life-juice of the vine. As a result, we will live the vine, grow the vine, and produce the vine.</p>
<p>We need to come to the Bible and pray to the Lord daily to take in the word and touch the Spirit. When we do this, our conscience will be touched and will become sensitive. When our conscience is seared, it becomes dull and loses its sensitivity. Then there is no sensation within our conscience. However, if we come to the Lord, take in His word, touch His Spirit, and ask Him to cleanse us with His precious blood, our conscience will become very sensitive. Then our conscience will immediately sense any matter in which we are wrong so that we can confess it and be cleansed by the blood. In this way we can continually abide in the vine. The way to abide in the vine is to spend time in the Bible and pray to take in the word and touch the Spirit. If we do this, our conscience will surely be touched and will function to give us a sensation when we are wrong in any matter or with any person. Then we can confess our wrongdoings to deal with our conscience. At first we may feel that we are wrong in only a few matters, but if we confess these matters, we will see that there are many more matters we need to confess.</p>
<p>Some may feel that the way of dealing with the conscience by thorough confession is difficult, but this is the only way, and there are no shortcuts. Many of us do not properly abide in the Lord because our conscience is covered with many offenses and has become seared and dull, losing the proper sensation. However, if we would sincerely touch the word and the Spirit&mdash;taking in the word by pray-reading, touching our spirit, and asking the Lord to cleanse us&mdash;the light will shine on our conscience and cause it to become sensitive. Then we need to continue to confess our offenses and sins according to the sensation of our conscience. Such confession will lead us to confess more and more of our offenses and wrongdoings. Eventually, our conscience will be thoroughly purified, like a washed window.</p>
<p>A purified conscience is a highway and an open gate for us to contact the Lord and for the Lord to come into us. It will issue in much traffic between us and the Lord, which will keep us in the proper condition of abiding in Him. Such abiding will bring us the rich supply of the life-juice of the vine for our enjoyment. Then we will surely grow the vine and produce the vine. According to my experience, this is the proper way. It is by this way that we can grow and produce Christ. Moreover, in the word and in the Spirit are the rich Christ, His effective death, and His powerful resurrection in a very subjective and experiential way for our enjoyment. I hope that we would all receive this word and put it into practice, daily coming to the Lord and the Word, pray-reading to take in the word, touching the Spirit, and dealing with our conscience to experience the cleansing of the blood. This will bring us into the proper abiding. Then we will truly live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2b, 6-7, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Phil. 1:21a; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapters we have seen that God&rsquo;s economy is Christ as the vine and that the way to abide in this vine is to take in the word and touch the Spirit. This chapter and the following chapters will cover certain basic truths in the New Testament. We will begin in this chapter by considering what the church is. Many saints may know that the church is the house of God, the Body of Christ, the manifestation of God in the flesh, the dwelling place of God, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the mystery of Christ, the one new man, the increase of Christ, and Christ&rsquo;s bride and wife (1 Tim. 3:15-16; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:15, 20-22; 3:6; 5:25-32; Col. 3:10-11; John 3:29-30; Rev. 19:7). This knowledge indicates the extraordinary knowledge of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Although I was born, raised, and educated in Christianity, I never heard these terms. However, we need to see that the most basic definition of the church is that the church is Christ.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; Although this verse concerns the Body of Christ, the concluding words are not <em>the Body</em> but <em>the Christ,</em> proving that the church is Christ. It is logical to say that Christ is both the Head and the Body, for every person is not only a head but also a body. In chapter 1 of this book we saw that God&rsquo;s economy is the vine. The vine, like all trees, is not only a trunk but also the branches. The complete tree includes the branches. We need to see that the church is Christ.</p>
<p>Some theologians may think that it is a blasphemy to say that the church is Christ. However, the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21a). To live Christ is not to be deified to become a member of the Godhead; rather, to live Christ is to be a member of Christ that has the life and nature of Christ, just as all the parts of our body have the life and the nature of our person. As the branches of Christ, the true vine, we surely have the life and the nature of the vine. Because we have the same life and nature as Christ, we are parts of Christ, and we may even say that we are Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is God with the Godhead. We as His members have His divine life and nature, but we do not have the Godhead. We have the same life and nature as Christ, but we do not have His Godhead. The Godhead belongs uniquely to Christ, but His life and nature belong to Him and also to us. Although we do not have Christ&rsquo;s Godhead, we have His life and nature (Rom. 5:10; Col. 3:4). Therefore, we are part of Christ, and corporately, as the Body, we are Christ. Christ is the Head, and we are the Body. Both the Head and the Body are Christ. Thus, the church is Christ. This is not merely a doctrine but a crucial vision for the practice of the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen that the church is Christ, we need to go on to see who and what Christ is. It is beyond our capacity to know everything concerning who and what Christ is, but Colossians reveals several crucial items of Christ. Ephesians and Colossians are two extraordinary books in the New Testament. Ephesians concerns mainly the Body, the church, and Colossians concerns mainly the Head, Christ. Therefore, in order to know who and what Christ is, we need to come to Colossians. It is a short book, but it gives us a profound revelation of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>Colossians first reveals that Christ is the portion of the saints (1:12). As believers in Christ, we gain Christ as our portion. Most Christians speak of our portion as being only redemption, salvation, and heaven. It is easy to understand that these items are our portion. However, it is more difficult to understand what it means for Christ to be our portion and how to enjoy Him as our portion. When we drink a cup of coffee, the coffee is our portion. When we eat breakfast, all the items included in our breakfast are our portion. We need to see the many items that are included in Christ as our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Image of the Invisible God,<br />
the Firstborn of All Creation,<br />
and the One in Whom, through Whom,<br />
and unto Whom All Things Were Created</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ, who is our portion, is the image of the invisible God. God is invisible, yet He has an image that is visible. In Christ we know God and see God (John 1:18; 14:7-11). God is revealed and made visible in Christ. God is visible to us because Christ our portion is the image of the invisible God.</p>
<p>Verse 15 of Colossians 1 also says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Although Christ is the Creator, this verse says that He is the Firstborn of all creation. Some Christian theologians think that it is heresy to say that Christ, who as God is the Creator, is also part of creation. No one can explain this mysterious fact, but it is clearly stated in the Bible.</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;In Him all things were created...all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto, or for, Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Who Is before All Things<br />
and the One in Whom All Things Cohere</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him.&rdquo; The word <em>cohere</em> means to subsist together. This matter may be illustrated by the way the spokes of a wheel subsist in the hub. If the hub is removed, the spokes and the wheel will fall apart. The hub is the center that keeps all the other parts of the wheel together. Scientists have discovered that there is a hub, a center, that holds everything in the universe together. Christ is this hub. Everything in the universe coheres in Christ. To cohere is to exist in a particular way. We exist in a particular way, because apparently we are standing on the earth, but intrinsically the earth is holding us. Without the holding power of the earth, we would fly off into space. There is a cohering power in the universe. Everything in the universe, including each of us, coheres in Christ. He is the hub of the universe that holds all things. Without Christ as the holding power, everything in the universe would fall apart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Head of the Body, the Beginning,<br />
the Firstborn from the Dead,<br />
the One Who Has the First Place in All Things, and the One in Whom<br />
All the Fullness Was Pleased to Dwell</h2>
<p>Verses 18 through 19 say, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; Christ is the Firstborn in creation and the Firstborn in resurrection. God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation. The new creation was produced in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ is the Firstborn in both creations, in the old creation and the new creation. Christ is the first in everything. In Him all the fullness, the full expression of the rich being of God in both the creation and the church, was pleased to dwell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of God and the One in Whom<br />
All the Fullness of the Godhead Dwells Bodily</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God. God is altogether a mystery, and this mystery is Christ. In other words, Christ is the definition of God. Then verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; The fullness of the Godhead, the expression of the riches of what God is, dwells in Christ as one who has a human body. We could never fully explain or define all that Christ is. I do not have the adequate knowledge to expound all the profound items of Christ revealed in Colossians. We could never even exhaust the significance of the two terms <em>the mystery of God</em> and <em>the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead.</em></p><h2 class="head2">The Reality of Every Positive Thing</h2>
<p>Christ is also the reality of every positive thing, such as food, water, air, and sunshine. Verses 16 through 17 say, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; The food we eat, holidays, and the Sabbath day are not real; they are shadows. Christ is the real food, the real holiday, and the real Sabbath. A holiday, a feast, is a happy day, but if we do not have Christ, we cannot be joyful. If we have Christ, every day is a happy day. The Sabbath is for rest. If we do not have Christ, we do not have rest. Christ is also the reality of the new moon, which signifies a new beginning with light in the darkness. When others are disappointed and everything is in darkness, we have a bright new beginning and a new hope in Christ. The first day of the week should not be called Sunday, a word that is pagan in origin, but the Lord&rsquo;s Day (Rev. 1:10). Christ is our first day of the week, the beginning of a new period. Our new beginning is Christ. Christ is everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All and in All in the New Man</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 reveals that Christ is all and in all in the new man. These verses say, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The new man is the church. In the new man there is no place for any natural man, because in the new man Christ is all. Christ has the unique place in the new man. He is every member, and He is in every member. This truth is difficult to fully explain, but we need to declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Christ is me, and Christ is in me!&rdquo; In the new man there are no Americans, Chinese, or any other nationality or race, but Christ is all and in all. Christ is all of us, and Christ is in all of us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Life and Our Hope of Glory</h2>
<p>Verse 4 reveals that Christ is our life, and 1:27 reveals that He is our hope of glory. Christ is our life today and will be our glory in the future. Therefore, He is our hope.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A CONTROLLING VISION</h2>
<p>We need not merely to know the doctrine but to see a vision that the church is Christ. We also need to see a vision of who and what Christ is. Christ, who is our portion, is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, and the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created. He is also the One who is before all things and the One in whom all things cohere. Christ is the Head of the Body, the beginning, and the Firstborn from the dead. He has the preeminence in all things, and all the fullness, the full expression of God in both creation and the church, is pleased to dwell in Him. Christ is also the mystery of God, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, and the reality of every positive thing. Every positive thing in the universe is only a shadow, a type, of Christ. The light we see is only a shadow. The body, the reality, of all light is Christ (John 8:12; 9:5). The air we breathe is a shadow of Christ, who is our real air (20:22). The water we drink is not the real water; the real water is Christ (4:14; 7:37-39). The food we eat day by day is not the real food; the real food is Christ (6:35). Christ is our real clothing, our real covering (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27). Christ is everything. We also need to see that Christ is all and in all in the new man, the church. Therefore, every part of the Body is Christ, and Christ is in every part of the Body.</p>
<p>Christ being all and in all in the church should be a controlling vision to us to repel all foreign things from the church. Anything besides Christ is foreign to the church. Christ is the only proper constituent of the church. In the new man there is nothing but Christ. Christ is every part of the church and is in every part of the church. This Christ is our portion; we can enjoy Christ as the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created, the One who is before all things, the One in whom all things cohere, the Head of the Body, the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, the One who has the preeminence in all things, the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell, the mystery of God, the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the reality of every positive thing, and the One who is all and in all in the church. We should not consider Christ&rsquo;s being all and in all in the church as merely a doctrine; this needs to be a vision to us. Such a vision will transform our concept, our mentality, our emotion, our sensation, and every part of our being. This vision will also control, direct, safeguard, and preserve us in the proper church life. The foremost truth we need to see in the New Testament is that the church is nothing but Christ.</p>
<p>We need this controlling vision because in today&rsquo;s Christianity there is much confusion, division, darkness, and death. If we do not have Christ as all and in all in our church life, we will immediately have confusion, division, darkness, and death. Confusion comes in when Christ is missing. Once confusion comes in, division will quickly follow, then darkness, and finally death. If Christ is present, confusion is gone. If we have Christ, we will have a proper order instead of confusion, genuine oneness instead of division, light instead of darkness, and life instead of death. The vision of the church being Christ keeps us under a strict control and direction.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DANGER OF CERTAIN CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>The vision of the church being Christ repels all kinds of concepts. If we all take Christ as everything, there will be no concepts. Nothing can banish our concepts but Christ. If we lack a clear vision of the church being Christ and of Christ being the unique constituent of the church, many concepts will gradually creep in. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in the United States for about sixteen years. In the first thirteen or fourteen years there were no concepts but only Christ as all. However, in the last few years certain concepts have subtly crept in to replace Christ and cause division.</p>
<p>One concept is related to going to movie theaters and playing sports. Some who have promoted these activities among the saints say that there is too much legality, religion, and bondage in the local churches. Several saints recently asked me if attending the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting is being religious and going to play sports is being liberated. Some think that they will have more life if they are &ldquo;liberated&rdquo;; they think that liberation is life. Life itself is a mystery, but the experience of life is always simple. It is wrong to complicate the way to experience life. Breathing is the most crucial thing for our existence, but it is very simple. The life necessities of breathing, eating, drinking, and sleeping are all simple. We should not be complicated by false concepts, such as the notion that attending movies or playing sports rather than attending the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting is liberation and will cause us to have more life. We need to be simple. We should simply consider whether or not we enjoy the Lord when we attend a movie or play sports. I do not believe that anyone who attends a church meeting rather than a movie or athletic activity will regret it or repent of it in eternity. What is right or wrong does not matter. We should not argue about concepts. Debates lead nowhere. We simply need to recognize the facts concerning which activities cause us to enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>In a prayer meeting in a small locality a leading one recently said that it is possible for those who were born with a strong disposition not to smoke or drink but that the Lord forgives those who were born with a weak disposition because they cannot avoid these habits. We should never accept this kind of word. This kind of teaching will lead to the indulgence of lusts. We need to realize that regardless of how spiritual we might be, we are still in the flesh. I am an old man who has been saved for half a century, but I still do not trust my flesh. If I am only a little loose, many kinds of lusts will still come out of my flesh. Since the fall of man, God has ordained many restrictions to protect fallen human beings. The laws of the government, parental discipline, and self-control are God-ordained restrictions. We are still living in the old creation with our corrupted flesh. There are many opportunities for us to fall into the indulgence of lusts. Movies and sports will never cause us to enjoy Christ, but they may lead us into the indulgence of lusts.</p>
<p>The Bible says that the church is the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4). If we go to movie theaters, we will lose the Lord&rsquo;s testimony before our relatives, classmates, and colleagues. If our colleagues invite us to see a movie, we should testify to them, &ldquo;Thank you, but because I am a follower of Jesus, I would never go to that kind of place.&rdquo; They may appear to be offended, but deep within they will appreciate the fact that we are an honest and true follower of Jesus. We need to build up a strong testimony of Jesus. For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we cannot do many things that unbelievers can do. We may often pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; However, if we truly love the Lord, we will not go to a movie theater, for we cannot enjoy Him or build up His testimony by going to a theater. This is not a matter of right or wrong or of being loose or strict; it is a matter of fact. The testimony of Jesus will be torn down in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if the Lord&rsquo;s recovery becomes as loose as Christianity. We all need to rise up to tell the Lord that we desire to be strict for the sake of His testimony. For the sake of the enjoyment of the Lord and the testimony of Jesus, we need the proper standing and environment. Our unique standing is Christ, and our unique environment also is Christ. We all need to take Christ as our unique standing and not bring in any foreign concepts. Our one standing and our one environment should be Christ.</p>
<p>Regardless of our age or background, the simple way to be proper according to the facts is not to be loose by going to movie theaters or athletic activities but to be one with Christ. Our unique way is Christ. This does not mean that we do not need to exercise. Actually, we need to exercise every day to keep our bodies healthy. Exercise exhausts our lusts, but many sports stir up our lusts. We can exercise and maintain a proper testimony by cleaning our home and caring for our lawn rather than participating in something worldly. This is my word of love. I am healthy even at my age because every day I exercise by cleaning and walking. While I walk, I talk to the Lord. I do not believe that we can talk to the Lord while playing sports. I had much exposure to sports as a young person. My school had volleyball, tennis, and soccer teams. I was on the soccer team, but one day after I was saved, I could not kick the ball when it came to me. It seemed that my foot would not work. Someone within was controlling me. I quit playing soccer that day and never played again. Nevertheless, I am still healthy today, and I have much enjoyment of the Lord. Therefore, I am qualified to be commissioned to speak for the Lord. I hope that we will all rise up to be the proper testimony of Jesus. We need to drop and cast away all worldly concepts. We should have only one concept, that is, Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is crucial to see the way to enjoy our wonderful Christ. First Corinthians 15:45b says that He became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>spirit</em> in these verses is <em>pneuma,</em> which can be translated &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; &ldquo;air,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; Today the wonderful, mysterious, all-inclusive Christ has become the life-giving <em>pneuma,</em> that is, the life-giving air, the life-giving breath. Air does not need to be purchased, cooked, or prepared in any way. Air is always available and easy to receive. The wonderful, mysterious, profound, and all-inclusive Christ is impossible to fully comprehend but easy to enjoy. We do not need knowledge to enjoy Christ as the life-giving air. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is within us. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; Christ is available and near; He is in our spirit. This is a great blessing. We need to contact Him in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to the spirit. To walk means to have our being. Rather than arguing about whether we should attend movies or athletic activities, we should simply walk according to the spirit moment by moment and day by day. I am confident that the spirit will never direct us to a worldly activity. Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. We should have our being according to the Spirit in our spirit. The Spirit becomes the anointing within us. We need to walk according to this anointing. While we are speaking, the anointing may restrict us from saying something. We should speak only from the spirit and according to the anointing. This should be the principle of our daily life. When we talk to our spouse, we should do so according to the anointing. If we try to argue according to the anointing, we will have nothing to say because the anointing will not lead us that way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING CHRIST<br />
TO EXHIBIT CHRIST IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>To daily and hourly walk and have our being according to the inner anointing is to walk and have our being by Christ. It is in this way that we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. When Christ thus becomes our practical daily living, living Christ will not be a doctrine to us but will be our reality. Moreover, if we walk and have our being according to the spirit until Christ becomes our daily living, we will come to the meetings with something of Christ to share and release to all the saints. The meetings will be rich and genuine, an exhibition of our daily life.</p>
<p>Sometimes our meetings are a performance. If we quarrel with someone before the meeting, we are performing when we come to the meeting and say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!&rdquo; The angels will know that we are acting. This makes the meeting hall a theater. Sometimes our activities in the meetings are theatrical performances; they are not real. To simply shout is not real. The meetings should be a genuine exhibition of our daily life, a window to allow others to see what kind of life we live. This is the way to have proper meetings of the church and the way to have a genuine practice of the church that is altogether Christ. Christ is the church; therefore, Christ should be our daily living and our meetings. We should meet not only in Christ and for Christ but also with Christ. Our meetings should exhibit Christ. Christ should be the unique constituent of the church, our daily life, and the meetings. This is the first basic truth in the New Testament. This truth should be a vision to all of us that controls our concept concerning the church, our daily living, and the meetings. The church, our daily living, and the meetings should all be Christ in a practical way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE GENUINE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 17:21-23; 1 Cor. 1:12-13; Eph. 4:2-6, 13-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE ONENESS BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the truth in the New Testament concerning the genuine oneness of the church. Christians today often speak of oneness, but there are many kinds of oneness that are not genuine. We need to realize that there is only one kind of oneness that is genuine. In the previous chapter we saw that the church is Christ. In this chapter we will see that the genuine oneness of the church also is Christ. Because Christ is the proper and real church life, He is the genuine oneness.</p>
<p>We are one in the church not because we have a common concept, goal, interest, or work. These factors could never create the genuine oneness. If we are one because of these factors, our oneness is not the genuine oneness. Any kind of oneness besides the genuine oneness is a oneness in division. Every denomination has a certain kind of oneness. The Catholic Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Baptist Church all have a kind of oneness. In any Christian work there is a kind of oneness. Without some kind of oneness, no one would work together. There is a multitude of different denominations, and there is a multitude of different kinds of oneness. The oneness of the Christians in the Methodist Church is their method. The oneness of those in the Baptist Church is in the practice of baptism by immersion. The oneness of Pentecostals is mainly speaking in tongues. However, even in tongue-speaking there are different kinds of oneness. Not all agree on how to speak in tongues. Those who speak in tongues are not one even in tongue-speaking. Thus, there are many kinds of oneness among the denominations, but none are genuine.</p>
<p>We can be genuinely one only because of Christ. Christ is in every genuine believer, and this indwelling Christ is our real oneness. If we do not see this, we will not be able to be one with those of different nationalities and backgrounds, nor will we even be able to be one with our own spouse. Not many couples are one. Apart from Christ no human being can be one with anyone else. In other words, no two people are one without Christ. The genuine oneness is Christ. There is no oneness apart from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS REVEALED IN JOHN 17:21-23</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Triune God</h2>
<p>John 17:21-23 is a deep portion of the Word. In verse 21 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the secret for the believers to be one is to be in the Triune God. If we are outside of the Triune God, we are not one. The genuine oneness is possible only when we are in the Triune God, not only in doctrine and position but also in experience. We have the genuine oneness when we are practically and experientially living in the Triune God. Christians do not have the genuine oneness because very few Christians live in the Triune God. They may believe that they are in the Triune God, but they do not live in the Triune God. Their walk, their daily life, and their work are altogether outside and apart from the Triune God. Therefore, although there are many genuine believers, there is no genuine oneness among them, because the genuine oneness, which is Christ Himself, is only in the Triune God.</p>
<p>In order to have the genuine oneness, we first need to be in the Triune God. As believers, we are all in the Triune God doctrinally and positionally, but we may not be in the Triune God experientially. If we go to a movie theater, we surely are not experientially in the Triune God. We also may not be in the Triune God in all the areas of our moment-by-moment daily living, such as our relationships with our family members or roommates. Rather than being in the Triune God experientially, we are often in our self, our choice, our preference, our flesh, our jealousy, our hatred, or our pride. Although we know that we need the genuine oneness, we often lack this oneness because we do not live in the Triune God. As long as we are not in the Triune God, the oneness among us is not secure. The genuine oneness is safeguarded and secured only by our being in the Triune God practically and experientially in our daily living.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Glory of the Triune God</h2>
<p>In verse 22 the Lord continued, &ldquo;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&rdquo; The genuine oneness is in the glory of the Triune God. There is something in the universe called the glory of the Triune God. This glory is the glory that the Father has given to the Son and that the Son has given to His believers that they may be one. We may not fully understand what this glory is, but we can see that glory is surely something of God and that it is in this glory that we can all be one. It is possible for all of us to be one only when we are in the glory of the Triune God. Simply put, glory is God expressed. This matter may be illustrated using electricity. Electricity is hidden until it is expressed as light. The shining of light is the glory of electricity. Likewise, the expression of the Triune God is the glory of the Triune God. When we are all in the expression of God, we are one.</p>
<p>Over the years I have seen many dear saints come into the recovery who truly love the Lord and stay for some time but who eventually leave in division. Some were even co-workers. They left in division simply because they were not living absolutely in the Triune God. Regardless of who we are, if we are not in fear and trembling to live in the Triune God every day, we may eventually cause a division. The only way to be kept in the genuine oneness is to daily live first in the Triune God and second in the expression of God, in the glory that the Father has given the Son and that the Son has given the believers. In this glory, the expression of the Triune God, our genuine oneness is doubly secure.</p>
<p>We need to be not only in the Triune God but also with all the saints in His expression. Our work should be for the expression of God, not for our own success, goal, or purpose. The expression of the Triune God has the power to kill all our ambition, goals, and desire for success. Every human being is purposeful, having his or her own goals, intentions, and aims. Until all our personal goals, intentions, and aims have been killed for the sake of the expression of the Triune God, we are not secure in the genuine oneness. The church life is the expression of the Triune God. God&rsquo;s economy and the work of God&rsquo;s economy are for the expression of the Triune God. If we have any goal, aim, and intention other than the expression of the Triune God, we will eventually lose the genuine oneness. Eventually, we will become a cause of division because of our differing goals, aims, and intentions. In order for the genuine oneness to be secured, we must first live in the Triune God and second be in the expression of the Triune God. This expression will kill all our goals, aims, and intentions.</p>
<p>Every Christian denomination has been divided. Even a small group may be divided after meeting for only two or three years. Christians today cannot be one but are endlessly divided because most do not live in the Triune God and do not care for the expression of God. They care instead for their own goals, aims, and intentions, or even worse, for their personal tastes, choices, or preferences. Because their goals, aims, intentions, tastes, choices, and preferences are not the expression of God, the genuine oneness among them is not secure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Being in Us<br />
and Our Being Perfected into One</h2>
<p>The Lord goes on to pray in verse 23, &ldquo;I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; Verse 21 indicates that we are in the Triune God; verse 23 indicates that the Triune God is in us. The Triune God being in us is more experiential than our being in the Triune God. We need to consider whether or not the Triune God is in us experientially. Perhaps instead of the Triune God, some other person or matter is in us. Doctrinal differences are excuses; they are not the real reason that Christians cannot be one. The real reason is that they do not live in the Triune God, they do not care for the expression of the Triune God, and they do not have the Triune God in them experientially.</p>
<p>To be perfected into one, we need to be in the Triune God, we need to be for the expression of the Triune God, and the Triune God needs to be in us. We may be one, but our oneness has not yet been perfected. Even the genuine oneness needs to be perfected. We all need to be perfected into one. Although we have all been regenerated and love the Lord and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the degree of our oneness may not be very high because we have not been perfected into one. The way to be perfected into one is not by outward correction but by the Triune God working in us. The more the Triune God is in us, the more we will be perfected into the genuine oneness. Although we love the Lord, we still have our tastes and are still natural, fleshly, and selfish in the old man. As long as these negative things exist, our degree of oneness is not very high. Therefore, we need the indwelling Triune God to work in us to eliminate all these negative things. Then we will be perfected into one. The degree of our oneness will be high, and our oneness will be strong and secure.</p>
<p>All the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery surely have oneness, but our oneness is not very deep, high, or secure, for we are not absolutely in the Triune God, and the Triune God is not fully in us. We all need to be filled with the Triune God so that He can work in us to perfect us into one. Then our oneness will be deeper, higher, and more secure. John 17:21-23 shows that the genuine oneness is not easy to obtain. If our oneness is not deep, it is because we are not allowing the Triune God to work in us. We need the Triune God to work in us to eliminate all the negative things within us so that we may be perfected into one. Our oneness needs to be solid and unbreakable. Although our oneness today is genuine, it is not solid and strong. The oneness among us is fragile because our living in the Triune God is not deep, we do not care enough for God&rsquo;s expression, and the Triune God&rsquo;s working within us is limited.</p><h2 class="head2">Praying according to John 17:21-23<br />
concerning the Genuine Oneness</h2>
<p>John 17:21-23 is a healthy word containing a great revelation. The thought in these verses is beyond our human understanding. Nevertheless, we need to be impressed with these three main points: our being in the Triune God (v. 21), the glory, the expression, of the Triune God that makes us one (v. 22), and the Triune God being in us that we may be perfected into one (v. 23). We need to bring these three points to the Lord in prayer.</p>
<p>To keep the oneness, we need the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Many saints may be spontaneously and naturally in the oneness today, but they may not have been tested yet. When a test comes, they may feel that they cannot keep the oneness. The word in this chapter is intended to help us to realize the need of the genuine oneness. Although we may have been in the church life for years, we may easily fall out of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we lack the genuine oneness. John 17:21-23 reveals what the genuine oneness is and the way for us to have the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS LIFE BEING<br />
THE NATURE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
AND ONENESS BEING THE STANDING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We need to realize what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of mainly two items: Christ as life and the genuine oneness. Christ as life is the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and oneness is the standing, the ground, of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Everything in the universe has a nature and a standing; nothing exists without a nature and a standing. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery exists by its nature and by its standing. We saw in the previous chapter that the church is nothing but Christ. Thus, Christ as life is the content, the nature, of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and the genuine oneness is the standing of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>The nature and standing of the church&mdash;Christ as life and the genuine oneness&mdash;are both lacking to the uttermost in today&rsquo;s Christianity. If our nature is not Christ as life and our standing is not the genuine oneness, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will become merely a continuation of Christianity. The difference between Christianity and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is that Christianity does not have Christ as its nature or the genuine oneness as its standing. Instead of Christ, Christianity has various things as its nature; it is an organization built upon certain concepts. Instead of genuine oneness, Christianity is full of divisions. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery, in contrast, has only one thing as its nature. Christ is the unique nature of the church. Because the church is composed entirely of Christ, Christ alone is the nature of the church. The standing, the ground, of the church is the genuine oneness. If we lose the genuine oneness, we are immediately no longer the church or the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Instead, we become a continuation of Christianity, having the same nature and standing as Christianity. This is a serious matter. To remain in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must keep these two things: Christ as life and the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT<br />
UNTIL WE ALL ARRIVE<br />
AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Now we will go on to see how to keep the oneness. Ephesians 4:3 says, &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.&rdquo; These two verses mention two kinds of oneness&mdash;the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith. We all have the oneness of the Spirit because we all have the Spirit. Therefore, what we need to do today is to keep the oneness of the Spirit until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p><h2 class="head2">The Oneness of the Spirit<br />
Being the Spirit Himself</h2>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit immediately entered into us. Because the same Spirit has entered into all the believers, the Spirit is our very oneness. All the lights in a room are one in the electricity; the electricity within them is their oneness. When electricity is gone, the lights are divided. When electricity is in the lights, they are one, yet they are not one in themselves but one in the electricity. Thus, the oneness of the lights is the oneness of the electricity. Likewise, our oneness is the oneness of the Spirit because we all have the same Spirit in us. The Spirit is our oneness. We need to keep this oneness until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Faith in Ephesians 4:13<br />
Being the Objective Faith</h2>
<p>According to the context, the faith mentioned in verse 13 does not refer to our subjective ability to believe but to the things in which we believe. The word <em>faith</em> in verse 13 refers to the Christian faith, composed of all the things in which we believe. The items that constitute the Christian faith are related to Christ&rsquo;s person and His redemptive work. These items are that God in Christ became a man, that this man, Jesus, died on the cross for our sins in order to redeem us, that He resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens to be our Savior, our Lord, and our life, and that He is coming again to receive us to Himself in His kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness Being Lost because of Concepts</h2>
<p>When we are saved, we become one with all other believers, for we all believe in the same items of the faith. However, we also bring things with us that are not items of the faith. Then as time progresses, we gradually pick up more things that are not items of the faith. For instance, four college students may be saved during a gospel campaign. Because the Spirit enters into all of them, they have the oneness of the Spirit. Furthermore, because they all believe in the same things, they have the same faith. However, one, a doctoral student, may have a peculiar concept that eventually becomes a great problem in the church life. Another one may decide to study theology. Therefore, he may enter a seminary and acquire many modernistic teachings. The third student may attend a Baptist church and become convinced that immersion by that church is the only proper form of baptism. The fourth student may be brought into the practice of speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>On the day the four students were saved, they were all one. However, if they come together some time later, they may argue with one another over their different concepts. The doctoral student will contend for his peculiar concept, the seminary student for his modernistic teachings, the Baptist for baptism by immersion, and the fourth student for speaking in tongues. Their oneness will be lost because they picked up various things other than the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith. The things they picked up, which are according to their preference and choice, are like toys to them. Although the first brother is a doctoral student, in the eyes of the Lord he is a young boy who likes the toy of his peculiar concept. The others also have their toys of modernistic teachings, baptism by immersion, and speaking in tongues. Because they are spiritual children, they love their toys.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:13-14 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching.&rdquo; All the teachings that are toys to the four students are winds that blow them away from the genuine oneness. If we are not careful, a wind of teaching may become a toy to us, just as some in the churches today have picked up the teaching that it is legalistic not to go to movie theaters and that it is religious to regularly attend the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings. This kind of teaching becomes a toy to some saints, and such toys become factors of division.</p>
<p>Although we have the oneness of the Spirit as soon as we are saved, we may pick up many other things as toys. Thankfully, however, as we go on with the Lord, we will grow and mature. When a child grows up, he eventually drops his childhood toys. A full-grown man does not have toys. As we are growing, on the one hand, we will pick up toys, but on the other hand, we will drop our toys so that we eventually arrive at the oneness of faith. At a certain stage of maturity in the Christian life, we will care only for the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith. No doctrines will be able to blow us away. Because young saints are more vulnerable to winds of teaching, my burden in this chapter is to inoculate them. We need to learn not to pick up any winds of teaching. Rather, we need to remember that the church is uniquely Christ, that the nature of the church is life, which is Christ, and that the standing of the church is the genuine oneness, which also is Christ. If any kind of doctrine comes to us, we should say, &ldquo;I do not care for this toy. I care only for Christ.&rdquo; Someone in the charismatic movement may ask us if we have experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit and may tell us how good it is to speak in tongues. This may become a wind of teaching that blows us away from the genuine oneness. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is full of division, but the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover us back to the genuine oneness.</p><h2 class="head1">CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECT</h2>
<p>Christianity today is made up of denominations, which are divisions, or sects. The word <em>denominate</em> means &ldquo;to give a name to.&rdquo; Any Christian group that has a particular name, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, or Episcopalian, is a division. Even a group that does not have a particular name yet insists on a special teaching is a sect. If a group does not insist on a particular teaching, but they practice a special fellowship that does not include all believers, they also are a sect. Some groups, for example, do not accept a brother into their circle unless he speaks in tongues. Any group that has a particular name, a particular teaching, or a particular fellowship is a division.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not have a particular name. We are simply the church, just as the moon is simply the moon. No matter where on earth the moon is viewed from, it is still only the moon, having no particular name. In Boston the church is simply the church in Boston. In New York City it is the church in New York City. We do not have a particular name because once we take a particular name, we become a sect. Nor do we have particular teachings. Many saints among us have spoken in tongues, and some probably still do. However, we are not a tongue-speaking church. Neither do we have a particular fellowship. As long as a man believes in the Lord and is saved, he is our brother. We are common in that we accept all genuine believers.</p>
<p>Some have tried to bring tongue-speaking into the church. However, if we become a tongue-speaking church, we will be a sect. Some believe in pretribulation rapture. To hold such a doctrine is not wrong, but if some preach this, insisting that the whole church hold this doctrine, it will lead to division. We are common and general for the sake of the oneness, but because other Christians are particular, they refuse to be one with us. Thus, the responsibility for division rests upon them. We need to learn not to be particular but to receive all kinds of genuine Christians in order to keep the oneness. Some Christians are willing to drop their particular teachings and concepts. When we came into the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we dropped our particular teachings and became common so that we could have the genuine oneness. If we are not common but particular, we will lose the oneness and become a sect, a division. We all need to see the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: How is the perfecting into one in John 17:23 related to our sanctification?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We are already in the genuine oneness, but only to a small degree. Therefore, we need to grow in life to be more sanctified and thereby more perfected. The more we are sanctified, the more we are perfected, and the more we are in the genuine oneness. As long as we have Christ&rsquo;s life in us, we are in the oneness. However, our degree of oneness is low if we have little growth in life. When we grow, we are more sanctified, more perfected, and therefore more in the genuine oneness.</p>
<p><em>Question: Recently, another brother and I did not have the same opinion on a certain issue. I said that I could drop what I felt and take his way, but he said that I needed to think the same thing as him to truly be one with him. When we are fully in the oneness, will we all think the same thing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Philippians 2:2 and 4:2 mention the matter of thinking the same thing, and 2:2 also mentions thinking the one thing. The same thing and the one thing are Christ. Suppose one brother wants to go to a movie, and a second brother wants to read the Word. For them to think the same thing does not mean that the second brother drops his concept and decides to go to the movie with the first brother, nor does it mean that the first brother drops his concept and decides to read the Word with the second. Rather, it means that both drop their concept and set their mind on Christ. Christ must be our thinking. We should not think about whether to go to a movie or read the Word. Instead, we should set our mind on Christ. If we set our mind on Christ, I doubt that He will ever direct us to go to a movie. He will probably direct us to read the Word.</p>
<p><em>Question: Sometimes, though not often, we meet Christians who want to have a general fellowship. They do not have any particular teaching or any particular fellowship, and they are willing to be one with us. However, they may consider being in the church as being synonymous with being under your ministry. One group I met is wary of being under anyone&rsquo;s ministry because they have been damaged by different teachers in the past. What can we say to these ones?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Ephesians 4:11-12 concerns the matter of ministry. These verses say, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Verse 11 lists several gifts, or gifted persons, but verse 12 mentions only one ministry. All the gifts are in one ministry. Second Corinthians 4:1 says, &ldquo;Having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart.&rdquo; This verse shows that although the apostles are many, their ministry is one. Peter, John, James, Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul all preached and taught only Christ and the church. They were many gifts, but they had one ministry.</p>
<p>To say that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is under one man&rsquo;s ministry is inaccurate. In the denominations some teach the doctrine of church leadership by the presbytery, some teach baptism by immersion, some teach speaking in tongues, some teach pretribulation rapture, some teach post-tribulation rapture, and some teach mid-tribulation rapture. They teach different things; therefore, they have different ministries. This causes much division. Among us we have only one ministry; it is not a certain man&rsquo;s ministry but <em>the</em> ministry. The unique New Testament ministry includes Paul, Peter, Watchman Nee, and me because we all teach the same thing&mdash;Christ and the church. If any brother is raised up by the Lord to minister, he also will minister only Christ and the church. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John each wrote concerning a different aspect of Christ, but this does not mean that they taught different things in the way that those in Christianity today teach. We do not desire to have any different ministries among us. We desire to have only the one unique ministry composed of many different gifted ones who all teach the same thing&mdash;Christ and the church. If we teach differently, our teaching will cause divisions.</p>
<p><em>Question: When we meet other Christians and simply try to enjoy Christ with them, it seems that divisive questions always come up, and it is difficult to be one with them. What should we do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is difficult to help such ones, because they are divisive. They may turn their backs upon us and say that we are divisive, but arguing leads nowhere. The burden in this chapter is to help us discern what the genuine oneness is so that we may be preserved in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not need to go out to convince all Christians to be one. No one can do this. Even the Lord Jesus does not do this; He allows the denominations to exist until He comes back (Rev. 2:18&mdash;3:6, 14-22). However, we need to seek to be approved by the Lord. First Corinthians 11:19 says, &ldquo;There must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.&rdquo; The parties mentioned in this verse are sects or divisions. We can be approved and manifested because the divisions exist. Thus, the divisions actually serve a purpose.</p>
<p><em>Question: Some saints on the college campuses have formed student clubs or organizations. Is this the proper standing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In some places it is necessary to form a club in order to be able to use a classroom for a Bible-study. That is all right. If possible, however, we should try to avoid forming a club. Instead, we should simply be Christians.</p>
<p>Christianity has existed for twenty centuries. Many good Christian evangelists have tried to find the best way to attract people to hear the gospel and be saved. However, history shows that only the genuine work, the work that is carried out by the Holy Spirit, remains.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 11:3a; Matt. 23:8, 10; 1 Pet. 5:3, 5; 1 Cor. 12:28; Acts 2:14; Gal. 2:9-12; Acts 15:13, 19; Heb. 13:17</h1>
<p>The previous two chapters concerned two basic truths&mdash;the church being Christ and the genuine oneness of the church. This chapter concerns a third basic truth in the New Testament that is somewhat deeper&mdash;the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church. The constitution of the church is the way in which the church is arranged. The headship of Christ is closely related to the constitution of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Headship of Christ<br />
Not Being Fully Established until<br />
the New Testament</h2>
<p>First, we need to see that the headship of Christ was not fully established in the Old Testament. Ephesians 1:20-22 states that when Christ ascended to the heavens, God gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This proves that before Christ&rsquo;s ascension, in the Old Testament time, the headship of Christ was not fully established. Of course, with God there is no element of time, but in God&rsquo;s administration there is the element of time. Before the New Testament age the headship of Christ was not complete, not fully established. It was in Christ&rsquo;s ascension that God inaugurated Him into the full headship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man Being Needed to Carry Out God&rsquo;s<br />
Eternal Purpose and to Deal with God&rsquo;s Enemy</h2>
<p>The headship of Christ was not fully established in the Old Testament because Christ was not yet incarnated. In the Old Testament times Christ was only the Son of God, not yet the Son of Man. This is very significant. For Christ to have the full headship, He needs two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Being God alone is not adequate for Him to be the Head. To be the Head, He needs to be both God and man. This matter is neglected by most Christian teachers. According to the human concept, being God is adequate for Christ to be the Head of the universe. However, according to God&rsquo;s economy, God will not exercise His judgment in His administration as God alone. Acts 17:31 says, &ldquo;He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God needs a man to exercise His judgment in His administration because His administration is very much related to dealing with Satan. The government, the police, and the law courts are established not for good men but for criminals. In a sense, if the subtle one, Satan, and all the evil spirits and demons did not exist, there would be no need for God to set up a governmental administration. God has a governmental administration in the universe mainly for two reasons. On the positive side, God needs an administration in order to carry out His eternal purpose. On the negative side, God needs a government to deal with His enemy and all the evil powers. Without man, God&rsquo;s eternal purpose could never be fulfilled, and His enemy could not be dealt with. Because God is the Creator and Satan is a creature, God would never lower His status to deal directly with Satan. Therefore, God needs man, another creature, to deal with Satan. In summary, man is needed to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. Hence, before Christ became a man, His headship could not be fully completed, fully established.</p>
<p>Christ as the Son of God alone was not qualified to be the Head over all things in God&rsquo;s governmental administration. He needed to be incarnated, to put on humanity. In incarnation Christ became no longer only the Son of God but also the Son of Man. He now has two elements, the divine element and the human element. In order to be the Head over all things in God&rsquo;s government, Christ needed to have divinity and humanity, and He needed to accomplish two things. To take care of God&rsquo;s two needs, Christ needed to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and defeat God&rsquo;s enemy. By dying on the cross, on the one hand, Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose, and on the other hand, He also defeated Satan and destroyed the power of death on the cross (Heb. 2:14). Therefore, Christ has accomplished everything. By incarnation He picked up the human element, and by being crucified He accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose and defeated and destroyed God&rsquo;s enemy. Because Christ gained the human element in His incarnation and accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose and defeated God&rsquo;s enemy in His crucifixion, He is now fully qualified to be the Head of the universe in God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion He rested for three days. A person rests after accomplishing something. After resting in the tomb for three days, Christ resurrected and then ascended into the heavens. In His ascension He was inaugurated into the full headship of the entire universe. In the third heavens Christ was given to be Head over all things to the church. Christ is also the head of every man (1 Cor. 11:3a). Thus, in His ascension Christ&rsquo;s headship was fully established.</p>
<p>All these truths are buried in the Bible. Many Christians today read the Bible but do not see the truth. No book sold in Christian bookstores today contains the truth that Christ&rsquo;s headship was not fully established until His ascension, because He needed to become a man and be crucified in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and to defeat and destroy God&rsquo;s enemy. This truth is in the Bible, yet if we do not have the light, we will not be able to see it. Because the human mentality can only know doctrine, we need heavenly light, vision, and revelation in order to see a vision of the truth. We need to repeat this truth again and again until our inner eyes are opened and we see it. Once Christ picked up humanity through incarnation and was crucified to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and defeat and destroy God&rsquo;s enemy, He was qualified both in element and in achievement to be the Head over all things. Thus, in His ascension God inaugurated Him into the universal headship over all things for God&rsquo;s administration. Today the headship of Christ is fully established.</p>
<p>The first preaching of the gospel by Peter in Acts 2 indicates the establishment of the headship of Christ. At the conclusion of his message Peter said, &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified&rdquo; (v. 36). This means that God has inaugurated Christ. Jesus was not a great man outwardly; rather, He was an unknown man from Nazareth, a small town in the despised region of Galilee. Such a lowly man was inaugurated into the universal headship over all things by God. We need to declare, &ldquo;There is a man in glory! There is a man on the throne in the third heaven! This man, Jesus, has been inaugurated as the Head over all things!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Through the twenty centuries of church history the matter of how the church should be organized has been a continual problem. The church does not consist of only one or two persons. On the day of Pentecost alone three thousand were saved and brought into the church (v. 41). Not long after, five thousand more were saved (4:4). It would be difficult even to know how to bring together only these eight thousand people. Eventually, there was not only a church in Jerusalem, but there were also churches in Samaria, Antioch, Asia Minor, and Europe. Furthermore, in the church there were not only believers but also apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11). There were also elders, deacons, and deaconesses. All these believers, churches, gifts, and serving ones had to be arranged, or organized, in some way.</p>
<p>Actually, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there should not be any organization in the church. The church is not an organization but an organism. A desk, which is an organization, consists of many pieces fitted together without any life. However, our physical body, which is an organism, was not organized but was born and grew into its present form. An organism with its many organic parts is altogether a matter of life. The word <em>organic</em> means &ldquo;of or related to life.&rdquo; An organism is an entity entirely of life. Nothing in our body is produced by organization. In contrast, in an organization nothing is living; every piece is dead. Everything in an organization is a human work arranged by human hands.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christianity is altogether an organization. Positions and offices in many denominations are decided by elections. Pastors today are often hired and fired. However, nothing in an organic body can be elected, hired, or fired. Our arms are not placed on our bodies by an election, nor can an old or weak arm be hired or fired. Elections, hiring, and firing are inorganic tools of human organization. There should be no elections, hiring, or firing in the church, because the church is altogether an organism. However, today&rsquo;s Christianity is full of elections, hiring, and firing because it is an organization.</p>
<p>The church is an organism, not an organization, yet there is surely the need of some arrangement among thousands of people who come together in various cities as local churches. Finding this arrangement and the proper way for all the affairs of the church to be carried out is a great problem. Most seminaries have a course concerning the organization of the church, but the concept of organization related to the church cannot be found in the New Testament. We need to see the basic principle that any kind of organization leads to a hierarchy and that any kind of hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Organization of the Catholic Church</h2>
<p>Let us first examine the organization of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is organized by first claiming that Peter was the unique representative and successor of Christ and thus the head of the church. The Catholic Church says that Peter became the first pope and that every succeeding pope has also been the head of the church. The office of the pope is an insult to the headship of Christ. The Catholic Church claims that because Peter is named first when the disciples or apostles are mentioned in the New Testament, he was Christ&rsquo;s representative and was the head of the church. It is true that in the four Gospels and Acts Peter&rsquo;s name is mentioned first, but at least one verse lists Peter second. Galatians 2:9 mentions &ldquo;James and Cephas and John.&rdquo; This verse shows that Peter was not always the first. Sometimes Peter was the first, but sometimes he was not. In Galatians 2:9 he became the second, and James became the first. Peter became second because he lost the boldness that he had on the day of Pentecost. In Acts 2 Peter did not care for his own life. He cared only for Christ and stood up in a threatening situation to take the lead to declare the gospel. However, in Galatians 2 he became afraid of only a few Jewish believers. Peter was eating with the Gentile believers, but according to verse 12, when some Jewish believers came, he became afraid and began to shrink back and separate himself from the Gentiles. This damaged the truth of the gospel (v. 14). The truth of the gospel in the New Testament economy is that the Gentile and the Jewish believers are one (1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27-28; Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:11). Because Peter became weak and did not uphold the truth, he lost the leadership.</p>
<p>Acts 15 also shows that Peter was not always in the lead. There was a conference among the apostles and the elders to fellowship concerning the matter of circumcision. In verses 7 through 11 Peter spoke based upon his experience, and then in verse 12 Paul spoke based upon his experiences, but no decision was made. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;When they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.&rdquo; In verse 19 James concludes, &ldquo;Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God.&rdquo; The final word in the conference was given not by Peter but by James. In human terms, James presided over the conference. This proves that by that time James was higher than Peter. Thus, Galatians 2:9 and Acts 15 nullify the entire structure of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Peter was never a unique, permanent, organizational, official, or positional leader. He was temporarily a leader according to his spiritual capacity. When he had the highest spiritual capacity, he was the leader. When he lost his spiritual capacity, he lost the leadership. This proves that the leadership among God&rsquo;s people is not official, organizational, positional, or permanent. Rather, it is always dependent on spiritual capacity. If a brother has the capacity, he should take the lead. If he does not have the capacity, another should take the lead.</p>
<p>The organization of the Catholic Church begins from parishes, or local assemblies, which have deacons and priests as their leaders. All the parishes in a certain region are part of a diocese, which is led by a bishop. Actually, the title <em>bishop</em> comes from the Greek word that means &ldquo;overseer.&rdquo; In the New Testament this term refers to an elder (1 Tim. 3:2; Acts 20:17, 28). Thus, according to the New Testament, <em>elder</em> and <em>bishop</em> are two terms denoting the same person. The word <em>presbyter</em> in Greek refers to one who is older and experienced and is translated as &ldquo;elder.&rdquo; The term <em>elder</em> denotes an elder&rsquo;s person, and the term <em>overseer</em> denotes an elder&rsquo;s function. In the second century Ignatius taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder, a presbyter. He taught that the elders oversee local assemblies and that the bishops oversee larger districts. The Catholic Church went further in this error by placing archbishops above the bishops, the cardinals above the archbishops, and the pope above the cardinals. This hierarchy with the pope as the head insults the headship of Christ. Because a hierarchy always has a head, any hierarchy in the church is an insult to the headship of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Organization of<br />
the Protestant Denominations<br />
and Free Groups</h2>
<p>The Protestant denominations are the same as the Catholic Church in principle; they are different only in scale. State churches have the head of government as the head of the church and are therefore an insult to the headship of Christ. The Church of England does not have a pope, but it has the king or queen of England as its head. Below the king or the queen are the archbishops, then the bishops, and so on. This is the same hierarchical structure found in the Catholic Church under the pope. Therefore, the whole Church of England also is an insult to the headship of Christ. Other state churches include the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, and the Church of Denmark.</p>
<p>There are also many private churches, such as the Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Lutheran churches. In principle these are the same as the Catholic and state churches&mdash;they have an organizational structure that leads to a head. Therefore, all the organizations in Christianity are insults to the headship of Christ. Free groups are not an exception. The difference is only in scale; the principle is the same.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Official, Permanent, Organizational, or Positional Leadership<br />
in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not have an official, permanent, organizational, or positional leader. The only leader in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is Christ. One day the mother of James and John, who was the aunt of Jesus, requested of Jesus, &ldquo;Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom&rdquo; (Matt. 20:21). She had two sons, and she knew that there would be two positions next to the Lord in His kingdom. However, the Lord told James and John, &ldquo;My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father&rdquo; (v. 23). Then the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (vv. 25-27).</p>
<p>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord told His disciples, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; This verse is the source of the name of the Brethren assemblies. In the early days the Brethren were absolutely right. Because they saw the error of organization in the church, they dropped all organization. They do not consider that they have any leader; they are all only brothers.</p>
<p>Although Peter was the leader for a time, he was not a leader officially, permanently, organizationally, or positionally. He was a leader only instantly, temporarily, and according to his spiritual capacity at a particular time. Because he had the highest spiritual capacity on the day of Pentecost, he certainly should have been the leader. However, because the leadership was not official, permanent, organizational, or positional, another one rose up when Peter&rsquo;s spiritual capacity waned and he became weak. James became the leader at that time. This is strong proof that among God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age there is no official, permanent, organizational, or positional leadership.</p>
<p>The case of Paul and Barnabas also proves that the leadership in the New Testament is not permanent. When the Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Saul in Acts 13:2, Barnabas took the lead. When they were on their evangelical journey, however, Paul suddenly became the leading one (v. 9). This case also proves that the leadership among the apostles was not official or permanent but temporary and according to the spiritual capacity.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God ordained that there be only one king among His people. However, in the New Testament there is always more than one elder in a church (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). The plurality of the eldership is very significant. The New Testament also shows that there is never one elder who is first among the other elders. If there were only one elder, he would surely be the leader, but because there are always several elders, it is difficult to say who the leader is. Any definite, positional, official, or permanent leader is an insult to the headship of Christ because in the New Testament economy God regards the headship of Christ to the uttermost. In the entire universe there is only one unique Head. Therefore, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there is no permanent, official, or positional leadership among God&rsquo;s people today. It is God&rsquo;s wisdom to have not one elder in a church but a number of elders.</p>
<p>Some may wonder how the eldership can be practiced if no elder is ranked first. The cases of Peter, James, Barnabas, and Paul show that all the elders have the same status, but at a certain time or in a certain matter one may have a higher capacity than the others and will therefore take the lead. At another time or in another matter a different brother may have the greatest capacity; hence, he will be the leader at that time. Through the plurality of the eldership, there is no definite leader, and the absolute headship of Christ is regarded, preserved, and respected.</p>
<p>According to the human concept, our bodies are arranged in such a way that the shoulder is the head of the arm, the arm is the head of the hand, and the hand is the head of the fingers. Thus, our concept is that a body has many heads. However, according to medical science, there is only one head, and it gives orders directly to every member of the body. The head gives orders to the fingers in the same way that it gives orders to the arms. The shoulder, the arm, the hand, and the fingers are all equal in receiving orders directly from the head. This thought nullifies our human mentality. Paul, the greatest apostle, received orders directly from Christ the Head, and we, the smallest members, also receive orders directly from Christ the Head. This honors the Head. The headship of Christ does not allow for there to be any other heads or subheads. Any other head is an insult to Christ. Therefore, in the church there is no head other than Christ. Our physical body has many members but only one head. If one brother is a shoulder in the Body of Christ and another brother is a little finger, the first brother should say to the second, &ldquo;Do not exalt me. I have the same standing as you. You are not the head, and neither am I. You receive orders directly from the Head, and I do too.&rdquo; In Christianity today and even among some of the local churches this truth has been almost completely lost. We know how to receive orders from higher brothers, but we do not know how to receive orders directly from our Head. This is wrong.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Being Constituted<br />
with Christ as Life and<br />
with Christ as the Unique Head</h2>
<p>The church is constituted absolutely not according to the human mentality or worldly organizational methods but with Christ as life and with Christ as the unique Head. In the church, the Body of Christ, there is no other head. Regardless of his or her location or function, every member is related directly to the Head; every member has the same standing. There are no intermediary members, contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church that the so-called holy mother mediates between the believers and Jesus. We all know that this teaching of the Catholic Church is wrong, but in our actual practice we may consider that certain persons are intermediaries between us and the Lord.</p>
<p>We need to be cautious of this hidden error. On the one hand, we must never be an intermediary between God&rsquo;s people and the Lord Himself. We need to allow the Lord&rsquo;s people to receive orders directly from the Lord. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, in all the times saints have come to me for fellowship throughout the years, I have never given them a decision, an order, or a commandment. Instead, I always tell them, &ldquo;You need to go to the Lord. Pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading directly.&rdquo; On the other hand, we must never take someone else as an intermediary between us and the Lord. Because most believers are weak, they prefer to depend upon others rather than going directly to the Lord. Some say, &ldquo;How good it is to have a spiritual brother among us. We can rely on him; he will tell us what to do and what not to do.&rdquo; This is terrible; it is according to the Catholic concept that the believers are too low to contact the Lord directly and that they need to pray to Mary so that she will contact Jesus for them. We do not like this teaching, but we may practice it in principle. This teaching is heretical. The worship of Mary is the greatest blasphemy to Christ&rsquo;s headship. Regrettably, something has secretly crept in among us to cause some members to become intermediaries between the saints and the Lord. We need to be cautious of this.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, since the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us over fifty years ago, the Lord has shown us the truth that every member is related directly to the Head. Brother Watchman Nee was the first to practice being careful not to come between any member and the Head. He was very cautious in this matter. I was with him for many years and saw many cases. He never told anyone what to do or what not to do. Many of us begged him to tell us what to do, but he would never say a word. He made it clear that he was not the head or the leader but only a brother with a burden to minister God&rsquo;s word to His people. When we were with him in mainland China, no one knew who would be the leader. How shameful it is that some among us today claim to be the leader or the future leader! The fact that many saints accepted such claims indicates that we do not know or practice the truth. My burden at this time is to share with all the young saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery concerning the constitution of the church. In order for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be strong and in a good order today, we must be clear about the constitution of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Leader or Head<br />
in a Local Church or in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>The constitution of the church is according to the fact that Christ is the unique Head. There is no other leader. Regardless of how great our gift or our commission from the Lord is, we are all only members, not leaders. No one among us should accept anyone as an official, unique, or permanent leader. In carrying things out, there is the need for leadership. The Bible shows that on the day of Pentecost there was the need for someone to rise up to declare the gospel to the people. Peter took the lead to meet this need, but he was not an official, permanent, organizational, or positional leader. His leadership was instant and depended on his present spiritual capacity. At that time Peter had the greatest capacity; therefore, he spontaneously took the lead to carry out that ministry. However, when he later became weak, another one was raised up to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. The leadership in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today must be the same. According to my portion from the Lord, I currently share in the leadership, but this does not mean that I am an official or permanent leader. Perhaps in a year someone may have more capacity in a certain matter. At that time and in that matter that person will take the lead to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. By practicing in this way, we will have no official or permanent leader among us. We have only one Leader&mdash;Christ. The plurality of the eldership and the apostles prevents any human leadership that would insult the headship of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">All the Local Churches Being Equal</h2>
<p>Not only are all the members equal, but also all the local churches are equal, regardless of their size. The church that has the most members is not the head church. Regardless of how small a local church may be, it has the same status as the biggest church. There are no &ldquo;parent&rdquo; or &ldquo;children&rdquo; churches. All the churches have the same standing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Churches Not Being Organized into One Unit</h2>
<p>The churches should not be organized into one unit. In other words, they should not be united in one organization. If this occurs, the churches will immediately become an organization and form a hierarchy with a leader at the top, which will insult the headship of Christ. In each local church there is no head, and among all the churches there is no organization, for this would lead to a hierarchy with a head. Any kind of organization with a head would insult the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Different Regions of the Work<br />
Being on the Same Level<br />
and Not Being Organized into One</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there are different regions of the work. For instance, Peter worked among the Jews, and Paul worked in the Gentile world. These were two different regions of the work. The New Testament shows that all the regions of the work have the same standing. Many Bible students have tried to discover whether Peter&rsquo;s work or Paul&rsquo;s work was higher, but no one can tell because there is no organization or rank in the Lord&rsquo;s work. The apostles&rsquo; work among the Jews and the Gentiles was never organized into one work. It is appealing on a human level to merge two regions of work into one, but such a merger would result in a hierarchy. Therefore, there is no such merger in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize, in every local church there is not a head; rather, there are several elders with no permanent leader. Among the churches there is no organization, for this would lead to a hierarchy with a head other than Christ. Finally, among the regions of the work there is no merged work, which also would lead to a hierarchy and produce a head other than Christ. Among God&rsquo;s people there is only one Head&mdash;Christ. This constitution keeps all the saints, all the churches, and all the regions of the work in direct contact with the Lord. Thus, there is no need of any kind of intermediary. This is the spiritual way, the way of life that keeps every believer, local church, and region of the work in life and without any organization or human leadership.</p>
<p>That there is no organization or human leadership in a local church does not mean that there are no leading ones in a local church. The elders are the leading ones. Hebrews 13:17 says, &ldquo;Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.&rdquo; Notice that this verse does not say that the saints should obey the one leader. Besides the elders, among the churches there are the apostles. In the New Testament, when functioning in their capacity, the apostles have the position to say a word according to God&rsquo;s economy to the churches, and the churches need to listen to their word. On the one hand, there is no leadership in the church; on the other hand, there are leading ones in the local churches whom the saints need to obey, and there are apostles among the churches whose word, which is according to God&rsquo;s economy, the churches need to receive. This keeps the churches locally and universally in a good order. This is the constitution of the church that respects the headship of Christ to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: If an elder in a church decides to lead the saints into something that some do not feel is the Lord&rsquo;s leading, perhaps something worldly, what should the saints do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Every local church has more than one elder. It is easy for one person to be misled in any matter, but it is not easy for a few to be misled together. If at least three or four elders pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading in a matter, they will not be misled. In every local church the saints should obey the leading ones (Heb. 13:17).</p>
<p><em>Question: If I go to the Lord and pray about something but do not get an answer, should I go to the elders?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We all need to have direct contact with the Lord to receive a word directly from the Lord. This is the basic principle that we all must practice. However, it is often difficult to become clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s leading when we pray by ourselves. Therefore, we need to fellowship with other members in the church, including the elders.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:1-2; 1 Tim. 3:15; 1:3-6; Gal. 2:11-14</h1>
<p>In his first Epistle to Timothy the apostle Paul wrote, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God&rdquo; (3:15). Timothy needed some instruction to know how to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church. We too need such instruction today. We may think that the church is simply the coming together of the saints with some leading ones and the carrying out of some services. However, the truth concerning the church is not so shallow or simple. If it were, Paul would not have needed to instruct Timothy concerning how to conduct himself in the church life. The burden in this chapter is for us to see how to conduct ourselves in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HONORING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Case of Peter</h2>
<p>Based on my own learning and experience, I would say that to know how to conduct ourselves in the church, we first need to see the headship of Christ. The entire New Testament unveils that today God has ordained in His economy that we respect, regard, and exalt the headship of Christ to the uttermost in everything. Matthew 1 through Revelation 22 reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is that no head other than Christ should exist among God&rsquo;s people. In the Old Testament there was a series of kings; there was no unique head. In the New Testament, however, there are no heads other than Christ. It is true that Peter is always listed first in the four Gospels among the twelve disciples, but the Lord Jesus never said that Peter was the highest disciple. The Lord never gave even a hint to indicate that anyone was first. He did not establish a leadership with Peter. Rather, the Lord always placed Peter in difficult situations. In his natural man Peter desired to take the lead. In John 21 he threw himself into the sea to be the first to meet the Lord on the shore, but he was shamed by the Lord (vv. 7, 15-17). Peter also was the first of the disciples to speak on the Mount of Transfiguration, but he was stopped by God (Matt. 17:4-5). The four Gospels show no sign that the Lord had any intention to establish Peter as the leader among the apostles.</p>
<p>In Mark 16 when the angel sent the sisters to tell the disciples of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the angel particularly added the phrase <em>and Peter</em> (v. 7). Some may think that the phrase <em>and Peter</em> indicates that Peter was first among the apostles, but this is not the meaning. <em>And Peter</em> was added because Peter had a complete failure when he denied the Lord. Rather than being first in something positive, Peter was first in denying the Lord. No one denied the Lord as many times or as seriously as Peter did. Peter denied the Lord to such an extent that he probably did not have any confidence to come back to the Lord. Therefore, the Lord added the phrase <em>and Peter</em> so that Peter would know that the Lord would never forget him but had forgiven him already and was waiting for him to return.</p>
<p>There is no indication in the four Gospels that Peter was appointed to be first among the apostles. On the day of Pentecost Peter took the lead to stand with the eleven and speak a message to the Jews (Acts 2:14). At that time Peter was certainly the leader, but he was not an official, permanent, organizational, or positional leader. Rather, he was a leader temporarily according to his spiritual capacity at that time. Later, Peter became weak, not in a small matter but in a great matter. Paul said that Peter was not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel (Gal. 2:14). Peter, who was a Jew, ate with the Gentile believers. This was against the law of Moses, but it was according to the truth of the gospel. However, when some Jewish believers came to Antioch, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles (v. 12). This shows Peter&rsquo;s weakness. This weakness was not a small thing but a great thing that damaged the truth of the gospel. This shows that at that time Peter was no longer a spiritual lion but had become a spiritual chicken. Therefore, he was no longer the leading apostle. The Bible records that James had become the leading apostle (vv. 9, 12).</p>
<p>Suppose that there are five elders in a certain locality today. One may always take the lead. If this leading one becomes weak to the extent that he damages the truth of the gospel, the other brothers may not have the boldness to allow another one to take the lead. However, the record of the Holy Spirit in the Bible has the boldness. As soon as Peter became weak, the record of the Bible recognizes another one as the leader. There is no indication before this in the New Testament that James was spiritually strong. I do not know why James was the one to replace Peter, but according to Acts 15:13-21, as soon as Peter became weak, James rose up to take the lead. The point here is that there is no official or permanent leader in the New Testament. God does not desire that there be an official or permanent leader among His people in the New Testament age, because such a leader would be an insult to the headship of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Unique Leader</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 23:8-12 indicates that we should not have any leader. Today in the New Testament age there is only one unique Leader, that is, Christ. The headship is assigned solely to Christ; only He has the headship (Eph. 1:10, 22; Col. 2:10; 1 Cor. 11:3). This point has been fully missed by today&rsquo;s Christianity. Christ&rsquo;s headship has been insulted by organized Christianity, not only today but even since the second century. The entire organization of Christianity, both in the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches, is a complete insult to the headship of Christ. No group or denomination in Christianity today has the proper regard for the headship of Christ. Rather, they are concerned only for their organizations, all of which have a human leader.</p>
<p>According to the concept of most believers, including those in the local churches, any time a group of believers comes together to meet, they immediately wonder who will take the lead. There are some practices in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that have partly transformed our concept, but much of our old concept remains. Allow me to illustrate. When I was young, my family met in a denomination. When we went to church gatherings, we had the concept that there were specific leaders. When we entered into the church building, we would wait for the leader to arrive. We did not have any feeling of responsibility for the meeting. The mentality of almost all believers is filled with the thought that we have definite leaders. In contrast, it seems that whenever we come together in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, everyone is a leader, for all can call a hymn, offer a prayer, or share a testimony. The saints do not wait for a leader to come and direct the meetings. However, our practice is still not up to the standard. There remains within us a concept that certain ones are leaders. For practicality and coordination the elders often sit in the first row in the meetings. However, this does not mean that they are official leaders in the meetings. Indeed, in some meetings the elders sit in the back.</p>
<p>We need to realize that in the New Testament age God does not intend for His people to have any official, permanent, organizational, or positional leaders. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 23:8-11 is clear. He said, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers...Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ. And the greatest among you shall be your servant.&rdquo; There is no thought of any human leadership in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, because the headship of Christ should be uniquely respected and regarded. Nevertheless, the actual situation among Christians today is exactly the opposite. Even the mentality among the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has not been thoroughly purified concerning the matter of leadership. However, no one should take this word as a basis for rebellion. Human leadership is not right, but neither is rebellion. On one hand, God has ordained that His people be in a proper order, but on the other hand, God does not desire that there be any kind of official, permanent, organizational, or positional leadership.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Elders Being Not Lords but Patterns</h2>
<p>Peter, who was the leading apostle and the leading elder in Jerusalem for some time, wrote to the elders, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:3). The elders are not lords; rather, they are patterns. According to the natural human mentality, in any organization or group the leaders are in a position above others and give orders. If a restroom needs to be cleaned, a leader in worldly society customarily gives an order for someone to clean the restroom. However, in the church the elders should be the first to clean the restroom in order to establish a pattern, an example. It is the elders&rsquo; responsibility to be the first to carry out a service, and all the other saints simply need to follow. However, this is not the practice among many churches today. Regrettably, in many churches the elders are lords over God&rsquo;s flock. This is wrong. The elders should not be in a position over the saints. Rather, the elders should be under the saints, serving them. The elders should not lord it over the saints but should establish an example. This God-ordained concept that is found in the Bible is beyond our human mentality. The kind of leadership that is according to our human mentality is not found in the Bible. The Lord said, &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-27). Among us there is only one Leader, that is, Christ. We are all slaves.</p><h2 class="head2">Paul Ranking the Function of the Deacons<br />
before the Function of the Elders</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; <em>Helps</em> refers to the services of the deacons, and <em>administrations</em> refers to the functions of the elders. In this verse the apostle Paul listed the functions of the elders after the services of the deacons. When this Epistle was written, the church in Corinth was entirely in a situation of disorder. In such a situation the elders in Corinth may have esteemed themselves too highly, and Paul may have therefore purposely listed the functions of the elders after the services of the deacons in order to bring down the elders&rsquo; estimation of themselves. Paul intentionally placed things in a healthy and helpful order. Our concept is that the administrations of elders are higher than the helps of deacons. However, Paul&rsquo;s concept was that the helps are higher than the administrations. We need to recognize that there is no human leadership in the New Testament economy. On the other hand, God has ordained that there be a decent order among His people. Therefore, we need to learn how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. We must see the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church to know how to conduct ourselves in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Saints Being<br />
the Principal Persons in the Church</h2>
<p>Philippians 1:1 says, &ldquo;Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.&rdquo; This verse addresses not the saints <em>and</em> the overseers and deacons but the saints <em>with</em> the overseers and deacons. The word <em>with</em> is very significant, for it reveals that the major group of persons in the church are not the elders and the deacons but all the saints. According to our natural concept, we usually consider the most important group of persons in a local church to be first the overseers, then the deacons, and finally the saints. Paul&rsquo;s careful listing of all the saints first and his use of the word <em>with</em> are very meaningful. He did not write this in a careless way. This verse indicates that the saints, not the overseers and deacons, are the principal persons in the church. In God&rsquo;s consideration in the New Testament economy there is no human leadership. The headship belongs only to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Careful Not to Insult<br />
the Headship of Christ</h2>
<p>In order to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God, we first must be careful not to insult the headship of Christ in anything we do. Suppose a brother does not make decisions for himself and instead prefers to depend on an elder to make decisions for him. In a sense, it is good that a young believer who is unlearned and inexperienced would not trust in himself but would seek help from an elder. In another sense, this is not good, because no believer is a leader with the authority to make decisions for another believer. The unique Leader is the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>In this situation, because the younger brother is inexperienced, the responsibility to know and apply this principle does not fall mainly upon him but upon the elder. The elder should immediately begin to instruct him and establish him, saying, &ldquo;Brother, I can render some help to you, but you must know that I am not the Lord. I have no right to make any decision for you. The Lord Jesus is your Lord and my Lord also. You must learn how to exercise your spirit. Yes, you are a new believer, but the Lord Jesus is in you as the Spirit. Do not ask me whether or not you should go to see a movie. Instead, you should ask the Lord in prayer.&rdquo; In this way both brothers will respect the headship of Christ. If an elder makes a decision for a new believer, regardless of whether the elder does it with a good heart or with a critical attitude, he insults Christ&rsquo;s headship. Many brothers often unconsciously insult the headship of Christ. It is a serious thing for an elder to become the lord by telling a saint what to do. We must properly conduct ourselves in the house of God by helping our fellow believers in a way that honors the headship of Christ and by encouraging the dear younger ones to learn how to contact the Lord. This will make a great difference.</p>
<p>The situation in Christianity today is poor. Most in the Catholic Church seek guidance only from priests; they do not know the Lord. Obeying the instructions of a priest without contacting the Lord is a great insult to Christ&rsquo;s headship. I was never a Catholic, but I visited several Catholic cathedrals to study the situation. I realized that the whole of Catholicism with all its practices is a great insult to the headship of Christ. Most Catholics are never helped to know Christ in a living and direct way. Even when they pray, they do so under human direction. They are instructed to repeat certain prayers a certain number of times in front of the image of a certain saint, and they are told that this will reduce a relative&rsquo;s time in purgatory. This is not only superstition but also an insult to the headship of Christ. Our Lord is living, and He is the only Head. We need to bring people to Him. Even in the churches we have often overstepped and insulted the headship of Christ. We are not the Head or the Lord. We should not make any decision for anyone. We should instead usher them to the Lord so that they can receive a decision directly from Him. By doing so, they honor the Lord and respect the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>In his instruction in the Epistles to Timothy, Paul was always careful to respect the headship of Christ. Paul did not overstep in this matter. Christ is the unique Lord and Head. In order to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God, the first principle that we must keep is to honor the headship of Christ. It is crucial that we not overstep or do anything to insult the headship of Christ. If all the elders practice this, the saints will be forced to contact the Lord directly. Regardless of how many times a brother may ask me, I would never make a decision for him. Neither will I teach him how to make decisions for himself. Rather, I will instruct him to pray to contact the Lord directly. We need to contact the Lord again and again until He tells us His decision for us. If we practice this, we will have a healthy Christian life. Regardless of how young or old we are, we all need to learn to contact the Lord in order to have a healthy Christian life. The totality of all the saints living a healthy Christian life will be a healthy church life.</p><h2 class="head1">BEARING THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Pillar<br />
and Base of the Truth</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The pillar and base of the truth is the entire church, including all the saints, not only the elders and leading ones. In ancient times buildings were supported by pillars or columns, each of which rested on a base. Paul referred to this architectural feature to illustrate that the church is the pillar and base to bear the truth. Most of the saints probably do not have a deep sensation that they are responsible to bear the truth. I hope that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in this chapter will impress us that all the believers together are the pillar and base to bear the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Paul Being an Example of Bearing the Truth</h2>
<p>To understand what it means to bear the truth, we may consider the example of Paul in Galatians 2:11-14. Peter&rsquo;s shrinking back from eating with the Gentiles was contrary to the truth of the gospel, and Paul saw this. We need to remember that when Peter was the leading apostle, Paul was a young persecutor of the church. Compared to Peter, Paul was a young apostle. However, Paul saw that Peter did something contrary to the truth. Perhaps if we had been in Paul&rsquo;s place, we would not have rebuked Peter. We might have instead said to ourselves, &ldquo;I know that Peter is wrong, but he is older, more experienced, and more qualified than me. I dare not do or say anything.&rdquo; Paul, however, wrote, &ldquo;When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned&rdquo; (v. 11). Paul rebuked Peter, for although Peter was older and more experienced, at that instant Peter was doing something that was not according to the truth. Paul was thus bearing the truth; he was a pillar and base of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Member Being Responsible<br />
to Bear the Truth</h2>
<p>Paul was an apostle, but the Bible does not say that the apostles are the pillar and base of the truth. Rather, the Bible reveals that the church, which includes every believer, must bear the truth. If every saint does not bear the truth, the church will not be strong but will merely be a group of people who do not know and practice the truth but leave everything to the elders. This is a poor church. The United States is a strong nation because all the citizens bear the responsibility of upholding the Constitution. Even the president cannot violate the Constitution. If he does, he will be removed from office. In many other countries no one can touch the leader. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to be like the United States in that all the saints need to bear the responsibility of upholding the truth. The people of the United States should respect the presidency and the president, but if the president violates the Constitution, the people need to exercise their right to uphold the Constitution. Likewise, the saints in the churches need to respect the eldership and the leading ones, but if the leading ones do something contrary to the truth, the saints should be responsible to uphold the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Meetings Being<br />
for the Saints&rsquo; Instruction and Edification</h2>
<p>The church, which is the pillar and base of the truth, includes all the brothers and sisters. The sisters should not excuse themselves from knowing the truth simply because they are sisters. We should not come to the meetings only to shout and sing to have a good time. Merely to have a good time is not profitable. We need to practice to know the truth. If a student attends a university only to have a good time, after four years the student will go home with nothing. The best universities give the students a difficult time, not a good time. The church life is not for us to have a good time. The church is not a nightclub; it is the kingdom of God and the house of God. There is the need of some discipline. To be a citizen of a country or even a member of a family, one must learn and be disciplined. We need to practice to know the truth. When we come to the meetings, it is wonderful to have some pleasant singing and praising if the Lord leads. However, we should not go to the meetings mainly to have a good time but to receive some discipline and be instructed and edified.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Saint Needing to Discern<br />
When Anyone Speaks in a Church Meeting</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the church in ancient times met in a solid way, in a way to edify and instruct the saints. First Corinthians 14:29 says, &ldquo;As to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.&rdquo; If we came together only to have a good time, we would not need to do anything. However, because we come together to learn and to minister to one another, we must be sober and exercise our discernment. While a brother is speaking, all the saints need to discern whether or not he is speaking according to the truth. If what he speaks is not according to the truth, every saint should be ready to stand up and say something to uphold the truth. The saints should also be prepared to ask the elders to stop someone from speaking anything that is not according to the truth. Regardless of who is speaking, we must discern whether or not what is being spoken is according to the truth. We should never blindly trust that a person is speaking according to the truth. We should not care for the person but for the truth. The United States is a strong country because the Constitution is regarded more highly than any person. If someone even as high as the president violates the Constitution, he will be stopped. Likewise, in order for the church to be strong, every brother and sister must know the truth. I hope that if I were to say something contrary to the truth, even the young sisters would be prepared to stand up and exhort me in a proper way to stop.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning and Practicing the Truth</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul refers to &ldquo;the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; We are each a living member of the church with the living God in us. The church being the pillar and base of the truth implies that every member of the church should know the truth. We need to make a decision to learn the truth. If the young saints do not make such a decision, the church has no future. For the sake of the spreading of the church to new localities, there is a need of leading ones, some who can bear responsibility. We are short of such ones because in the daily church life we do not learn or practice the truth. If we learn the truth and practice the truth in the daily church life, every member will be able to bear some responsibility. Then wherever we spread, there will be no problems; every local church will be strong.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to know how to conduct ourselves in the church life as the house of God, we need to be careful to always do two things: never insult the headship of Christ and always learn, guard, and bear the truth. The headship of Christ and the truth are two basic factors that direct, control, and safeguard the church life. We need to honor, respect, and not insult the headship of Christ, not overstepping in any matter related to Christ&rsquo;s headship. We also need to learn and practice the truth. If we do these two things, we will be clear regarding how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Do the sisters have the same responsibility to bear the truth as the brothers?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To illustrate, in ordinary times the wife should follow the husband. However, if a thief breaks in or the house is on fire, a wife should not wait for her husband&rsquo;s permission to call for help. That is being too legal. For a sister to act in urgent situations is not overstepping. If someone stands up in a meeting and speaks something heretical, no one should hesitate. Everyone, including the youngest sister, should rise up to reject such speaking. If every saint is able to bear the truth in this way, it proves that the church is strong.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can the young ones see the light in the Word when they read the Bible? I feel that even if I read the Bible hundreds of times, I would never receive the kind of light that has been opened up in these messages.</em></p>
<p>Answer: The main purpose of spending time in the Word is not to understand it but to come into the presence of God, His breathing, and to be washed. To go further and see the light in the Word requires much labor in the Word. For instance, two years ago I was clear that God does not want any permanent, official, or organizational leadership in His church, but I had not yet gathered the verses to prove this point. In the past two years I gathered verses such as Matthew 23:8-12, 1 Peter 5:3, and 1 Corinthians 12:28, and examples such as Peter&rsquo;s case and Paul&rsquo;s case. Such study takes time. The New Testament mentions a category of workers called teachers (Acts 13:1; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11). To be a teacher requires much time. Furthermore, the church is the house of God. Every local church is a family with people of all ages. The young ones will gradually come to know more things, not by waiting passively but by contacting the Lord and the Word. As we gradually accumulate knowledge of the Bible, the light will come to us from the accumulated truth in our being.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have heard some say that we should all &ldquo;stay in one boat&rdquo; whether we are right or wrong, that if we &ldquo;go over a cliff,&rdquo; at least we will be one, that we should not disturb the oneness even if we sense an objection within, and that we should simply go along and trust that the Lord will bless the oneness and bring us through somehow. What do you think about this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Such talk is childish, foolish, superficial, and altogether illogical. We need to have a logical church life. No other book is as logical as the Bible. Every truth is logical. We should not accept such foolish, superficial talk. We need to learn the truth so that we can discern such speaking. We should not be rebellious or disobedient or cause trouble or turmoil, but our obedience must be based upon the proper knowledge of the logical truth. If someone stands up in a meeting and speaks something blasphemous or heretical, we should not be deceived to think that if we &ldquo;stay in the boat to keep the oneness,&rdquo; everything will turn out all right.</p>
<p>Some have said in recent years that the saints should not have any discernment and that to discern is not to love. However, 1 Corinthians 14:29 says that we should discern. Philippians 1:9 says, &ldquo;This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all discernment.&rdquo; Love should abound in discernment, not in foolishness. We need to love soberly, not blindly. The proper love is in full knowledge and all discernment.</p>
<p>I do not mean that the saints should rebel against the church or the elders. On one hand, God does not ordain any official, permanent, organizational, or positional leadership in His New Testament economy. On the other hand, Hebrews 13:17 says, &ldquo;Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.&rdquo; First Peter 5:5 says, &ldquo;Younger men, be subject to elders.&rdquo; Every truth has two sides. We need to hold both sides of every truth in order to be balanced. One side of the truth is that every member is responsible to know and practice the truth; the other side is that we also need to learn to know and subdue our flesh to be humbled and submit to others.</p>
<p><em>Question: Could you explain the meaning of the word</em> truth <em>in 1 Timothy 3:15?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The word <em>truth</em> means something that is real. In the Bible the word <em>truth</em> refers to God Himself, for only God is real. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in 1 Timothy 3:15 is the same word rendered &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in John 1:17, which says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse indicates that when Jesus came, grace came; that is, God came to be our enjoyment. When Jesus came, reality also came; that is, God came to be the reality. Thus, all the truths in the Bible refer to God Himself. However, some items in the Bible are not truths but are mere doctrines. Most Christians consider the doctrines in the Bible to be truths, but there is a difference.</p>
<p>Let us consider some examples in order to see the difference between truth and doctrines. The teachers among the Brethren studied many doctrines concerning the Lord&rsquo;s table. They studied the proper time to have the Lord&rsquo;s table. This is a doctrine, not a reality. They also studied what kind of cup and bread to serve, the way in which the elements should be distributed, and who has the right to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table. All these matters are doctrines, not the reality. However, there is also the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table. The truth is that Christ is the Head and the church is the Body. The death of Christ is displayed at the table because the wine, signifying the Lord&rsquo;s blood, is separate from the bread, signifying the Lord&rsquo;s body. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection also is displayed because there is one loaf on the table made from many grains, signifying the believers, who were produced in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). Christ as the Head, the church as the Body, and the death and resurrection of Christ are not doctrines but the truth.</p>
<p>Another example of the difference between doctrine and truth can be seen in the matter of baptism. Many Christian teachers study doctrines concerning the outward forms of baptism, such as what kind of water to use, what temperature of water to use, what name or names to baptize people into, the number of times to immerse a person, and the direction in which to immerse a person into the water. These matters are all doctrines, which are not very important. The truth of baptism is the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The church does not bear doctrines; it bears the truth. That God is the unique God is a truth, a reality, not a doctrine. All the truths in the Bible refer to God Himself directly or indirectly by referring to items such as Christ, the Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, or Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. These are the factors of the truth. The church bears only the truth.</p>
<p><em>Question: How is the church safeguarded from confusion?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The church should be the safeguard by bearing the truth. However, the churches today are lacking in the truth and are therefore weak. The shortage of every member learning and practicing the truth is the reason that the churches suffer from turmoil. If the churches are strong and full of the truth, we will be safeguarded. Turmoils are proof that the churches are weak and lacking in the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-6; 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 6:3; 2 Tim. 2:15; 4:3-4; 3:16-17</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider the matter of how to conduct oneself in the house of God. The two Epistles to Timothy were written when the church was in degradation, and it was because of the degradation that these two Epistles were written. What Paul ministered to Timothy was entirely concerning how to conduct himself in the church in a time of degradation. In the previous chapter we covered mainly two points concerning how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. First, we saw that we must respect the headship of Christ. Whatever we are, do, and say should be in a spirit that respects the headship of Christ. Respecting the headship of Christ safeguards us from many kinds of mistakes in the church life. The headship of Christ is crucial to our church life. The main problem with Christianity today is that it disregards the headship of Christ. In the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the first thing that we need to take care of is to regard the headship of Christ. The second matter we saw in the previous chapter is that the entire church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). Not the leading ones only but every member in the church should practice to know the truth so that we can be a pillar to bear God&rsquo;s truth in this dark age. Respecting the headship of Christ and bearing the truth are two governing principles we must follow in order to know how to conduct ourselves in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TEACHING ANYTHING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see a few more items that should govern our conduct in the church life. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul wrote, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith.&rdquo; We should not teach anything that is different from God&rsquo;s economy. The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized Greek word, denoting a dispensation, a stewardship, or an administration to dispense something. According to the revelation of the New Testament, God has an economy to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people to produce the church, the Body of Christ. The New Testament charges us not to teach anything other than God&rsquo;s economy. In the church life we should not teach anything that produces questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, regardless of how scriptural our teaching may be.</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter we saw that even the youngest believer needs to be bold to discern different speakings according to the truth. However, this does not mean that when a person speaks something that is not heretical or damaging to God&rsquo;s economy, we need to boldly stand up to say something against it. This will only cause trouble. Suppose a brother says, &ldquo;I do not like to see all the sisters with long hair. I prefer that the sisters have short hair.&rdquo; When we hear something like this, we should simply ignore it. The length of the sisters&rsquo; hair does not mean much. Therefore, we can allow a brother to voice his opinion. We should not argue or fight over such insignificant matters. However, suppose someone says, &ldquo;Christ is only a man. He does not have the divine nature.&rdquo; Every brother and sister should immediately stand up to say no, for this is a blasphemy against Christ. Furthermore, such speaking damages God&rsquo;s economy because God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense the Christ who is both God and man. Because the church is the pillar and base of the truth, every member has the responsibility to protest against this kind of heretical speaking. We must bear the truth concerning Christ&rsquo;s person. We all need to see God&rsquo;s charge in the New Testament not to teach things different from God&rsquo;s economy. The proper length of a sister&rsquo;s hair, however, is not worthy of disputation. It is better to stay away from any disputation concerning such minor things.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OURSELVES UNTO GODLINESS</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul said, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; In this verse the manifestation of God in the flesh refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the church. Christ was taken up in glory in His ascension before He was preached among the nations and believed on in the world. Because &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; is listed last in verse 16, it must refer not only to Christ&rsquo;s ascension but also to the church&rsquo;s rapture. This is a strong indication that the manifestation of God in the flesh, the great mystery of godliness, includes both Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The manifestation of God in the flesh includes both Christ and the church because Christ is the Head and the church is His Body. If the Head is the manifestation of God, the Body must also be the manifestation of God. Theologians may argue that only Christ is the manifestation of God, but this is illogical, for a person&rsquo;s body has the same life and nature as the head. Based on this definite principle, it is clear that just as Christ, the Head, is the manifestation of God, so also the church, the Body of Christ, is the manifestation of God. This is logical.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 reveals that the church is not only the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth but also the mystery of godliness, that is, the manifestation of God in the flesh. Although we are human beings in the flesh, God dwells in us. Therefore, when we are meeting together, we are the manifestation of God. First Corinthians 14:24-25 says that if the church is meeting properly, an unbeliever who comes into the meeting will say, &ldquo;Indeed God is among you.&rdquo; This indicates that God is manifested in the flesh in the church. Christ manifested God in the flesh as a man on the earth individually, but today God is manifested in the church corporately. This is a great mystery, the mystery of godliness.</p>
<p>The definition of godliness is God manifest in the flesh. Some have recently taught the young people that to always go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting is to be religious and that they should feel free to do something else on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Rather than being concerned about whether this teaching is right or wrong, we should simply consider whether going to do something else on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is godliness. The two Epistles to Timothy were written at a time when the church was in degradation to instruct Timothy how to conduct himself in the house of God. These Epistles do not say that we need to do what is right; rather, they say that we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness (1 Tim. 4:7). Going to an event other than the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is not godliness. Playing basketball on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is not a testimony of godliness to others. This is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of fact. If the young people saw an elder playing basketball during the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, they would be stumbled and perhaps feel free to begin to live in a loose way. If what we do is an expression of godliness, it will edify the saints and minister life to them. My heart was grieved when I heard that such things were being taught to the young people. This is not an opinion or an insignificant matter; it is a subtle teaching creeping in to lower the standard of God&rsquo;s testimony in the churches and corrupt the young people. Another governing principle that we must follow to properly conduct ourselves in the church is to exercise ourselves unto godliness.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;Bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things&rdquo; (v. 8). He was fair, for he did not say that bodily exercise profits nothing. Yes, bodily exercise is profitable, but its profit is very small compared to the profit of exercising ourselves unto godliness. The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is to exercise ourselves unto godliness. We should not do anything that is not a proper testimony of godliness to others. We do not need to consider whether or not something is legal or right but whether it is an expression of godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Let us consider another illustration. Some brothers may go to bars to drink beer. They may tell the other saints that they have been liberated from all bondage and that in the church life there should be no legalities. All the saints need to learn the truths, discern such speaking, and rise up to practice the truth. All the saints should reply, &ldquo;No, in the church life we do not accept this kind of speaking.&rdquo; We must be discerning and strong, not to cause division but to keep the church in the right lane to manifest our God. Our living should be godly, not loose. We should all bring this matter to the Lord. I do not condemn or accuse those who hold such concepts, but I hope that they will bring these things to the Lord, praying, &ldquo;Lord, do You want me to be such a person in Your recovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our daily lives we should not live by regulations, but we should have one governing principle, that is, godliness. In deciding whether or not to wear a certain article of clothing, we should consider whether or not it expresses godliness. We should not care for any outward forms, but we need to take care of the facts. Whatever we say and do and wherever we go, we need to consider whether it is godliness. If we testify concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to our neighbors, some of whom may be Christians, yet one day they see us going into a movie theater, we will lose our testimony. Even though we may be going to see an educational movie, this is not godliness. Moreover, bringing our children to a movie theater, even if it is to see the best educational movie, will create a lust within our children to see movies. We will corrupt our children. The theaters are full of spiritual germs. The conscience of parents who exercise themselves unto godliness would not allow them to take their children into a movie theater. This is not a matter of what is right or wrong, legal or illegal. We should care only for the facts of what is a testimony of godliness to others. Godliness is another governing principle that we need to take care of in order to properly conduct ourselves in the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE HEALTHY TEACHING</h2>
<p>In order to properly conduct ourselves in the house of God, the church, we also need to take care of the healthy teaching. Second Timothy 4:3-4 says, &ldquo;The time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths.&rdquo; The word <em>tolerate</em> is used to indicate enduring some kind of suffering. To some the healthy teaching becomes something that must be tolerated. In a recent training, while listening to my messages, some trainees wrote that they were bored. Listening to the healthy teaching is a suffering to these trainees. Such ones may prefer to hear teachings that will tickle their itching ears. We need to conduct ourselves in the church not according to our itching ears but according to the healthy teaching.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is overly legalistic to refrain from going to movie theaters or other places of worldly entertainment. Our ears may itch to hear such speaking, but we should be governed by the principle of taking care of the healthy teaching. Whether a teaching is boring or tickling does not mean anything; we need to consider only whether or not it is a healthy teaching. It may be a pleasant teaching that tickles our ears but it is not healthy. It is altogether unhealthy to teach that the saints should watch movies. The teaching in the churches must be healthy. Heeding only healthy teaching is another governing principle for our conduct in the church life.</p>
<p>Paul used the terms <em>healthy teaching, healthy words,</em> and <em>healthy speech</em> seven times in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1, 8). He knew that when the church life is in degradation, people will be bored of the healthy teaching and will prefer to have their ears tickled. Therefore, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus reveal that caring for the healthy teaching is a principle that should govern our conduct in the church life. We need to conduct ourselves not according to our opinion or our likes or dislikes but according to the healthy teaching. We should receive and apply any teaching that is spiritually healthy, and we need to reject any teaching that is not healthy. The proper teaching is not a matter of our taste but a matter of what is healthy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND LIVING OUT THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In the Epistles to Timothy Paul stressed the matter of truth. He wrote, &ldquo;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth&rdquo; (2 Tim. 2:15). He mentioned the full knowledge of the truth four times (1 Tim. 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:25; 3:7). We need to see the difference between doctrines and truth. Matters regarding the Lord&rsquo;s table such as whether to serve grape juice or wine, what kind of bread to serve, and whether to pass one large cup or many small cups are all doctrines. However, within the Lord&rsquo;s table is the truth. The truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table includes the Head, the Body, and Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is not mainly to take care of doctrines but to take care of the truth. We should not come to the Lord&rsquo;s table merely to have another meeting or to keep certain forms; rather, we need to know and appreciate the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table. If we do not enter into the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table, the Lord&rsquo;s table will become something formal to us. If the Lord&rsquo;s table becomes something formal to the saints, some may want to drop it because our principle is not to keep any empty forms. This is a problem.</p>
<p>The way to conduct ourselves in the house of God, especially for the leading ones, is to take care of the truth, not merely to care for doctrines. Therefore, all the saints need to know the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table. I am concerned that many saints do not know this truth. They may come only to participate in something formal, concerning which they do not know the truth. We all need to realize where our lack is. Concerning baptism, we need to know the truth, not merely the doctrines. Whether to baptize by immersion or by sprinkling is a matter of doctrine. We need to know and live the reality of baptism. Every day we also need to live the reality, the truth, of the Lord&rsquo;s table. The truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table should be our life and our daily living, and we should come together on the first day of every week to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table as a testimony to the universe of our daily living. We should live daily as the Body for the Head in His death and resurrection.</p>
<p>In John 8:32 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&rdquo; Loose teachings do not liberate us; they only lead us into a loose life. It is the truth that sets us free. In 17:17 the Lord went on to say that the truth sanctifies us. We need to know the truth. In this time of degradation we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must know and live out the truth. This is another principle that should govern our conduct in the church. We need to make the truth our daily living and our daily standard of measurement.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In the entire Bible there is not another verse like 2 Timothy 3:16. Verses 15 through 17 say, &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; The apostle Paul wrote these words purposefully to indicate that when the church is in degradation, whoever desires to be a man of God, a godly man, must take care of the Scriptures. We need to know the Bible from our youth. The way to conduct ourselves in the church is by taking care of the Scriptures. I hope that an atmosphere of loving the Bible will be built up in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be a Bible lover, always eating, reading, and studying the word of God in the Bible.</p>
<p>The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is to know the Bible to the extent that others would call us a &ldquo;Bible man.&rdquo; If we do not know the Bible, we will not know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. If possible, we should read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day. In this way we can easily read the whole Bible once a year. This is not difficult. We need to build up such a good habit in order to be a godly person.</p>
<p>If some young brothers come to my home one day and see that I read many secular magazines and newspapers, they will not think that I am godly. They may think instead that I am worldly and perhaps that I am fleshly. Whether or not we read the newspaper should not be a legal matter, but it is a spiritual fact that if we spend too much time reading worldly publications, we may be led into the indulgence of lust. Rather than spending much time reading worldly publications, we should redeem the time by reading the word of our Father.</p>
<p>The way to conduct ourselves in the church is by becoming someone who loves the Word of God. We should not make the excuse that we were not born with the kind of disposition necessary to be such a person. We have all been reborn with the same life, the life of God. Therefore, we all can study the Bible daily and diligently. We should try to read through the Bible once a year. Furthermore, we should spend at least ten minutes every morning to pray-read two or three verses. The more we pray-read, the more nourishment we receive. We need to eat the word every day to receive the nourishment and become constituted with the truth of the Bible. If we practice this, we will always impress others with godliness, and this will be a glory to God. If this is our daily testimony and this governs our walk in the church life, we will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. By reading the Bible day after day, we will accumulate much knowledge of the Bible. Based on this knowledge of God&rsquo;s Word, we will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. We need to spend time before the Lord to consider the principles we have seen that should govern our conduct in the church. We need to pray about these principles and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace put them all into practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING PREPARED AS SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery will spread not in the way of a movement but in the way of life. As we all grow in life, the churches will increase and spontaneously spread to other cities. Wherever the churches spread, there is the need of some to bear responsibility. For this reason, many saints, especially the young ones, need to spend time to study the Word of God, to be saturated and thoroughly constituted with the Word of God. Then they will be prepared to teach the Word of God. According to the New Testament, teaching is the proper shepherding, for Ephesians 4:11 lists shepherds and teachers as one class of gifted person. If we do not know how to teach, we cannot shepherd. Shepherding is based on teaching. Furthermore, 1 Timothy 5:17 reveals that teaching is the main function of the elders. In order to be qualified as an elder to bear responsibility in a local church, we must be able to teach (3:2). If we can teach, we will be able to shepherd. Therefore, if the young ones study God&rsquo;s Word to be thoroughly saturated and constituted with the Word in the coming years, many of them will be good teachers. Then they will spontaneously become good shepherds and elders. This is the way that the leadership is prepared for the spread of the churches.</p>
<p>Suppose the young people in a locality come together only to have a good time, playing the guitar, singing hymns, and releasing their spirit, but they do not spend time in the Word of God and are not exercised in the spiritual experiences. Several years may pass, yet nothing will be built up. Such a situation would be worse than the situation in denominational Christianity, for Christianity at least has seminaries to train some leaders. To only have a good time is a waste of time. We need to come to the church meetings to learn something, to be built up, and to be trained. This is worthwhile. We should mean business in the church life. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony is the most important thing in our life today. Therefore, we need to spend our time, our energy, and even our being to be constituted for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>I encourage all the saints to spend a solid time to enter into the solid things. We should not relax or only seek to have a good time. The church life is not for a good time; it is for something solid. We need to pick up this burden and go to the Lord. We should not use the excuse that we are weak. We are all weak, but He who is in us is strong. We do not have the energy in ourselves, but His grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9). We all need to look to the Lord for His grace that we may come up to His standard. I hope that all the saints will legally spend time in the Word of God. If we all practice this, the church life will be healthy, strong, rich, and genuinely living. We all need to honor the headship of Christ, bear the truth, exercise ourselves unto godliness, take care of the healthy teaching, and study the Word. By spending time in the Word, we will be filled with the knowledge of the divine Word and will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the proper way to meet for saints who live in small cities near a larger city with an established church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The principle we have practiced for many years has been that the saints living in the smaller cities initially meet with the church in the larger city. Then as the number of saints in a smaller locality gradually increases, we encourage them to have home meetings in their locality for prayer and fellowship. As they continue to grow, they eventually begin to have the Lord&rsquo;s table and become the church in that locality. Once they begin to meet as the church in that locality, they have the same standing as the church in the larger locality. There are no higher or lower churches; rather, all are on the same level. Eventually, there may be one larger church in a central city and perhaps ten or fifteen smaller churches in the surrounding small cities. In such a situation, all are local churches and are on the same level. There is no head church. In this way, the churches are prevented from becoming an organization, which would lead to hierarchy and insult the headship of Christ.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the best way to study the Bible?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Brother Watchman Nee often said that we need to have two copies of the Bible: a clean copy without any marks in it to use in the morning for nourishment and another copy for writing notes. It is best to use a large Bible with wide margins during our times of reading and studying. When we gain new understanding and see new light, we should write notes in the margins. The way of being nourished in the morning and the way of reading a few chapters later in the day are common; they should be practiced by all the saints. However, some who truly love the Bible also need to study the Bible book by book. To do this, we first need to pray concerning which book to study. Then, besides our times of coming to the word for nourishment and to read a few chapters, we need to spend time to study whichever book the Lord leads us to study.</p>
<p>To study a book of the Bible word by word, we need an interlinear version to find the accurate meaning of every Greek or Hebrew word. Then while studying the meaning of each word, we should try to expound each verse, explaining or interpreting it. This is the way to study a verse efficiently. We should study a book verse by verse until we finish the whole book. Then we can go through the book again to study its main topics or subjects. After studying one subject, word, or topic, finding cross-references in other books and comparing other portions of the Word, we should find and study other subjects in the book. Such topical studies will help us to dig into the depths of a book. By spending time to study in these two ways, we will fully enter into a book. Through the past twenty centuries many different ways have been used to study the Bible, the greatest of all books. Among the many ways to study the Bible, the most general and effective ways are the ways I have mentioned.</p>
<p>To study a book of the Bible word by word and according to different topics, we need the help of reference books such as Greek and Hebrew lexicons and concordances. The best two concordances are Strong&rsquo;s <em>Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</em> and Young&rsquo;s <em>Analytical Concordance to the Bible.</em> Vine&rsquo;s <em>Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words</em> is a great help to us. Wuest&rsquo;s Expanded Translation, the Amplified Bible, and Vincent&rsquo;s <em>Word Studies in the New Testament</em> also are helpful. Furthermore, the Life-study messages are a great help to understand any book. If we use all the reference books and the Life-studies, we will gain a thorough, all-inclusive view of any book in the Bible. Every book of the Bible will become transparent to us.</p>
<p><em>Question: What other Christian books are beneficial to read?</em></p>
<p>Answer: All the books by Brother Watchman Nee and by me are healthy and helpful in life and truth. Besides these, there are other good books, such as Andrew Murray&rsquo;s <em>The Holiest of All</em> on Hebrews and W. H. Griffith Thomas&rsquo;s <em>Commentary on Romans,</em> the top exposition on Romans. These can help us to some extent if we have the time to read them.</p>
<p><em>Question: When we spend time to study the Word, what is the best way to release all these riches so that we do not store up an excess of riches?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we spend time to study the Word, we will accumulate much knowledge. However, we need to remember that we must have Christ and the church as the governing vision. Otherwise, the more biblical knowledge we pick up, the more trouble we will make for the church. If our knowledge of the Bible is controlled and governed by the great mystery, Christ and the church, then our Bible knowledge will strengthen our vision, will be used properly, and will not damage the church life. Without the governing vision of Christ and the church, our biblical knowledge may become a damaging factor.</p>
<p>It is doubtful that we can accumulate an excess of riches from the Bible. If we try to share something, we will probably realize that we are not very rich. If we do not try to buy anything, we may think that a hundred dollars is a large sum of money. However, if we shop at a department store, we will see that a hundred dollars is very little. We do not need to purposely seek opportunities to release our riches. We only need to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. Then the Lord will lead us concerning where, when, and what to share to others. If we decide to visit other Christian groups to release our riches, we are making ourselves the lord. We have no right to make such a decision. Instead, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am Your servant. I live You, grow You, and produce You. Lord, whatever I do must be under Your command. If You do not direct me, I will not speak to anyone.&rdquo; If the Lord leads us to speak to a certain person, we should simply follow His leading. When we speak to others under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, whatever we need will come not only out of our accumulated knowledge of the Bible but also from the Lord&rsquo;s instant supply. The Lord will instantly supply the words we need for such a living contact. This is the proper way to contact others. We do not need to make a decision to contact someone. If we simply live day by day in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, He will lead us. In this way we respect His headship.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is it important to memorize verses from the Bible?</em></p>
<p>Answer: I am not against memorization, but the best and most helpful way to enter into the Word is not to memorize but to study. We should not memorize a verse without ever studying it. We need to study the meaning of each verse.</p></body></html>
