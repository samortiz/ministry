   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE FOR THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter the Holy Spirit put some points together to show us how to have the proper church life for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The proper church life is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have the proper church life, we have the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being like Little Children</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we should learn to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to be converted and to become like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There should be no giants among us; we should all be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>None of us have titles, for we are all children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The disciples asked the Lord Jesus, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matt 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone wants to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus answered, "Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens" 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can you tell us who are the great ones in the local churches?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a concept does not originate from the kingdom of the heavens but from the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The concept of greatness comes from the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you desire to have the proper church life, the first thing you must realize is that there are no giants in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of the church people should be little people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being Dependent upon One Another</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Next, we should realize that little children are very dependent on others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every giant, on the contrary, is an independent person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians want to be independent, to exercise their character, and to be strong in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the local churches we all must be dependent like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I need you, and you likewise need me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of us can afford to be independent; we are all dependent upon one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Little children depend upon one another and recognize their need for a home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever they have problems, they simply refer the problems to their home, and they listen to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A giant does not listen to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if a giant does have a problem, he may hide the problem from his home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is so good to be able to tell our problems to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should realize that we are little children who are dependent on our home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is terrible not to listen to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus said that if anyone will not hear the church he should be considered as a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These were very ugly terms in the Lord's time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you were a Gentile or a tax collector, you were considered to be mean and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not listen to the church, then in the eyes of the Lord and in the eyes of the church, we too become mean and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the proper church life, we all are little children who depend upon our home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We refer our problems to our home, and we listen to what the home says about them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have covered more about this matter in the book, How to Meet.</S>
