   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO THE DEATH OF THE MAN-SAVIOR 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 23:26-56</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the crucifixion of the Man-Savior 23:26-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the last nineteen centuries there have been many studies of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For what purpose did the Lord Jesus die, and who actually put Him to death?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, why did He die, and who killed Him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even certain Jewish scholars have been seeking answers to these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even genuine and faithful Christians, those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus, may not have a full knowledge of the purpose of His death and of who killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am concerned that some among us, both young and old, do not know who killed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How would you answer the question concerning who killed the Man-Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may say that we killed Him and others, that God killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others may say that the Lord was put to death by religion and politics, or that He was killed by our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not try to answer this question by our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we need to come to the honest and accurate record of the Scriptures, especially the record in the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As Luke himself says, he followed all things accurately from the first 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Luke s account may be regarded as reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we read the record in this Gospel, we see that the Lord Jesus was put on the cross by man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was accused by the religious leaders, sentenced to death by Roman rulers, especially Pilate, and then put on the cross by the Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SUFFERING THE PERSECUTION OF MEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 23:26-43 we see that on the cross the Man-Savior suffered the persecution of men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was mocked and ridiculed by both the Jewish leaders and the Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And the people stood by, looking on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the rulers were even sneering and saying, He saved others, let him save himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus was put on the cross at nine o clock in the morning and remained there until three o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that He was on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These six hours may be divided into two groups of three hours each: the first from nine o clock until noon, and the second from noon until three o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the first three hours, the Man-Savior suffered the persecution of men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The religious people ridiculed Him, and the Roman soldiers mocked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, Are you not the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Save yourself and us! v. 39 . Therefore, during the first three hours on the cross, the Lord was a victim of human persecution, and He suffered this persecution as a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SUFFERING THE JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF GOD FOR SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO ACCOMPLISH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE VICARIOUS DEATH FOR THEM</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 23:44-49 we see that, during the second period of the six hours on the cross, the Man-Savior suffered the judgment of God for sinners to accomplish the vicarious death for them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, in 23:26-49 we see two aspects of the Lord s death: the aspect of man s persecution and the aspect of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First the Lord Jesus suffered man s persecution, and He suffered this as a martyr, not as the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then, as the Redeemer, no longer as a martyr suffering persecution, He suffered God s judgment for us, the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Darkness Coming over the Whole Land</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luke 23:44 and 45a say, And it was already about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, the sun s light failing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of The sun s light failing, some manuscripts read, And the sun was darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sixth hour mentioned in verse 44 was, according to our way of reckoning time, twelve o clock noon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Matthew 27:45, darkness was over all the land from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, that is, from twelve o clock noon until three o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who caused darkness to come over the land?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, the high priest, Pilate, and the Roman soldiers were not able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only one who could cause darkness to come at noon was God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This darkness was an indication that the righteous God had come in to judge the Lord Jesus as our Substitute and Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was the unique, universal Substitute for mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From nine o clock until noon, He was persecuted by the Jews and Romans as a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But from noon until three o clock He was dying not as a martyr, but as the Substitute for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because God recognized Him as our Redeemer, God came in to judge Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that during the last three hours the Lord was on the cross, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was during this time that God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God even forsook Him Matt 27:46 because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually the Lord s persecutors did not kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While He was under their persecution, He was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the Lord suffered this persecution for three hours, God came in to put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The darkness that came over the land was a sign of God s coming in. Luke tells us that the darkness came over the whole land, not merely over Jerusalem or Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God caused the sun s light to fail.</S>
