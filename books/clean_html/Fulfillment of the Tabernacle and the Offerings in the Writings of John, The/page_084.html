<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 8</h1><h2 class=head1>A REVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN</h2><p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. From 1:1 and 14 we see that the eternal God became a man. This took place in time, not in eternity. This incarnated God, God in the flesh, is the tabernacle. This One is also the Lamb of God. Both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God are signs. According to 1:32, John the Baptist testified of Christ, saying, “I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.” Here we see that the Dove is upon the Lamb. Later, when Simon was brought to the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone)” (1:42). This stone is also a sign. In 1:51 the Lord said to Nathaniel that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. Here we see that the Son of Man is the heavenly ladder, and this ladder is related to Bethel, the house of God.<p>In chapter one we have the incarnated God as the tabernacle and the Lamb. Through the Lamb we have the Dove, the Spirit, by whom we become stones for the building of God’s house. Therefore, chapter one begins with the eternal Word and issues in Bethel, the house of God. This is the extract of chapter one of John.<p>In chapter two we have the sign of changing water into wine. As we have pointed out, this signifies changing death into life. In this chapter we also have the sign of the raising up of the destroyed temple. This sign indicates that in resurrection God’s dwelling place is enlarged.<p>In chapter three an elderly, respected, learned gentleman comes to the Lord Jesus. The Lord indicated that even such a person has a serpentine nature and needs Christ, the incarnated One, to die on the cross as his substitute for his redemption. Furthermore, the Lord indicated in this chapter that this gentleman needed to be regenerated in order to become part of the bride as Christ’s universal increase.<p>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman. Although she was not satisfied in her human life, she pretended to worship God. But her worship was not genuine. Therefore, the Lord Jesus told her that He is the fountain of living water to satisfy her and also the reality for her to worship God.<p>In chapter five the impotent man, who had been ill for thirty-eight years, was enlivened. In this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus annulled all religious things, such as the holy city and the pool of Bethesda. According to the revelation in this chapter, nothing and no one should replace Christ. Only He avails to enliven us. Not even the Scriptures can convey life to us apart from Him. Therefore, we need to come to Him for life.<p>After the Lord annulled the religious things in chapter five, He presented Himself as the bread of life to the hungry ones in chapter six. As the bread of life, the living and true bread of God that came down from heaven, He can nourish us.<p>In chapter seven we see that the Lord Jesus is the living water to quench our thirst. In 7:37 He cried out and said, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.”
