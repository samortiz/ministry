   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOLDING THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:19 we have the words holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does it mean to hold Christ as the Head?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we shall not be separated from Him by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we live by our culture instead of by Christ, we separate ourselves from Christ as the Head and are defrauded of our prize, which is the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those Christians in Colosse who were embracing Gnosticism and living by it were being severed from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were being defrauded, deprived, of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if we are rooted in Christ and walk as He moves, we shall spontaneously absorb the riches of Christ into our being and grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This growth is by holding Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Colossians 2:19 speaks of the supply and of the Body being knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Body is supplied and knit together by holding the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The phrase out from whom in this verse is important.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It indicates that the Body grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In one sense, Christ is the Head; in another sense, He is the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we absorb the riches of the soil, we hold the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, to receive the supply from the Head is to absorb the riches from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to have proper growth as Christians, we need to realize that God has placed us, as living plants, into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we should say, Lord, I want to remain in You and walk whenever You move.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By walking in Christ, we absorb the riches of the soil into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, through the increase of these riches within us, we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Absorbing the riches of the soil is equal to holding Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We grow with the increase from the soil; we also grow as the Body with the supply out from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NOT ALLOWING CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Epistle to the Colossians, Paul tells us to beware of philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we should beware of culture in every form: racial culture, national culture, and self-made and self-imposed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not allow culture to become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although there is no need for us to deliberately try to drop our culture, we should stop appreciating it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we treasured our culture, lovingly embracing it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we see that culture can be a substitute for Christ, we shall no longer treasure it or appreciate it so highly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, we see that we are living plants rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since we are rooted in Him, we should not allow anything to replace Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should simply walk in Him as the living land and grow by absorbing the riches of the soil into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the riches from the soil, who is also the Head, will be ministered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, all the Body will grow with the growth of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Automatically, our culture will be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Continually we should simply walk in Christ, not appreciating our culture and not treasuring it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we walk in Christ, the more we shall absorb the riches of the soil, the rich supply of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, holding the Head, we shall experience the genuine and proper growth in Christ.</S>
