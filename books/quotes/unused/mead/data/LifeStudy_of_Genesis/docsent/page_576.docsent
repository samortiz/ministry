   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 Concerning Gad a Raided by a Raiding Band and Raiding Their Heels</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of the failure of Dan, Jacob called on the Lord for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has answered this call.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, after Dan we have Gad as his continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 19 says, "Gad, a raiding band shall raid him: but he shall raid their heels" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Dan we see the defeat, but with Gad we see the victory brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not consider Dan separate from Gad or Gad separate from Dan They are part of a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dan ends with failure, but Gad, who shall raid the heels of the raiding band, comes in with the recovered victory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b Enlarged by God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Deuteronomy 33:20 says, "Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this victory Gad was enlarged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is exactly the same in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some time ago we may have been defeated, but by means of God's mercy through the prayer of some saints, the salvation of the Lord has come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thereby, we regain the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we are no longer Dan we are Gad, the one who raids the heels of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this victory, we are enlarged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of us can testify that God has enlarged us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c Dwelling as a Lioness, Tearing the Arm,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the Crown of the Head of the Prey</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Deuteronomy 33:20 also says, "He dwelleth as a lioness, and teareth the arm, even the crown of the head" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see that Gad is a lioness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gad is not couching: rather, he is dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an improvement over Judah as a couching lion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gad who is dwelling as a lioness tears the arms and even the crown of the head of the prey.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Moses' poetic language here, the top of the head, the crown, refers to the skull.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This prey, of course, is not an animal, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gad tears the arm of his prey, even the head, the skull of his prey.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that Gad is so strong that he not only defeats his enemy, but also tears him to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He even tears his skull into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The poetry here describes the tearing of the enemy to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Gad, we smash Satan into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Deuteronomy 33 the lioness is not couching for enjoyment; she is dwelling, settling down, and tearing the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems that Gad could say, "Enemy, don't bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to dwell here peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if you trouble me, I will not only tear your arm, but I will also tear your skull into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After that, no one will see your figure again."</S>
