   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPRESSION OF LIVING IS SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been preaching for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have met many people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But I have not yet known of anyone who claimed to be sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In all the places I have traveled through, I have yet to encounter a single individual who can boast of his perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone admits to a greater or lesser extent that there are dark spots and flaws in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have to confess that our way of living is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>NOT REFORMATION BUT REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on this realization, man begins to think of ways to change his mode of living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the purpose of so many religions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But can this be changed?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is true that man should be clean, courteous, and law-abiding and should be taught and cultivated in these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But what is the purpose of this education and cultivation?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may improve a little outwardly, but can he be changed inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know perfectly well that the inward parts are impossible to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not setting up a debate with other religions; we are presenting only this characteristic!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A very crucial point in our faith is the matter of regeneration, not the matter of reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A CORRUPT LIFE WILL NOT EXHIBIT CLEAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our emphasis rests on this fact: not only is the expression of human living corrupt and sinful, but the life itself is corruption and man himself is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People do not like to hear these kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we can only speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man is basically wrong in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is corrupt in nature, and he sins as a result of this corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people admit their bad behavior but will not admit their corrupt self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some admit the latter but do not realize that it is corrupt to the core.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man, being so corrupt, cannot naturally exhibit any clean living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One time when I was in Kaifeng, I talked to a person who admitted that he was wrong in one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a while he confessed that he was wrong in another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I told him frankly that the problem was not whether he did one thing rightly or wrongly; the person was the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the person is wrong, surely the things he does will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are a fish, surely you cannot fly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot blame you for being unable to fly, because you are but a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the man is not proper, the expression of living will not be proper either.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is entirely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not merely a matter of an outward mode of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The human corruption is within him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>USELESS TO HAVE OUTWARD CORRECTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since man is corrupt within, there is no use in correcting him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have a friend who came home from Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the train passed through Wushih, he bought a few dolls for his little daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of the dolls were made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were painted and cutely decorated with bright colors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His daughter was about seven years old.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When she got the toys she was overwhelmed with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately she assumed the role of a mother, cuddling the dolls and putting them to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When it was time to eat, she fed them with food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With her hands she shoveled the rice into the dolls' mouths, saying, "How come you don't eat?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Alas, the faces of the dolls were smeared with grease and rice!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The little girl, acting like her mother, began to wipe the faces with water and towels.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unfortunately, a black spot appeared when one part was wiped.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more she wiped, the bigger the black spot became.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a while, the nose, eyes, and ears were all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was nothing that could be done!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Her father said to her, "Throw them away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will buy you new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Clay dolls cannot be washed."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE ONLY WAY AN EXCHANGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I was there when that story happened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe that trying to improve our human behavior is just like cleaning the faces of those dolls.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We think that if we rid ourselves of our proud attitude and all our lies and behave in a more refined way, we will be a better person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God says that the outward corruption of man is caused by an inward corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The only solution is a basic change of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The recognition of the hopelessness and wickedness of man and the realization of the need for an exchange are the basic foundation in our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>MAN'S HEART IS FILLED WITH EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day I was walking down a street in Shanghai with a friend of mine who has a very active mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said to me, "It is a pity that we cannot see through another's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Would not it be interesting if I could tell at a glance what this person or that person was thinking?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What a pity that we cannot see through the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I said, "This is far from being a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am relieved at not being able to see through another's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not try to guess what others think, because all of man's thoughts are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is nothing other than stealing, deceiving, and treachery in our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no good thought.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the thoughts have to be kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is fortunate that the heart is concealed from our sight by a few bones and some skin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we could see it clearly, we would loathe it immediately."</S>
