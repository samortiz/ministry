   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Making Restitution to a Relative</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Wronged One or to God for the Priest</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the wronged one is deceased, then the restitution should go to his relative.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the trespass, the restitution for the trespass shall go to Jehovah for the priest" v. 8a , just as every man's portions were to be presented to the priest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we have a holy portion to present to God, we give it to the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see that this restitution for dealing with our guilt becomes holy, just like a holy portion given to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we may give this to the church or to one who serves God as a priest and lives by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Propitiation by a Ram</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being Made for Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Numbers 5:8b speaks of "the ram of propitiation with which propitiation is made for him."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Besides confessing and making restitution, the propitiation by a ram was to be made for the guilty one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This ram typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This portion of the Word reveals how fine our God is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we confess our sin to God and then go to make restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Afterward, we come back to God to offer Christ as the ram of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The individual dealing described in these verses may seem like a small matter, but it is like a small screw in a big machine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one small screw is wrong, the whole machine cannot run.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we need this kind of dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church must have the corporate dealings, and the saints must have the individual dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may think that it is impossible to see on earth a church that has been purged of defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to our view, all kinds of confusion, troubles, and defilements are among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, as the story of Elijah makes clear, in God's eyes He has seven thousand hidden ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Elijah accused the people of God, saying, "Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life" Rom 11:3; 1 Kings 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord answered Elijah, saying, "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal" Rom 11:4; 1 Kings 19:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here God seemed to be saying, "Elijah, in your eyes the situation may be a mess, but I am satisfied with these seven thousand."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the centuries, God has always had the "seven thousand" who could be counted on by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, God still has His testimony today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to learn how to be counted among the seven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we need to have a thorough dealing corporately and individually that will keep us right according to God's conditions and terms for the formation of His fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apparently, the formation of such a fighting army cannot be seen today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in God's eyes there is such a formation, and there is such an army.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fighting for God is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God still has a people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He can see His army fighting and His priesthood serving.</S>
