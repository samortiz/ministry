   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. The Father in Heaven, the Son on the Earth,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Spirit in the Air</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Father spoke in heaven concerning the Son, the Son stood in the water on the earth, and the Spirit soared as the dove in the air Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The three of the Trinity here are in three locations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ the Son, after His baptism, was standing in the water, and the Father said, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the Spirit as a dove soaring in the air descended upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father as the source must be in heaven, the Son in His incarnation as the course must be on the earth, and the Spirit as the flow must be soaring in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is different from the view of the Triune God in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 10:30 the Lord said, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not say, "I am one with the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can say that we are one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord Jesus and the Father, They two, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John there is the mystical view that the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No doubt, They two are also in the Spirit and the Spirit is in Them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father Choosing, the Son Redeeming,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and the Spirit Sealing</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Father chose the believers before the foundation of the world in eternity past, the Son redeemed them in time, and the Spirit seals them after they believe in the Son Eph 1:4, 6-7, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Evidence That the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are Economically Three</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Words like these in the Scripture are strong evidence that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are economically three.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, God's elect participate in what the Triune God has done and enjoy Their work with Themselves for their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By God acting economically, we can participate in what He is and what He has worked out for our pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. The Order among the Three</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the three are equal, there is an order among Them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is similar to our situation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we are equal, there is also a proper order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is the Head 1 Cor 11:3 , and the Son subjects Himself to the Father John 5:19, 30; 8:28; 1 Cor 15:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous it is that one of the three, who is the centrality and universality of the Triune God, subjects Himself to the Father, admitting that the Father is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the Head's subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Also, the Spirit testifies concerning the Son John 15:26; 16:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit never talks about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He always talks about Christ, testifies of Christ, to glorify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning the Triune God, the theology of today's Christianity is deformed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, many believe that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is tritheism, which is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why we put out the booklet entitled What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such deformed theology has forced us to put the truth in writing through publications such as Affirmation and Critique.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through these writings, the Lord will vindicate His truth.</S>
