   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. The Girdle of Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 6:14 says, "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the purpose of standing, our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and expressed by us as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our being for spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our living must have a principle and a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is nothing less than God in Christ expressed in our living in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When such a truth girds our loins, we are made strong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The truth with which we are girded for spiritual warfare is the Christ we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Philippians 1:21 Paul says, "To me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Christ whom Paul lived was his girdle of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Christ was God expressed and revealed in Paul's daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Paul's daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Paul had been girded about with truth, he had the strength to stand. b.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Breastplate of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness, which covers our conscience, signified by the breast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fighting against Satan, our accuser, we need a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But no matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Righteousness is a matter of being right with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have a problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which our faith and boldness will leak out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such righteousness is Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The righteousness which covers our conscience and that guards us from Satan's accusations is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the breastplate of righteousness is related both to Christ and to His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apart from His blood, Christ cannot cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness to cover our conscience. c.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 6:15 says, "Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our feet need to be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The phrase "the firm foundation of the gospel of peace" means the establishment of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ made peace for us on the cross both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel Eph 2:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness for our feet to be shod with.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we shall have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The peace for such a firm foundation is also Christ Eph 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The gospel of peace spoken of in Ephesians 6:15 is the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross for us to be one with God and for the Gentile believers to be one with the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This peace is our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With this peace there is preparation, readiness, a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This firm foundation is a secure footing for our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross is a firm footing, a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we fight against the evil powers, the peace Christ accomplished is a firm foundation for our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We fight in peace and with peace; we fight by standing in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the firm foundation of the gospel of peace are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is our truth, our righteousness, and our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is God expressed and revealed, Christ is the righteous element that covers us, and Christ is the peace that enables us to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, if we would be victorious in the spiritual warfare, we need Christ as our girdle of truth, as our breastplate of righteousness, and as our peace to be our firm foundation.</S>
