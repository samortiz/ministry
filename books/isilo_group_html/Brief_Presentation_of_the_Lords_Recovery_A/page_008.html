In His Resurrection and Ascension, Becoming<br>both the Lord of All and the Christ of God</H2><P>In His resurrection and ascension, Christ became both the Lord of all and the Christ of God (Acts 2:36; Rev. 11:15). He became the Lord of us, and He became the Christ of God to carry out God's economy. He is the Christ of God, the anointed One of God to carry out God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Being the Firstborn of All Creation<br>and the Firstborn of the Resurrection<br>from among the Dead</H2><P>Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and the Firstborn of the resurrection from the dead (Col. 1:15, 18). God has two creations, the old creation and the new creation. The old creation came into being by God's creating work. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of the old creation. The second creation, God's new creation, came into being by and in resurrection. According to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the Firstborn of the resurrection from among the dead. Thus, Christ is the Firstborn of both creations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6.
