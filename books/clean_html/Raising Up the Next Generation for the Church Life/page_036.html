<h2 class="head1">SAMUEL&rsquo;S GOD-WORSHIPPING PARENTS</h2>
<p>Humanly speaking, Samuel&rsquo;s origin was his God-worshipping parents (vv. 1-8).</p>
<p>Elkanah and Hannah remained in this line of life not merely for God&rsquo;s eternal salvation but for His eternal purpose. God&rsquo;s salvation is mainly for our benefit, whereas God&rsquo;s purpose is related to the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESPECIALLY HIS GOD-SEEKING MOTHER<br />
WITH HER PRAYER</h2>
<p>The origin of Samuel was especially his God-seeking mother with her prayer (vv. 9-18). Her prayer was an echo of the heart&rsquo;s desire of God. Her prayer was a human cooperation with the divine move for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>God wanted a Samuel, yet He needed Hannah&rsquo;s cooperation to pray to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I need a son.&rdquo; This prayer was very human, yet it was a cooperation with the divine move for God&rsquo;s economy. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Samuel,</em> pp. 9-10, 11)</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOT&rsquo;S CHILDREN BEING CORRUPTED</h2>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s children were corrupted by living in the wicked city. The word of the angels in Genesis 19:12 indicates that Lot might have had sons as well as daughters. In chapter 18 Abraham might have considered that there were at least ten people in Lot&rsquo;s family...Lot had to tell his sons-in-law and his children that God was about to judge that city. But when Lot preached the gospel to them, some would not believe the word from the Lord, thinking that he was joking. Verse 14 of chapter 19 says, &ldquo;And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Rise up; go forth from this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But it seemed to his sons-in-law as though he were joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others of Lot&rsquo;s children had no sense of morality (vv. 30-35). Look at what his daughters did after they escaped from the city! After escaping from Sodom, Lot and his daughters still had wine with them (v. 32). If they had not brought the wine with them, how else could they have had it in the cave where they were dwelling? How drugged they were by the sinful situation in Sodom! When I was visiting some saints in Las Vegas in 1963, they vindicated their living in that city, saying, &lsquo;&lsquo;It is not wrong for us to stay in this gambling city, because we are here as a testimony for the Lord.&rsquo;&rsquo; I did not argue with them, but deep within myself I said, &lsquo;&lsquo;If you stay here for some years, your children will have no sense about the wickedness of gambling.&rsquo;&rsquo; Many of the young people today have been drugged. Look at the way they dress: there is no sense of morality or feeling of shame. Many times when I am on the street I have to shut my eyes. For young ladies to be without a sense of shame is to be without protection. Throughout the whole world the sense of shame and morality has been drugged. Because most of the young people were raised in a sinful atmosphere, their senses have been drugged. But if they would come in to the church life and remain in its pure atmosphere for a few months, they would never return to the sinful world. They would be unable to stand its smell.</p>
<p>We live in an evil age and need protection from it. Our family and our children must be protected. We all must escape Sodom and shut our doors to its evil atmosphere. If we do not, our descendants will be drugged. How could Lot and his children have conducted themselves in the way they did after Sodom was destroyed? Because their sense of morality had fallen so low. If we remain in the fresh air, we shall immediately sense the bad smell of immorality. But if we do not discern any bad smell, it means that our sense of morality has been drugged. (<em>Life-study of Genesis,</em> pp. 696-697)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>At this point I would like to say a word to the young people. As Christians, we may need to read the newspapers to know the world situation. I read a newspaper nearly every day, but certain pages I would never read, for they are defiling. Once your mind has been defiled by looking at a certain picture, it will be very difficult for you to remove this defiling element. Furthermore, we should not listen to certain kinds of conversations or touch things that are unclean. But most important, we should abstain from fornication. We must keep, preserve, safeguard, our vessel clean in sanctification before God. It must be holy, separated, and saturated with God and also kept in honor before man. (<em>Life-study of 1 Thessalonians,</em> p. 196)</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING AWAY THEIR FOREIGN GODS&mdash;IDOLS</h2>
<p>Jacob told his household and all that were with him to put away the foreign gods that were among them (Gen. 35:2). When Jacob and his household were fleeing from Laban, Rachel took the household images (31:34-35). Prior to chapter 35, Jacob never charged Rachel to put them away. But after God had told him to go up to Bethel, everyone had to abandon their foreign gods, their idols. This is a shadow, a type, that is developed throughout the Bible. According to both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the first thing we must eliminate for the sake of God&rsquo;s dwelling place is our idols.</p>
