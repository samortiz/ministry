<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:16-24</h1><p>In the two foregoing messages we began to consider the fourth sign found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the divine Trinity. We have seen that the divine Trinity is for the dispensing of the Triune God. We have covered ten matters related to the Father and seventeen matters related to the Son. Beginning with this message, we shall consider a number of matters related to the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The One Who Enters In, the Applier</h2><p>In the divine Trinity, the Father is the source, and the Son is the expression. Now we need to see that the Spirit is the entering in of the Triune God, the Applier. The Father plans, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies. Hence, the Father is the Planner, the Son is the Accomplisher, and the Spirit is the Applier. The Son has accomplished all that the Father has planned. Now the Spirit comes to apply all the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished. Here we see the Three of the Triune God working together. The Planner is the source, the Accomplisher is the expression, and the Applier is the One who enters into us. When the Spirit as the Applier enters into us, He brings with Him whatever the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished. This is the working of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—to dispense Himself and all that He has planned and accomplished, and is now applying, into our being.<p>One verse in the Gospel of John that speaks of the entering in to us of the Spirit is 14:17; “Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” This verse speaks concerning the indwelling of the Spirit. Here we have the first mention of the indwelling Spirit, a matter that is fully developed in the Epistles (1 Cor. 6:19; Rom. 8:9, 11). John 20:22 also indicates that the Spirit enters into us: “And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” Here we have the receiving of the Spirit promised in 14:17. The Lord’s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.<p>I hope that we shall not only learn all the matters we have been covering concerning the Trinity, but also experience them and minister them to others. I am especially thankful that the young people have the opportunity to learn these matters. I encourage all the saints to put the things you have heard into daily practice. This means that we need to apply them in our daily living. If we apply these matters daily, we shall possess them as our life supply. Then it will be easy for us to minister these truths to others. This will further the spreading of the Lord’s recovery; it will enable the circle of the recovery to expand. The Lord’s recovery will spread by the saints’ living of all the things they have seen.<p>We have the Applier within us, and day by day He is applying all that has been planned by the Father and accomplished by the Son. The more we practice these matters and live them, the more opportunity we give to the Spirit to apply them to us. Therefore, we need to continue practicing in our daily life.<h2 class=head3>The Consummation of the Triune God</h2><p>If we read John 14:16-24 carefully, we shall see that the Spirit is the ultimate Person of the Triune God. In other words, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. I use the words “ultimate” and “consummation” to refer to the Spirit’s being the entering into us of the Triune God. We have seen that the Father dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). Then the Son came as the expression of the Father, the expression of the unapproachable and invisible God (John 1:18). Although the Son came as the expression of the Father, this was not the ultimate, the consummate, coming of the Triune God. After the Son came to express the Father, the Spirit comes as the realization of the Son.
