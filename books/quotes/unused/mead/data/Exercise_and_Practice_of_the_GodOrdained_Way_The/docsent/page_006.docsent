   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR PRINCIPLES OF OUR SPIRITUAL SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we will fellowship some of the principles of the spiritual service which we should render to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are four principles we all have to see.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Service Must Be in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we must see that our service, our serving of God, must be as a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why Paul, after so much teaching in the first eleven chapters of Romans, brought the saints to the matter of the Body in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, "I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice" v. 1 . Based upon this, he went on to talk about the Body service vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said we all are members of one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Look at the members of your body; not one is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every one, big or small, is moving, acting, functioning, in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Look at today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Needless to say we cannot see the Body, we cannot even see a proper group of Christians serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are so many opinions, concepts, and different views.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is wrong, and who is right?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, everybody is not only wrong but also detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be very right, but you are right and detached.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your hand may be clean, but it is detached.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be better to be dirty and remain in the body, than to be clean and detached.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Service Must Be in Our Spirit and by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second principle of our spiritual service is that we must serve in our spirit and by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without these two spirits, our service is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul says, "God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel" Rom 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He also says that we are those "who serve by the Spirit of God" Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know this, but we do not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being filled with the Spirit and having the outpouring of the Spirit does not depend upon our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It depends upon how much we are willing to take Christ's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross must come; then Pentecost follows.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must take Christ's death; then the Spirit will follow the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is where our power is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must also learn not to serve by our natural ability or skill.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn how to look unto the Lord, how to trust in Him, and how to receive His death and put His death into our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must also have the proper, adequate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will be people full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit will fill us within and clothe us without.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will be people having the Spirit acting in our spirit and working through our spirit, and we will use the power of the Spirit by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is needed in all of these four steps: in preaching the gospel, in nourishing the new ones, in perfecting the saints, and in prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So many saints cannot prophesy because they are short of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are short of the Holy Spirit, and they do not know how to use their spirit, how to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they would practice to exercise their spirit to touch the Holy Spirit, eventually it would be easy for them to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Service Must Be by Life</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another principle is that our service must be by life, not by ability or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must learn how to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we meet someone, we must learn how to exercise our spirit to dispense the living Christ with His living word into this person as life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both feeding and nourishing imply the impartation of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The feeding of a child by its mother is a kind of life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, the matters of perfecting and prophesying could only be carried out by the Spirit with life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our Service Must Be for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lastly, our service must be for the building up of the Body of Christ and not for our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regardless of how long we have been serving in the Lord's recovery, we may not have rendered much building up to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need to see these four principles of our spiritual service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our service must be: in the Body, in our spirit and by the Holy Spirit, by life, and for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
