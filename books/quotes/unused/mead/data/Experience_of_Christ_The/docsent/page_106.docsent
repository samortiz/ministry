   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THRESHOLD OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we remain in the death of Christ, it is not the end; it is the threshold of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever I remain in the death of Christ, this death brings me into resurrection, and Christ rises up with me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The problem is that we do not remain in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not stay in His death, Christ cannot rise up in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Resurrection requires the ground of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Obviously, Christ could not have been resurrected if He had not died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But because He died, He could be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The principle of life is that where there is death, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After considering all these points, we should no longer try to die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we should cease from all our striving.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first stanza of a hymn expresses this very well:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Buried with Christ and raised with Him too;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is there left for me to do?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Simply to cease from struggling and strife,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simply to walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Glory be to God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we try anything, we should try doing what this hymn suggests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been buried, and Christ is resurrected with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day after day, we need to be reminded that we have already been buried and that our position is in death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For us to remain in death is to be like a seed remaining in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, the life within the seed will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, when we remain in His death, Christ who is the life within us will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not stones, but grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The difference between a stone and a grain of wheat is that the grain of wheat has life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the grain is sown into the soil and remains there, sooner or later the life within the grain will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, Christ as the life in us will rise up if we stay in His death.</S>
