   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO JUDGE WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us turn our attention now to a basic question: How do we touch others' spirit with our spirit, and how do we judge men with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for us to be able to judge men, our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no shortcut in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When this happens, our spirit will become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the outer man is not broken, the spirit cannot become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our spirit is not useful when it is surrounded and affected by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the outer man is too strong, the spirit cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit can be bound by either the mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's children have imprisoned their spirits because their outer man is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason the outer shell must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit will be released only when the outer shell is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Something stands between us and other men our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for our spirit to touch others' spirits, the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only then will we know others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A grain of wheat must be broken before the life within can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not broken, our spirit cannot become useful; we will lack the basic organ for diagnosing men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All spirits are similar in nature, and it should be an easy task for a person to release his spirit and to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But our spirit can be in close fellowship with others' spirits only when the outer man is broken, and we can be in close fellowship with God only to the extent that the outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only those whose outer man has been broken can exercise their spirit to sense and judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first thing we should do as we listen to others is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the course of listening to the conversation of the brothers and sisters, our whole being should be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This does not mean that we should be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every faculty of our being should be in high alert, listening attentively to what is being said.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing we should exercise is our spirit, not our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our mind should only be considered as a supplementary organ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our spirit is clean, meek, and pliable, their words will touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our spirit will receive an impression from their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will know whether their spirit is defiled or clean, hard or soft.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit will sense any subjectivity, emotion, or thoughts in others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In contacting others, our spirit must be absolutely calm, gentle, and pure before we can touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not try conjecturing with our mind; we should try to touch others with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a more certain way of knowing a person than listening to a report about him for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to humble ourselves and learn this way slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In time we will learn our lessons well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not expect us to finish our learning within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to spend at least three to five years on this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our natural mind is not the chief means of knowing men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We put no trust in human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we think we can work with our natural mind alone, we are very far from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to learn, and we have to observe the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we do this, we will realize that many brothers and sisters are on the wrong track.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This learning is not for the purpose of increasing our own knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not for finding fault or criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is for the purpose of edifying, helping, and ministering to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not for tearing others down or for finding faults in others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we know how to exercise our spirit and if we increasingly contact others in the spirit, we will render them much help.</S>
