<h2 class="head2">Kweilin, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>We are still meeting three times a week for prayer and worship. Every meeting has seven to eight persons. Sisters from Kwangtung, Lu Tzi-chan, and Du Ai-jen left here for Chu-Jiang on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth. Mrs. Chiang's family will go to Kuei-yang on the thirtieth. Nan-Meng was burned, but the house of Sister Sun was preserved and did not suffer any damage. I have been waiting and delaying the matter of leaving Kweilin. I am still not clear and cannot decide whether I should leave. Please pray for me so that my footsteps would be in His light and would be preserved by Him. Sister Shu-fang may take up a job at the provincial hospital. Sister Yang Ying-ying will go to Ling-Chuan tomorrow. In the future, please direct your letters to [omitted].</p><p>Sister Tze-ping, January 7, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-Shan, Kwangtung Province</h2><p>A few families have moved to Hong Kong and Macao because of the war. The rest are hiding in the countryside temporarily. The meetings are in Gung-Ho-Shi as usual. Should the situation become more tense, we will move to meet in the countryside, the Lord willing. Please pray much for us. If the mail route is closed, please direct letters to [omitted]. Because wire transfers are impossible now, I am forwarding X dollars in stamps to be used for The Open Door. My last hospital address is no longer valid. Please direct mail to [omitted].</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Chai Zhi-yun, November 11, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Correspondence from Hong Kong and Macao</h2><p>The Lord has raised up His own work in Macao. Since Brother Luan, Miss Wang, and the senior Mrs. Nee worked here for a week, over ten brothers and sisters have been baptized into the Lord's name. We truly thank and praise the Lord for this. We hope that the Lord will be gracious to us and set up His own testimony in the near future so that He will gain the glory. Sister Wang was in Hong Kong conducting meetings for three weeks. In the beginning they borrowed the Yu-Ren Chapel. During the last two weeks, they used the meeting hall on Shek-Kip-Mei Street and conducted two weeks of Bible study for the believers. The Lord blessed His own work. Presently, Brother Luan, Mrs. Nee, and Miss Wang have gone to Swatow for work and will be back in Hong Kong in a month or two. After they come back, they will decide where to go next. The work in Hong Kong and Macao must wait for their return before anything can be settled.</p><p>Brother Ho Nai-yee, January 23</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Indonesia</h2><p>Dear Brother Faithful Luk in the Lord:</p><p>Since you are able to come to Dutch Indonesia, this proves that the Lord has opened a straight way for you. The places where you were are far from Java, and we have not even heard of the names of these places before. Yet the Lord has brought you to these places. We truly have to praise Him for His greatness and wonder. We see that the Lord is not a respecter of persons. "The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen." May the Lord's grace overshadow you, and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you so that you receive abundant power to strive together in oneness for the Lord's holy work. The brothers and sisters in Surabaya have grown recently. However, we are still young. May the Lord bless us so that we may grow and mature. The work of the preaching of salvation is still not being carried out yet, and this matter has been a burden on our heart. We do hope that this burden can be released from our heart. We hope that the Lord will bring you to us soon. Yet it must be according to the Lord's own will. Please tell us a little of your experience of coming to Indonesia, and please pray for us. Peace to you in the Lord! Greetings to the saints who are with you.</p><p>Brothers Dai Chung-ming, Chen En-shen, Wang Fen-hsing</p>
