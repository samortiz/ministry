   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIVER AND TREE IN THE STREET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In all of America there is not such a highway as this golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a spiral that begins at the throne of God and the Lamb at the top of the mountain and spirals around until the last spiral covers all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This street is of two lanes, with the living water of life flowing in the midst.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever the street goes, the river flows.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we walk on the golden way, we will have the continual flowing of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best check to see whether we are on the divine way or not is the flow within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may say that it is all right for you to do a certain thing, but do you have the flow within?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you have the flow of the water of life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do not, you have turned away from the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine way is full of the flowing of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tree of life also grows in the river of life, which is between the two lanes of the golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we enter the gate, we have three things: the golden street, the flow of the river of life, and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is just the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine nature is the Father, the tree of life is the Son, and the flow of the river of life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While we are walking on the golden street, we are drinking of the living water and eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we are living, behaving, walking, and having our being in God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are drinking of the Spirit and eating of the Son that we may live in the Father s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the way the Triune God is getting into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Father is our way, the Spirit is our drink, and the Son is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a teaching of the Trinity; this is the real experience of the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in our daily living as we walk in the divine nature, drink of the Holy Spirit, and eat Jesus as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WAY TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People are always asking me concerning the way to have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is really difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have published a book entitled, How To Meet, and by the title many have thought that it gives directions concerning how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I can assure you that the more you read this book, the more you will not know how to meet!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My intention in publishing this book was to puzzle all those who think they know how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After reading it, I believe you will never think that you know how to meet again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some say that the way to meet is in 1 Corinthians 14, but they are still not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one can be clear how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way is not in the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way is in the divine nature of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to meet is to take the divine nature of the Father, drink of the Spirit, and eat of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, the Lord will take away all our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, we will not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will only know to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we will take the divine nature as our way, the Triune God will flow all of His divine elements into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This flow will also carry away all our old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will have a real replacement, and we will become golden!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why in the book of Revelation the church is seen as a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Jerusalem is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The whole city is of gold Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a universal golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can we become such a church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by walking in the divine nature of the Father, drinking of the Spirit, and eating of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day we are walking in the street, drinking of the river, and eating the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This signifies that the Triune God is getting into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>ENJOYING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Poor Christianity never could understand the book of Revelation, but it is so clear in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do believe that we have all passed through the pearl gates, and we are now walking in the golden way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here is the flow of life and the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we enjoy the Triune God by drinking of the water of life and eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By taking the divine nature we have the flow for drinking and the tree for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is new, living, real, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we take care of God s divine nature within, we sense that the water of life is flowing, and the tree of life is supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the real enjoyment of the Triune God through drinking and eating.</S>
