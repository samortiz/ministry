In writing to the Corinthians, Paul was serving them God's word. He wrote out of much affliction and anguish of heart. He was delivering God's word through many tears. Here was a man whose entire being was into his speaking. His whole being constituted his speaking. His writing was full of his human feelings. When God's word came to him, he was filled with affliction and anguish of heart, and he wrote through many tears. While he was writing, his human elements were mingled with God's word, and he released God's word this way. His human elements enhanced God's word and made it all the more God's word. Paul was not void of feelings and thoughts. He was not like a tongue-speaker, who receives a word and passes it on without the mind having any effect upon the word itself. Paul wrote God's word with much feeling and exercise of thought. As God's word was uttered, he was in much affliction and anguish of heart, and he wrote through many tears. This is a New Testament minister of the word.</p><p>God's word is expressed through man, the entire man. As such, man's characteristics, idiomatic expressions, tone of voice, and subjective experiences before God all flow through the word. Through the word we can find the extent to which a man has been taught by God, disciplined by God, and tested by God. When God's word comes to man, it can be expressed through man's human elements without damaging God's word. It does not have to be contaminated. This is what it means to be a minister of the word in the New Testament. A New Testament minister of the word is one who has been taught by God for many years and one whom God can freely use. When the word reaches such a man, it can flow through him freely. The divine word will suffer contamination only if the human elements which interact with God's word are fleshly or natural.</p><p>Only when God's word has been impregnated with the human elements is such a word complete. Do not be mistaken; God's word is not just one commandment or ten commandments. The Bible shows us clearly that there is a human flavor and human elements within God's word. God has put His word into man and entrusted man to speak His word. Moreover, He requires that man's condition be right so that He can include man in His speaking. The basic principle of God's speaking is the principle of the Word becoming flesh. God is not satisfied with having His word alone; He wants His word to become flesh, to become part of man's word. This does not mean that God's word has been downgraded to the status of being just man's word. It means that God's word has been seasoned with man's flavor. However, it is preserved as His pure word. It is truly man's word and at the same time truly God's word. It is genuinely God's word and at the same time genuinely man's word. The New Testament ministry of the word is man speaking God's word. In reading the book of Acts as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, we find men speaking God's word. In reading 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, we also find a man speaking God's word. God's word is manifested through man's word and expressed through human elements. It is man speaking, yet God recognizes it as His word.</p><p>If this is the case, how great is the responsibility of those who speak God's word! If a man makes a mistake or if he introduces unclean elements into his speaking, God's word will be contaminated and will suffer loss. We must realize that the critical factor in speaking God's word is not the amount of Bible knowledge one possesses. It is useless if all one has are empty doctrines and a knowledge of the Bible. It is possible for these to remain completely objective matters to a person. A man can preach all he wants about these things yet remain absolutely separate from them. We cannot be like the Lord Jesus, who was the word becoming flesh. However, as ministers of the word, we should realize that God's word is expressed through our flesh; He needs our flesh. This is why our flesh needs to be dealt with by God. Daily we have to have transactions with God; we need to experience His dealings. If we are short in any way, God's word will be damaged as soon as it passes through us and mingles with our own words.</p><p>Do not think that anybody can speak God's word. Only one kind of person can speak God's word&mdash;the one who has passed through His dealings. The greatest challenge to a speaker of God's word is not the appropriateness of the subject or the choice of words but the very person of the speaker. If the person is wrong, everything else will be wrong. May God teach us the genuine way to serve in the ministry of the word. We must remember that preaching is not a simple matter; it is serving God's people with God's word. May the Lord be merciful to us. Because our whole being is involved with the word, any unsuitable elements in our thoughts, expression, and attitudes, and any shortcoming in our training and experience will unconsciously damage His word. Our very being must be dealt with by the Lord. If we are dealt with by the Lord, His word will not suffer our contamination when we serve as His ministers. We will be able to release His word in a pure way. We can see this in Paul, Peter, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and we can see this in many servants of the Lord. Human elements are present in God's word. But while human elements are present, they do not express the flesh. On the contrary, one finds glory in its expression. This is amazing&mdash;God's word becomes man's word, and man's word becomes God's word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
