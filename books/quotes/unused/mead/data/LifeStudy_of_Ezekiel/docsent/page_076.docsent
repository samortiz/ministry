   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE DRY BONES, THE TWO STICKS, AND THE ARMY Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>37:1, 5-17, 21-28</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Ezekiel has four main sections, each of which contains one crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section, consisting of chapter one, speaks of the glorious vision of God and reveals the holy God in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second section, composed of chapters two through thirty-two, speaks of God s judgment to deal with all things and matters that do not match His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God judges everything among Israel and among the Gentiles that is incompatible with His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third section, which includes chapters thirty-three through thirty-nine, concerns God s recovery of a remnant of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God comes in to judge, He remembers His covenant of grace, and thus He preserves a group of His elect and brings them back to their own land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that the main idea in the third section of Ezekiel is the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fourth section, consisting of chapters forty through forty-eight, speaks about God coming to build His beloved recovered people into His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the last section is devoted to the matter of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Ezekiel, there are three chapters which may be considered great chapters in the Bible chapter one, chapter thirty-seven, and chapter forty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These chapters occupy a special position not only in Ezekiel but in the Bible as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each of these chapters may be represented by a single word: chapter one fire; chapter thirty-seven breath; and chapter forty-seven water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No chapter speaks of God as fire in the way Ezekiel 1 does.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 4 and 7 and Revelation 22 speak about water, but not in the way that Ezekiel 47 does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, Ezekiel 37 is unique in the way it speaks of God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This chapter reveals how God s Spirit comes into us in order to enliven us that we may become a corporate body, formed into an army, and also built up as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only in this chapter do we see the result of our being enlivened by the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this we see that Ezekiel 37 occupies a particular position in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapters thirty-three through thirty-seven of Ezekiel describe God s recovery of His people from different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter thirty-four emphasizes the Lord s coming as a Shepherd to seek His lost sheep and to bring them back to their own land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter thirty-six we see that the Lord recovers His people by life not only outwardly but also inwardly, by giving them a new heart and a new spirit and by putting His Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapter thirty-seven reveals that the Lord comes to revive His dead and scattered people and to make them one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From this we see that God s captured people needed to be recovered in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because they had been driven away and scattered like sheep, they needed the Lord to search for them as their Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because their inward condition was unclean and old, they needed a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because they had become dead, dry bones, they needed to be enlivened and joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE PLANT OF RENOWN AND THE GARDEN OF EDEN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we begin to consider chapter thirty-seven, I would like to say a word about two matters the plant of renown 34:29 and the garden of Eden 36:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The plant of renown, a famous plant, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is not only the good land, containing many trees whose fruits are good for food; Christ is also a plant of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the expression like the garden of Eden , we need to see that eventually the Lord s recovery should come to the point where it is like the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then wherever we may be in the Lord s recovery, we will be in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Frequently in the meetings of the local churches we have the sense that we are in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the garden of Eden we have Christ as a famous plant, the plant of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that in the church life we enjoy the riches of Christ in a special way day by day.</S>
