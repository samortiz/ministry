Although the Epistles of Paul cover many matters, they do not adequately deal with the fellowship of God&#8217;s family.<h2 class=head1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>First John 1:1-3 says, &#8220;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Word of life is the Son of God, Christ Himself, as in John 1:1, and the fellowship in 1 John 1:3 comes out of this eternal life.<p>The fellowship of God&#8217;s children is not only a fellowship between themselves but also one between the children and the Father. This fellowship issues from the divine life, which is Christ Himself. Fellowship is the divine life flowing and living within us. The current of electricity is electricity itself flowing, and the circulation of blood in our body is the blood itself circulating and flowing. In the same way, when Christ constantly lives, works, and flows within us, we have the fellowship of the divine life.<p>This divine fellowship is between us and the Father and also between us and all the members of the Body. In our physical body there is only one circulation of the blood. Although there are hundreds of members, the circulation of the blood is one. The circulation of the blood illustrates the fellowship of Christ as our life. We are the many members of Christ&#8217;s Body, yet we have one fellowship in Christ as our life. The more we remain in Christ, the more we have this fellowship.<h2 class=head2>Maintained by the Cleansing of the Blood of Jesus</h2><p>This fellowship can be maintained by two things. On the negative side it is maintained by the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, while on the positive side it is maintained by the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Verses 5 to 7 say, &#8220;And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&#8221; Although sin interrupts, frustrates, and damages the fellowship, the blood of Christ deals with sin to maintain and sustain our fellowship.<p>In the typology of the Old Testament, when anyone contacted God or anything was brought to God, there was always the need of the sprinkling of the blood and the anointing. Anything that was brought into the presence of God needed to be sprinkled with the blood. Then based upon the sprinkling, it was anointed. The sprinkling typifies the cleansing of the blood of Christ, and the anointing typifies the moving and working of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the fellowship of the divine life between us and God is always maintained by the cleansing blood and by the moving, anointing Holy Spirit.<p>While we are in the divine fellowship, we are in the light. Then as we are in the light, we see how sinful and dirty we are. Spontaneously we need the cleansing of the blood. If we neglect the cleansing of the blood, our conscience will be full of accusations and offenses. However, by the cleansing of the blood our conscience is void of offense; we have a pure conscience without any accusations. Our conscience is always kept pure and without any offense not by our own self-perfection but by the cleansing of the blood of Christ. As a result, our conscience is at peace to fellowship with the Lord.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
