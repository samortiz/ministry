   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 10:28 says, "They shall by no means perish forever."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that those believers who commit sins and do not repent will temporarily suffer what the unbelievers will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They will be released when the official criminals arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Catholic purgatory begins with a person's death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, they have the teaching of the so-called release of the soul from suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Reference to this heresy should not be made to oppose the matter that Christians will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can only use the Bible to prove that the punishment is at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin in a Gentile is sin; sin in a believer also is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mr. Govett translated Raca as "useless"; others, as "stupid" or "good-for-nothing." Some say that the word Moreh is Syriac and that a more proper translation is "rebel." According to the context, it is more serious to call one's brother "Raca" than to be angry with one's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While to be angry is merely within one's heart, to call others "Raca" involves the using of one's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The punishment for one who calls his brother "Moreh" is that he will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may thus see that the meaning of Moreh is stronger than that of Raca.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Raca means "stupid," whereas Moreh, as Mr. Pember said, means "rebel." "The Gehenna of fire" is mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that Christians cannot escape judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this referred to unbelievers, would they go to hell simply because they scold a person for being stupid?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 23:"Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you..."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Therefore" means "for this reason."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here it does not say "offering your sacrifice" but "offering your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The offering of a sacrifice is for dealing with sin, whereas the offering of a gift is to give something to God and has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Has something against you" indicates that you have done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 24:"Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The requirement in this verse is many times higher than that in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only the gift and the person should be right, but also the spiritual condition should be right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord spoke these words, the ceremonial law had not been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Offer your gift" and "before the altar" were the background at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 25:"Opponent at law" in Greek means "plaintiff"; "opponent" implies enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"On the way" means that you have not reached the end of the way and have not arrived before the judge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, be well disposed quickly toward your opponent for the following three reasons: 1 He may die.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he dies, there is no possibility for reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 You may die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once you die, there is also no possibility for reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 The Lord may come back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the Lord comes back, there is no possibility for reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you mistreat someone and do not deal with it properly, even the sound of his sighing can prevent your prayer from reaching God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The voice of Abel caused Cain to be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The judge" refers to the Lord; "the officer" refers to the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The "prison" is a place where there is no freedom and a place of darkness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One who is put into prison cannot live glorious days; he cannot be like those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, since this is the prison, this is not forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may thus see that there is still the possibility for Christians to be put in the Gehenna of fire in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 26:"You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the debt has to be paid back sooner or later, why not pay it back today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here, "come out" will take place in the coming age, that is, the age of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This refers to the forgiveness in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 27-32:This section is on adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 28, " looks" indicates that it is intentional; "a woman" refers to another's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is condemned by Christ is not any sudden thought put into us by Satan or any sudden evil thought that came up in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, what is condemned is that after seeing, we look with intention.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Any action that our will disagrees with is not counted as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the action of our will after we surrender to temptation is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord teaches us here that we must guard our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, we would surely commit adultery if it were not for reasons of ethics, environment, or position.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is written in Proverbs, "He that hath no rule over his own spirit / is like a city that is broken down, and without walls" 25:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A city without walls is a place where the enemy can go in and out freely.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 29:Unbelievers still have to go to hell even if they pluck out their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, this word here is not spoken to unbelievers but to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 30:Both the cutting off of the hand in this verse and the plucking out of the eye in the preceding verse are not to be taken literally.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, what is meant here is to cut off the opportunities for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter once cut off someone's ear with his hand, but his hand was not cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that we should pay any price to cut off the opportunities for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verses 31-32:Here the Lord puts the matter of divorce altogether in a new position.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord acknowledges that husband and wife are one body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before this one body is damaged, nothing can destroy this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Adultery destroys oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The certificate of divorce is only a recognition that the oneness has been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless the divorce is due to adultery, the oneness still exists before God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the wife marries someone else, that means the husband causes her to destroy the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He also causes the man who marries her to be guilty of destroying the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, if the husband himself marries another woman, he also commits adultery.</S>
