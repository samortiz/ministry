   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BRINGING IN THE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Austin-Sparks did not know this when he came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He left Taiwan in March and arrived in London in April.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In May he wrote an article for his magazine in which he praised us, saying, For many days I spoke to more than five hundred select Christian workers during the day and to about two thousand believers at night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we visited churches for several days, and everyone we met was zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their faces were shining, waiting to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They devoured every word we spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He gave us a top compliment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, I would like to ask Brother Austin-Sparks if he knows the main reason for the success of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps many would think that the main reason is the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We agree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, why would the Holy Spirit not bless the work on other grounds?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that Brother Austin-Sparks met many Western missionaries and people from other groups when he was in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They all labored zealously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have more resources than we have and are more talented than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some among them are even better educated than we are and have higher reputations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why did Brother Austin-Sparks not praise their work?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why does the Holy Spirit not do a work among them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are clear that if we have any result that is worthy of praise, it is because we have not reconciled with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If from 1949 we had worked in reconciliation with the denominations, we would not have had the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main reason that our work can be praised is that we have the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regrettably, Brother Austin-Sparks saw the result, but he did not see the reason for the result.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE GROUND OF LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING THE BASIS FOR OUR EXISTENCE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realize that Brother Austin-Sparks adjusted us because of his care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not have bad intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, he was like a doctor who gave the wrong diagnosis; what he perceived as a sickness is actually our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The local ground is not a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this item is removed, we cannot live any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This can be compared to a person who drinks tea and then breaks the teapot.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He does not realize that the teapot is needed to brew more tea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tea depends on the teapot for its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blessing we experience is because we stand on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We depend on the ground for our existence; we are being upheld by the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if we allow others to take away our ground, our teapot, not only will the teapot they hate disappear, but the tea they love will also vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, it is not a matter of whether one has a good or a bad intention; we never doubted Brother Austin-Sparks intention.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He cared for us out of a pure and fervent heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We treasured this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the ground is a matter of light, not of a personal view.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fellowship is so that we may be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we ignore this fellowship, history will be repeated, and there will not be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>RECEIVING OTHERS WITHOUT DAMAGING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE LORD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Over the past two thousand years God has raised up many useful ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In America there are ministries that are strong in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is great, and He has raised up many spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Austin-Sparks is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Brother Austin-Sparks stands on a ground that is close to the local ground, he is not on the local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There have been many who have had such a stand in history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some, who do not stand on the local ground, have received more revelation from the Bible than we have.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are happy to receive the supply from them because these are the riches that God has given to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even some who were in Catholicism, such as Madame Guyon and Brother Lawrence, were people with much spiritual weight and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should receive the spiritual supply from all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the same time, however, we should be very clear that the Lord raised us up for the testimony of the one Body so that there will be an expression of a built-up representation in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not demanding that all the brothers and sisters have this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we would ask all the co-workers, whether brothers or sisters, to try their best to minister in the gospel and in the truth and not to touch or destroy the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they are willing to cooperate, there will be no problems; however, if they touch or destroy the ground, they will cause much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May the Lord grant us grace to become clearer concerning these messages as we go on.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be clear concerning where we are, and we should be humble to receive what can benefit us in the gospel, the truth, and the spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we must be absolutely clear related to the testimony the Lord wants us to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should guard this testimony securely.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not be foolish guarding the vision yet not standing on the ground; neither should we guard the ground and reject the spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are clear concerning this point, we will be able to help those who come in contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We receive the spiritual supply from others, and we also render them the help.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should receive help from others in humility, and we should also know our testimony and our ground.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should always render some help to others when we contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not speak of things that will not edify them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is to do all things for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not shrink from speaking whatever is beneficial to them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we can help others in this way without forsaking our stand, the Lord s testimony will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should receive Brother Austin-Sparks portion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The problem was that Brother Austin-Sparks overstepped his portion and damaged us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Moreover, the problem was enlarged because some of our brothers were not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If Brother Austin-Sparks had not overstepped his portion, there would not have been problems.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Likewise, if our brothers were all clear, there would not have been problems even though Brother Austin-Sparks had overstepped.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, the key is for us to be clear concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are clear, no one can easily sway us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>People can say whatever they desire, and we will not waver.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We still have a normal relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks; it has not been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What we are stressing is that it is difficult for us to accept what differs from us in the matter of the ground and in the matter of the light of this truth, because the ground is our very life, and it affects our testimony.</S>
