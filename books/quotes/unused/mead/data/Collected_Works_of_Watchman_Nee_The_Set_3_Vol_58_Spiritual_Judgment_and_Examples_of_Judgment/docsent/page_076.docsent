   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 55 Date:September 7, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER S. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through my sister's death, God turned me to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time I was not clear about salvation, but I felt that I was different inside.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time I confessed my sins to the Lord, my heart was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After I believed in the Lord, I began to study the Bible and was interested in attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1928 I worked at the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later I did not have the peace to stay there, and in 1937 I quit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The pastor in the C.I.M. Church rebuked me, saying, "You want to follow Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is not our Hudson Taylor just as good?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That pastor had loved me very much, but after I resigned, he treated me like an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1941 the meetings in various places in Chekiang were going on well, and the Lord heard many of our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later the condition of the church turned for the worse, and I began to bear more responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I wanted to resign and ask God to raise up others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I could not drop the work, yet I could not advance in any way either.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was a painful experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I found that there was a training in Kuling, but I was not a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later one brother recommended me; he knew that my spiritual condition needed this training, and I was granted permission by Brother Nee to come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In looking back at my work, I find that I have come short of the Lord in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have repented in tears, and the Lord has granted me mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I am rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not know what the way ahead of me is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord speak to me through our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our brother needs to learn more lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than this one need, he has no great problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His pathway is straight, and his spirit is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But he is short of some basic dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is right for you to feel that the responsibilities in the church are too great.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would like to point out that your measure of service is determined by the amount of training you have received in the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the things you spoke of, including the services you have taken up in the church and your obedience to the truth, are all commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you have to learn some personal lessons as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A worker must learn obedience not only to the truth in the church or in the work; he must also learn to submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit's discipline is God's building work, which He carries out through a man's personal environment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should be like Paul, who learned his lessons through his many afflictions and who was able to comfort those who were in every affliction 2 Cor 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some learn their lessons through biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others learn them through the environment that the Spirit orders for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man who has totally committed himself to God will find Him to be unrelenting; he will find God operating on him through the permitted environment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have said many times that it is a pity so many people have not learned their lessons through God's arranged environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to hand ourselves over to the Holy Spirit and yield to His arrangements in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should learn what we need to learn and not waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not you are rich depends on the kind of lessons you have learned in your ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more you learn, the richer you will be in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are not that rich, you will only be able to lead others according to the biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some are able to guide and help others with the things that they have learned from the Lord through the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A person who has experienced much discipline from the Spirit should be richer than others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But I know of many brothers and sisters who have not learned much, even though they have experienced much discipline of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I know of one sister in Shanghai who was stumbled every time she was disciplined by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such ones are like broken vessels littered in a pottery factory; no new vessel is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the discipline of the Spirit is shallow, the earthen vessel of these ones remains intact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as soon as the discipline of the Spirit becomes stronger, their earthen vessel breaks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord lead you to beseech Him every day to learn something through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to differentiate between the way of guidance according to the teaching of truth and the way of guidance according to the discipline of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some have not obeyed the truth, yet they have obeyed the discipline of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others have not obeyed the discipline of the Spirit, yet they have obeyed the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is the need for a balance between these two kinds of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One cannot neglect either kind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a worker applies himself to his work, he has to know whether or not the brothers and sisters are balanced in these two aspects in their daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am saying this to those children of God who have learned some lessons in the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a man comes to us, we should know whether or not he is balanced in these two kinds of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many brothers and sisters have learned good lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but they are short in their obedience to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot be short in either aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must have the proper balance so that God's pathway will be straight before us.</S>
