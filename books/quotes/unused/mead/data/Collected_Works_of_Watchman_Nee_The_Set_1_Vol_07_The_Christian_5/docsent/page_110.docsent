   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Issue No. 20 INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"WORSHIPPING GOD"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Worship is an art that is long lost among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are very few people who know the meaning of the word worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are fewer who know how to worship God in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is one reason for the degeneration of spiritual life among believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most important work in the spiritual life is to contact God and to fellowship with God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This contact and fellowship with God has its highest expression in worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is when believers become mature in life that they know how to worship God as God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another great reason for worshipping God is to worship Him for what He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recently, the Lord has been pleased to see men in China preaching the importance of worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This special issue that meets this timely demand should receive the greatest attention from the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May God guide those who are willing to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Issue No. 24 A LETTER FROM THE EDITOR TO THE READERS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The content of this letter describes the major changes for next year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We urge the readers to read this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this issue reaches you, it will be the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Looking over the past year, we really thank Him for the way He has blessed us, led us, taught us, supplied us, urged us, healed us, rebuked us, chastened us, and disciplined us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord, Oh my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again considering ourselves in this past year as being so defiled, defeated, head-strong willful , rebellious, ungracious, unrighteous, lacking, and wrongful, we feel thoroughly discontented with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How we wish that these dark spots were not part of the history of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But wishing is wishing; still we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, knowing our condition only convinces us more that our flesh is incurable and causes us to loudly sing praises to the Lord, for in such defeat He is still so gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we forget Your grace?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that my ill health during this past year was known far and wide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In three localities it was even rumored that my earthly tabernacle had been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason there were increased prayers for me more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I greatly appreciate those who care for my physical welfare.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past days my natural strength has been much weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even light activity causes my body to feel its burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But praise the Lord that this year was still filled with many days of work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of resting and getting rusty, why not labor and trust?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The strength of promise in time of need is never decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this fact I cannot but praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The scarcity of fruit, the emptiness of life, the staleness of the spirit, and the weakness of the body are each enough to make me feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, I deserve nothing but to be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That all things work together for good to them that love God is true and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In my situation these words again have become so real.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After a long period of waiting and praying, I am now clear about the Lord's will concerning The Christian for next year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I first began publication of this paper, I knew it would not be of a permanent nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At first I intended to publish it only on a trial basis for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Following the first year, I continued its publication for another year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now two full years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I began, a few friends asked, "What is your purpose in publishing The Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What do you plan to do with The Present Testimony which you published before?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My answer was, "The goal of The Christian is to lead believers to read The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever I feel the time has come, I will stop publishing The Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was what I said to my friends then.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the time has come, and The Christian will be discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This whole year I have been continually before God, contemplating and praying over the future of this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Day by day I have become clearer that the message of this paper is now adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is now leading me on to bear another special testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As this instrument has been used in the hand of God, and as He now desires to put it aside, who am I that I should say no?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some friends who learned of my decision felt sorry that The Christian was being discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also, humanly speaking, it seems that since this paper is enjoying such a wide circulation, that it is a shame to discontinue it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to my natural thought, I also am reluctant to discontinue The Christian, for I am most delighted with such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God has stepped on the brake, and I must obey with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In that day you will know that I was obeying God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I feel deeply that the various testimonies we have printed in The Christian, especially those concerning the outward behavior of believers, are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we continue our tiring reiteration, it will make The Christian a paper specializing in "leaving the denominations," "baptism by immersion," etc. I thank God that He gave the co-workers and me the same feeling concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some readers still have many questions that are still with me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not know now how the Lord wants me to spend my time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, I dare not promise to answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I had the thought once to put together the questions answered during the past two years plus the hundred or so questions I have at hand now and make them into a book for future reference.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But I do not have the confidence that this is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, I can only wait.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As for those who have paid for more than we have published, we will send a separate letter to communicate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We hope that those readers will watch for such announcements.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For those whose subscription will expire after this issue, we will not send additional letters to inform them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Does this mean that we will cease printing such writings concerning our testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord is leading the believers meeting in Shanghai to publish The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Henceforth, The Present Testimony will be a written testimony of the believers who meet and have fellowship in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible contains numerous teachings that ordinary believers cannot fully understand.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moreover, the testimony of the Lord is so incomparably great that we cannot receive and preach it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During the time of my waiting and praying, God committed to me the testimony which He wishes me personally to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I consider the book The Spiritual Man to be an outline of the special testimony which the Lord has committed to me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the past years, day by day the hand of the Lord has become heavier upon me, forcing me to realize that He desires me to bear a special testimony for His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are many who have ordinary testimonies, but the Lord wants me to bear a special testimony for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, I am ready to give up the work of expounding the Scriptures, which thing I would like to do most, in order that I might bear the specific testimony that God has freshly committed to me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The wonderful thing about it is that the Lord is also leading all the brothers and sisters who are meeting and having fellowship in Shanghai in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, by means of the coming issues of The Present Testimony, according to what we have received from God, we shall specifically explain "the deep things of God" to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We wholeheartedly desire to bear this unique testimony that the Lord has committed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We also fully realize that the Lord will raise up many other believers besides us to bear this testimony together.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we walk on the spiritual path, the more we realize the importance of the message of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Believers today have failed because they have not allowed the cross to work deeply and destroy all the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is still a mixture of the new and the old creation in the lives of believers, because the old creation has not yet been replaced by God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Such mixture always results in loss to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Correctness in outward behavior, excellence in church organization, increase in Bible knowledge, and exertion in God's work are all insufficient to guarantee against a mixture of the flesh within.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>On the contrary, the flesh can act freely in all these things and promote them with all its might.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For this reason, the work of the cross annihilating the old creation is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Without the cross standing between the new and the old creations, a person's spiritual life is false, shallow, and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since a believer's life is always related to both "self" and the Lord, the cross must destroy the self so that the Lord can have His legitimate place.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The time of the millennium will be the right time for the Lord to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Therefore, by the grace of the Lord, we would remind the church of God that the Body of Christ must rise up to work with Him to bring in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our desire is that the enemy might soon be put to shame and that Christ might soon be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Because many believers today are limited by their financial means, we desire to see them receive the gospel without a price.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In addition, the Lord Jesus' coming is near; if we have received subscription fees from others and we are raptured and no magazine is received by them, it will become an unsettled matter.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Hence, we feel that it is better that we do not charge anything for this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>For this reason, The Present Testimony will be completely free.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The readers can support all publication needs according to their strength and the Lord's leading and help.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In this way, those who have abundance among us will have a way to help those who are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We ask that the Lord would loose the purse of the believers, and we at the same time ask the Lord not to allow the misers to send in their money.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is almost the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Next year is now within sight.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I once again am conscious of my own corruption, weakness, defilements, and my inability to meet the great responsibility that God has entrusted to me.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>At the same time, I am emboldened by His love, faithfulness, and wisdom, and I deeply realize that everything is His and that He bears all things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May God lead us on in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Watchman Nee</S>
