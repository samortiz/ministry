   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR UNIQUE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am burdened that we must not regard Paul s word in 3:8 and 9 as mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to consider seriously before the Lord just where we are right now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are we in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the angels and demons observe us, do they find us in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When others meet us, where do they find us in Christ or in some good thing that is not Christ Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s word about being found in Christ is of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Deep within Paul was the aspiration to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May we all aspire to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to pray, Lord, my desire is to be found in You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In everything I do day by day, I want to be found in You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I doubt that many of us have prayed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul could say that he counted all things as refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a very important statement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All that he says in verses 5 through 7 help him to reveal his aspiration expressed in verses 8 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us pray that we may be found in Christ by our wife or husband, by our children and relatives, and by our neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are truly found in Christ, all other things will lose their hold on us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall no longer be under the influence of religion, philosophy, or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How marvelous to be found only in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are found in Him, religion, philosophy, and culture are annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be found in Christ means that He is our unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Paul could be found in Christ, Christ was his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every aspect and from every angle, only Christ could be seen upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s aspiration was that Christ would be his only expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not want to be found in such natural virtues as humility, patience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These were among the things that he counted refuse, trash, in order to gain Christ and be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Culture, human patience, natural love, and submission all are refuse when compared to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not aspire to be found in our own love for others or in our natural submission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our earnest desire should be to be found only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE STANDARD OF GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The standard of God s salvation is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul refers to this salvation when he says, I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation here is Christ Himself, the very Christ in whom we may be found by others and even by angels and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we see the high standard of God s salvation, we shall realize how desperately we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are far below His standard, for people can find us in many good things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these things belong to the six thousand years of human tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan, God s enemy, uses this tradition as a means to occupy us, to frustrate us, and to keep us from the higher and richer experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, in Philippians, a book on the experience of Christ according to God s high standard, Paul expresses the aspiration that we would experience Christ to such an extent that we may be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, we all need to bow down before the Lord and pray, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cause Paul s aspiration to become my aspiration also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O Lord, create in me the hunger and thirst to pursue after You that I may be found in You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don t want others to find me in anything other than Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I want to be a person wholly in You, and I want others to find me in You, May the Lord grant us mercy that we may be found in Him!</S>
