   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KIND OF CONSECRATION WE NEED TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see the vision of this upper-room consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may talk much about consecration, but this may be a consecration at the seashore, not a consecration in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yes, at the seashore you gave up something to follow the Lord Jesus, but you may not have yet come to the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of consecration do you have a consecration at the seashore or a consecration in the upper room?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The time in the upper room in Acts 1 was a turning time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was a time of the turning of an age, a time of the turning of a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The turn that took place at that time affected heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you know what the issue of that consecration in the upper room was?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That consecration issued in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church came out of the consecration, the dedication, of the one hundred twenty in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During those ten days in the upper room, everything was dedicated in a practical way and was dedicated at any cost at the cost of their forefathers' religion, at the cost of their country, at the cost of their relationships with neighbors and friends, at the cost of their relatives and families, and at the cost of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only thing they cared for was the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were "drunken" with this heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were "married" to this heavenly vision; their whole being was held by this heavenly vision; and they were beside themselves with this heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the kind of consecration we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PAYING THE PRICE FOR THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you seen the heavenly vision about which we have been speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have you seen the visions of Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that you have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Will you be able to stand before the Lord at the judgment seat and tell Him that you have not seen any of these visions?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely you have seen something concerning Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world, and thus you are without excuse in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some claim that they have not seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They say this because they are not willing to be in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, they are not willing to pay the price for the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They know that there is a cost to admitting that they have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They realize that all these visions are costly, but they are not willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regarding this matter of cost, or price, let us read the word of the Lord Jesus in Revelation 3:18: "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse the Lord counsels us not to pray nor to ask nor to receive nor to take by faith; He counsels us to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we are concerned only with the third of the three things which the Lord counsels us to buy eyesalve to anoint our eyes that we may see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps, in a sense, you have not seen the heavenly vision, but as soon as you are willing to pay the price, to buy the eyesalve, you will see.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The crucial matter is the willingness to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once you come into the upper room, everything is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if you are not willing to come into the upper room, no matter how many messages you hear, you still will not be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to buy the eyesalve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not excuse yourself by saying that you have not seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not say that you are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may be clear, but you may not be willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are not willing to pay the price, you will not dare to say that you have seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not you have seen the vision depends on this one matter whether you are willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Pay the price to buy the eyesalve and you will see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I encourage you to pray, saying, "Lord Jesus, by Your mercy I will buy the eyesalve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By Your mercy I am willing to pay the price to be in the upper room."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you say this to the Lord, the heavens will be opened, the scales will fall from your eyes, and you will see the heavenly vision.</S>
