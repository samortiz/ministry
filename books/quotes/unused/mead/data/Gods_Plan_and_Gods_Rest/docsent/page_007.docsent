   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To stop the enemy and the</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>avenger.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I see Your heavens,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the works of Your fingers,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moon and the stars,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>which You have ordained,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is man, that You</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>remember him,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the son of man, that You</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>visit him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have made him somewhat</S>
