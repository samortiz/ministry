   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Martin Luther</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When he was locked up in prison, he wrote a letter to one who was very powerful in the Roman church, saying, "Probably you may think that I am powerless now.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The emperor can easily prohibit the petition of a pitiable monk such as I. However, you have to know that I will surely fulfill the responsibility which the love of Christ has placed upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not the least afraid of the power of Hades, let alone the Pope and his bishops."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when he saw himself in the light of God, this bravest of all reformers could not help but cry: "I am more afraid of my own heart than of the Pope and all his bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within me there lies the biggest Pope the self!"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John Knox</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Scot, for the sake of Christ, was a teacher, evangelist, prisoner, slave, wanderer, reformer, and statesman; at the same time, he was a saint of the rarest kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In his very last prayer, he said: "This prayer is what I, John Knox, with my dying tongue and my whole mind, request of my God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this prayer, there are the following sentences:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord, have mercy on me, do not judge my innumerable sins; amongst them, may you forgive especially those sins which the world cannot reprove.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In my youth, my middle age, and until now, how much conflict have I passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have discovered that within me there is nothing besides falsehood and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O Lord, only You are the Lord who knows the secrets of man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please remember that of all the sins which I mentioned, not one of them is pleasing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I often grieve over them: they are deeply hated by my inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now I weep sorrowfully for my corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I can only rest simply in Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the prayer of a man who has been shined upon by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John Bunyan</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John Bunyan was put in prison for thirteen years because he wanted to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In prison he wrote the well- known book, Pilgrim's Progress.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Except for the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress may have the most translations in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spurgeon said of him, "In my view, the style of John Bunyan most resembles the style of the Lord Jesus; no man can come close to him."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when Bunyan wrote about himself, he said,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After my previous repentance, there is again one thing which makes me sad; that is, if I most severely examine the best thing I am now doing, in it I discover sins, new sins mingled in the best thing I do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore now, I cannot help but conclude that no matter how proud of myself and how idealistic I was concerning myself and my work, and even if my former living were without blemish, yet the sins that I commit in a day are enough to send me to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In such a deep feeling of sins, he cried out: "Unless He is such a great Savior, He surely cannot save such a great sinner as I."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>George Whitefield</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This extraordinary evangelist, who is as famous as John Wesley, when he was dying said:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, may I be able to lie down and die in the labor of my Lord, for I consider it worthwhile to die for this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I have a thousand bodies, every one of these bodies will be a wandering evangelist for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The last time he retired to rest, holding a candle, there was a big flock of people surrounding his doorway, asking him to preach to them once more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He knew that he was dying that day, yet he preached to them until the candle burned out, and then he went upstairs to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this man talked about himself, he said:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the fulfilling of all our responsibilities there is always corruption mixed within it; therefore, after our repentance, if Jesus Christ would only receive us according to our deeds; then our deeds would surely condemn us because we cannot offer a prayer which is as perfect as that required by the moral law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not know how you might think; but I can say that I cannot pray, I can only sin; I cannot preach to you or to others, I can only sin; I can only say this: even my repentance needs repenting again; even my tears need to be washed in the precious blood of my Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best deeds we have are but sins with spectacles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Augustus Toplady</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This very godly person, when he counted his sins, considered that every second he committed at least one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is to say that in ten years, there were more than three hundred million sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, he wrote that glorious hymn which caused millions of people, who were tired and oppressed by sin, to find rest "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee"!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He wrote:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, is there one as pitiable as I in this world!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Besides weakness and sin I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In my flesh there is no good thing, and how surprising that I could be tempted to view myself so high.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The best work I have done in my life only qualifies me to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when he was dying of tuberculosis in London, he leaned his sinful head on the breast of the Savior and said, "I am the happiest man in this world."</S>
