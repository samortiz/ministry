   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD INTENDS FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE OUR LIFE AND SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The new life and new power that God has given to us is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today Christ lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is He doing within us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is within us as our life, and He is within us to be with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said that He will not leave us as orphans John 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can say that the wretched man in Romans 7 is an orphan, and we can call Romans 7 a chapter about orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The man in Romans 7 had new demands and new desires, yet he could not meet these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was like an orphan hungry for food, but who was without food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The weather was cold and he needed clothing, yet he was without clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had to find all these things by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet even when he willed to have these things, he could not have them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord said that He would live within us and meet all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tonight I am not just preaching a Christ who has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not just preaching a crucified Christ but a Christ who is living in us, a Christ who supplies all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be satisfied with the Christ we knew in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 4 the Lord told the Samaritan woman, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the life in the Spirit which Christ gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life is a spring.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ does not give us something that can be contained in a bucket or exhausted in a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ supplies a spring within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can draw from it all the time "into eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It will not run out even when we see God face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is in us as our life, and He is supplying all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians say that they are saved, but their lives do not appear any different from those who are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have often joked that some Christians are "not quite saved."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not saying that they are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am saying that they do not appear to be quite saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that they have not reached the biblical definition of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can you say that you have Christ as your Shepherd and that you "shall not want"?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is Christ your Shepherd?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can you say that you have no want?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may have to confess that you have many wants.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you answer in this way, it proves that you need to know Christ in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christ mentioned in the Bible is One who can satisfy your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will make your heart thirsty again and again, yet He will satisfy your thirst again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I must say Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has given us a spring.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not like listening to a sermon once a week on Sunday and then running out of the supply for the other six days of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is a spring within us which wells up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Christian has no need of a bucket because there is a well within him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The water within many Christians seems to come from a bucket; it quickly runs out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Bible says that there is a spring within a Christian, which wells up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The source of supply in a tap is the reservoir; the supply is not from the house itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, the source of life of a Christian is Christ; it is not from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What a difference this is from the man in Romans 7, who wills and fails again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>GOD INTENDS FOR CHRIST TO BECOME OUR VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people think that they are too weak and that they have failed too often.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They ask God to strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They think that as long as they have the power, they can overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet even if they had the power, they could not overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are often amazed when they are overcome by their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in themselves can they do anything other than sin?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It should not be a surprise at all for them to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A Western missionary once said to me, "I sin often.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am sick of my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I cannot overcome no matter how hard I try.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My work in China has failed."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While I was listening, I was laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She asked, "Why are you laughing?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said, "You feel strange that you sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But I do not feel strange at all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To me this is most common.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I may be surprised if you committed greater sins, but I am not surprised that you are committing these kinds of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She said, "I have been preaching in China for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I know that God has called me, and I have experienced Him a little.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Yet I always fail.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How can I work any longer?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God has to give me the strength to overcome my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I said, "If you prayed for anything else, God might answer you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if you pray for God to give you the strength to overcome your sins, He will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will not give you the strength to overcome your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I told her that her mistake was in trying to mend the old creation with the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She was weak, and she asked for strength to overcome her sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yet the power of the new life, the power of God, is not given to us to sustain our old man or to empower it to overcome sins.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God never does this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to ask God to grant us new light and new revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need Him to show us that it is not a surprise for us to be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is absolutely right that we should overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The problem is that the human life will always remain the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This life does not have the power to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God has no intention for us to overcome sin with our human life, and He has no intention to sustain our old life with His power.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God intends for Christ to be our life, our strength, and our victory.</S>
