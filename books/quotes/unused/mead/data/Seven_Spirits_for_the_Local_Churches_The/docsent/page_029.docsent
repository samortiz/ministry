   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BABYLON BEING FALLEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The great Babylon is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not care for Christianity, we do not care for Christendom, we do not care for the Roman Catholic Church, and we do not care for all the denominations, because the Bible says that the great Babylon is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christianity is fallen, Christendom is fallen, Catholicism is fallen, and all the denominations are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And a second time they said, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns 19:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Babylon has been judged, so all the servants of the Lord must say Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I like these words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, there is Amen, and then Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we began to use the four words, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, I thought that perhaps we had put these words in the wrong order.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But later I found that this is the order in the Bible Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Amen, Hallelujah for what?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is for the judgment of Christendom, the judgment of the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not believe the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sooner or later, we will see it fall, and in the eyes of God it is fallen already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not believe the present situation of today s Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is all a lie, and in the eyes of God it is already judged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to say Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not pray, O Lord, the war; Lord, the riots; Lord, the distresses; Lord, how prevailing is Catholicism; Lord, O Lord, do something Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then what do we need to say?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 19:7 says, Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can just shout and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we pray in a poor way, Satan will clap his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Lord would say, I have done everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What are you praying like that for?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Didn t I tell you that Babylon is fallen?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you need to pray in such a poor way?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All you have to do is rejoice and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So we must say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation 20:10 says that the devil was not only cast out of heaven but cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Have you seen it?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must say that Brother John saw it, and I see it too!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan was cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only Satan but also death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire v. 14 . The devil, death, and Hades, these three awful things, all were cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So we must say Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do we need to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No, we must praise and rejoice because we have seen the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE HOLY CITY</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After all the negative things, in Revelation 21:2 we see the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John saw the holy city, the bride prepared and adorned as a bride for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not care for today s situation of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes many bad reports come, but I do not care because I have Revelation 21:2.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Oh, the bride, the adornment, and the preparation!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the eyes of God one thousand years are just as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the eyes of God everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>John saw the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>THEY HAVE COME TO PASS</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He said to me, They have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely v. 6 . When the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He said, It is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But now on the throne He says, They have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As to redemption, it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As to God s eternal purpose, it has come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do we need to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then what must we do?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do we need to say that the church is so miserable and so muddy?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do we have to ask, beg, and wait on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>No, we must rejoice and shout and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How many books do you have in your Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do you have sixty-six books?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then have you read the last one?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>On the cross it was written, It is finished, but in Revelation it is also written, They have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They have come to pass!</S>

   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Lord says, I come quickly.</S>
