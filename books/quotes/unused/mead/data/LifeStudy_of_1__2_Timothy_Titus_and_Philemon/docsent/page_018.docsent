   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE FIVE OVERSEERS AND DEACONS FOR THE CHURCH'S ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:1-13 Paul speaks of overseers and deacons for the church's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 1 through 7 he covers the overseers, and in verses 8 through 13, the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. OVERSEERS A. Aspiration for Oversight</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 1 Paul says, "Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul begins with the expression, "Faithful is the word."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This expression indicates that what he is about to say is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 1 Paul speaks of oversight, and in verse 2, of overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word rendered oversight is episkope, from epi meaning over and skope meaning sight; hence, oversight, denoting the function of an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word translated overseer is episkopos from epi and skopos meaning seer; hence, overseer bishop, from Latin episcopus .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An overseer in a local church is an elder Acts 20:17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; and overseer, denoting the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 1 Paul tells us that if anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Aspiration with a pure motive differs from ambition with an impure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the Lord's desire that many brothers have the aspiration spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the Lord's recovery and for the building up of the local churches, there is the need of the proper leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, aspiration for oversight is not only justifiable, but even admirable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, we condemn ambition; on the other hand, we appreciate the fact that many brothers have the aspiration for oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A brother with this kind of aspiration truly desires a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. Qualifications of an Overseer 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without Reproach</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 2 Paul says, "The overseer then must be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul first mentions the qualification of being without reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not denote perfection in the eyes of God, but an irreproachable condition in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An overseer must be one with a good reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There should be no ground for others to speak evil of him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Husband of One Wife</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An overseer should be the husband of one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This implies the restraint of the flesh, which is necessary for an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It keeps an elder in a simple and pure married life, free from the tangle of a complicated and confused marriage.</S>
