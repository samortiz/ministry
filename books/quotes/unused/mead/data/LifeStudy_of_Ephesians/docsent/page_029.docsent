   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINE TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall give a further word on the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:9 and 10 say, Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered unto at the beginning of verse 10 can also be rendered in order to have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, that portion can be translated, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself in order to have a dispensation of the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The times refer to the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the new heaven and the new earth come after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed, that will be the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word dispensation is also found in 3:2, If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dispensation of the grace of God means the administration of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOD S ETERNAL PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to understand what the dispensation of the grace of God is, we need to see that in eternity past God purposed a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this plan, He created the universe with the heavens, the earth, and billions of items.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He then created mankind as the center of the universe to be a vessel to contain God for God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word is brief, but it covers the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man was created not to be an instrument, but a vessel to contain God so that God may be expressed from within man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is God s eternal plan, His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SATAN BRINGING DEATH TO GOD S CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His wisdom God allowed an archangel to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without God s permission, no rebellion could ever take place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not even the rebellion among the angels could happen without God s permission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God allowed one of His angels to rebel against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was according to God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan s rebellion serves in the same way as the black background of a painting that makes the main object all the more outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book of Genesis reveals that Satan came to inject himself into man, who was the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Satan injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever Satan comes to us or into our home, there is death and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result of this death and darkness is a collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person who is full of life can stand upright.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when the power of death has been injected into him, he falls down; he collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of being headed up, he collapses into a heap.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the entire universe, including mankind, is a heap of collapse caused by Satan injecting himself as the factor of death into God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan has brought death to the entire creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of creation has been infected by the death factor of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that Romans 8:20 and 21 say that the creation has been subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to inject a substance into a person s body, there is no need to inject it into every part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, the injection is made at a certain spot, and then the substance spreads throughout the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, Satan injected himself into man, the center of the universe, and from man Satan s poison has spread everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, not only is man subject to death, but also every living thing is subject to it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever any living thing dies, it collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The element of death has spread into every part of God s creation, causing the creation to collapse into a heap.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The collapse of the universe gives God an excellent opportunity to manifest His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without such a situation of death and collapse, God s wisdom could not be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the church God s manifold wisdom will be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The collapse caused by Satan s injection of the factor of death into man serves as the black background to make God s wisdom all the more glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan s way is always to act ahead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever God wants to do something, Satan acts first.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, the Bible reveals that God s intention is to build a city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the first city was a counterfeit one built by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, God s intention is to impart Himself into man and to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But before God did this, His enemy, Satan, came in to do a counterfeit work by injecting himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that God desired man to take Him in. God is never in a hurry; He is always willing to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan, on the contrary, is always in a rush.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to learn from this that anything that we do hurriedly is probably not of God, but of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before God dispensed Himself into man, Satan injected himself into man, the center of God s creation, and thereby caused the entire creation to collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now instead of life, there is death everywhere: in the offices, factories, businesses, schools, and even in the so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because death is everywhere and in everything, everything is in a state of collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the background of God s working Himself into man.</S>
