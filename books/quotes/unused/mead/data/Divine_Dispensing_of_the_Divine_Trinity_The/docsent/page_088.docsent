   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ITS ISSUE THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4-6, 13; 12:1-2, 5, 11; 16:1, 5a, 16b, 20 WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 8:4 Paul says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the word walk means to live, move, and have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This word indicates that we should do everything in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to have our being and our daily life according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bible translators realize that it is difficult to determine whether the spirit in 8:4, as well as in other verses in Romans 8, refers to the Holy Spirit or our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, in certain verses, such as 8:9 and 16, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are clearly designated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 8:4 the spirit refers to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, these two spirits have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have such a wonderful mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit and indwelt by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament we are charged to live, walk, and have our being according to this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently I gave a message in Chinese entitled Walk According to Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that message I pointed out that we need to do everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we truly live according to spirit, we shall not lose our temper, argue with our husband or wife, gossip, or murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I can testify that when I live according to spirit, I cannot argue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever we do, we should do according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should dress ourselves according to spirit and also have our hair cut according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His wisdom the Lord caused the Apostle Paul to tell us that if we walk according to spirit, the righteous requirement of the law will be fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of hundreds of commandments, Paul gives us a unique commandment to live, walk, and have our being according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose, for example, that you are tempted to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of trying to suppress your temper, simply live and walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that instead of trying to deal with your temper, you should live according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you walk according to spirit, the gopher of your temper will be dealt with automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the problem of your temper will be solved, not by your effort, but as the result of your living according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By walking according to spirit, we shall keep ourselves under the shower of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we do not walk according to spirit, we shall move away from the shower of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we walk according to spirit, the more we remain under the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 8:6 Paul goes on to say, For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know from experience that our mind is unruly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Within a short period of time, our thoughts can travel around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes this happens while we are sitting in a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the meeting is going on, in our mind we may travel from place to place and imagine all sorts of things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we surely need to set our mind upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that we can set our mind on our regenerated spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our spirit is no longer dead, for it has been enlivened by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 8:10 Paul tells us that our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our regenerated and enlivened spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we need to set our mind upon this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2 Timothy 1:7 Paul says, For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Continually we need to turn our mind to the spirit and set our mind upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can testify that it is a great protection for us to set our mind on our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will also help us to keep ourselves under the shower of the divine dispensing, and it will enable us to be victorious in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By setting our mind upon the spirit, we enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not take the matters of walking according to spirit and setting our mind on the spirit merely as doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As points of doctrine, these do not mean very much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to put these matters into practice in our daily living.</S>
