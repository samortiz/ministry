   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Sign Lameness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob was touched by God in the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, and his leg was crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when they experience it, they do not know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a few months or a few years God may show them that He was dealing with their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then they will realize that they have passed through such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that just because you are exuberant when you pray, your natural life has been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wrong to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our experience tells us that we do not know when God deals with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But one thing we do know: Whenever we are touched by the Lord, we are no longer free in our walk; we are no longer as convenient as before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a big mark in us lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lameness is a sign that our natural life has been touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of testifying in a certain meeting that God dealt with our natural life on a certain date.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a matter of our legs becoming crippled through some spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally, the more we contrived, the more we enjoyed our contriving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once we have been touched, something will vacillate within us when we contrive again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can no longer contrive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The minute we try, we lose our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Originally, we were so capable of speaking about this and that kind of thing; we had lofty words and high sounding phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But even before the words come out of our mouth now, we feel sick about them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can no longer be as glib as before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally we were shrewd and resourceful; we knew what to do about this person and what to do about that person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no need for us to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after God has touched our natural life, we will feel that something within is gone when we try to supplant others; something within us wilts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not saying that we should not act wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God often will lead us to do wise things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we try to exercise our own maneuvering, we will feel that something has collapsed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will feel this way before we even try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the hollow of our thigh has been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who have passed through God's dealings know the difference between natural strength and spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a person's natural strength is fully stripped, he will be afraid of the resurgence of his natural strength whenever he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that we will obtain a certain kind of result if we say a certain word, but we are afraid of reaping that result.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we go on according to our natural strength, we will feel cold inside, and something within us will refuse to go along.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the meaning of lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is also a difference in degree as to how much a person is touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are touched by God just to the extent that their conscience is bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some are touched by God in a thorough way; they are touched in the sinew of their thigh hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These people are the truly crippled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has to do a thorough work in us until a life-long mark is left on us, a mark of lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we become crippled, something will hurt us and frustrate us whenever we try to move or do something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the mark of being touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob Laying Hold of God</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jacob's thigh hollow was put out of joint when he wrestled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we see one amazing thing in verse 26: "And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to our thought, Jacob's thigh hollow was already out of joint, and he was depleted of all strength.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How could he not let God go?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the man said, "Let me go, for the day breaketh."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows that when the hollow of our thigh is touched, we hold on to God the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we cannot make it, we turn and grasp hold of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are weak, we become strong, and when we are crippled, we turn back to God and say, "I will not let You go."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To us, it seems impossible that we can do this, but this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When our strength is gone, we find ourselves grasping hold of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The grasping that happens when our strength is gone is the real grasping.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who grasp hold of God have no need of their own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The faith that accomplishes things is the faith that is as small as a mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains Matt 17:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times, fervent prayers and fervent faith are merely fervor; they do not bring about any result.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But often, when we do not have the strength in ourselves to seek God, when we cannot even pray to Him or ask of Him, and when we cannot even believe, we find ourselves believing!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The amazing thing is that this feeble faith, this little faith, brings in results.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Jacob was so strong, he was useless in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when the hollow of his thigh was touched, God took hold of him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He blessed Jacob saying, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel" Gen 32:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The name Israel means "ruling with God" or "reigning with God."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was the turning point in Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The experience at Peniel shows us that Jacob was defeated by God's hand; the sinew of his thigh's hollow was touched, and he became crippled for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Following this, however, God said, "As a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is true victory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we are defeated by God, we have truly prevailed and truly lost confidence in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever we find that we can no longer make it, that is the time when we have overcome.</S>
