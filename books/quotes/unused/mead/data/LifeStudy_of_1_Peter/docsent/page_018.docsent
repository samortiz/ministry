   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING A LIVING HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:1 and 2, we have the operation of the Triune God: the selection of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in the remainder of the first chapter we have the full salvation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This full salvation is composed of the Father s regeneration, the Spirit s application, and the Son s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father s regeneration has brought His eternal life into us and has also brought us into the enjoyment of this eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now this enjoyment is a living hope for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When some hear that we may enjoy the living hope today, they may argue and say, How can you claim that the living hope is a present matter?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something present can never be a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8 gives us a description of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That chapter tells us that hope refers to things that we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who would try to argue in this way need to realize that the living hope, the inheritance, is ours today, tomorrow, and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With our present enjoyment we have a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that our enjoyment of the divine life is a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, perhaps early in the day you may have a failure in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, even though you have failed, you still have a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may say to yourself, I m very weak, yet I still have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My experience may be poor, but I have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps even later today my experience will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you not have such a hope within you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have this living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day we live a life of living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason we have a life of hope is that we have a heavenly inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This hope, this inheritance, is the result of the Father s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 3 through 9 we see various aspects of the inheritance of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our enjoyment and experience of eternal life are due to the Father s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A recent experience I had with a stomach ulcer may be used to illustrate what Peter means by living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I discovered that I had a problem, I was hospitalized briefly for examination and tests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the examination and the tests were completed, I began to have a living hope every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I realized that within my body there is a life that could solve the problem of my ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This life caused me to have a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, I was fully healed and recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was recovered according to the living hope I had.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A living hope depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there were no life in our body, we would not have the hope to be healed of any illness or injury.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But because we have life in our body, we have the hope for it to be healed of injury or illness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We would not have such a hope for something that is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, suppose a wooden chair is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The chair does not have any hope of repairing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If no one comes to work on the chair to repair it, it will remain indefinitely broken without any hope of being fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when I was in the hospital, I could have a living hope because of the life in my body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I had the confidence that my physical life would heal the problem in my body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I had a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is a living hope?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A living hope is a hope that comes from life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This hope results from the living, organic element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to physical life, we also have the divine life in us through the Father s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This life is the strongest, richest, and highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be sure, this life will take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may have problems and troubles, but we have a living hope because of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are not dead we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we have a living hope, the hope that our situation will be better in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have eternal life, and this life gives us a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This hope is the inheritance of all the blessings of eternal life.</S>
