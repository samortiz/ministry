<p>Then we need to live a victorious life to overcome sin, to overcome the world, to overcome ourselves, to overcome our flesh, and even to overcome our quarreling with our spouse. The wives and the husbands among us may not be so one. Many couples may not have prayed together for three years. This is the situation that really needs a revival that we may live a victorious life. In each of the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the closing word is that we have to overcome (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 20-21). We need an overcoming life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD<br />
 DAILY AND HOURLY</h2>
<p>We also must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly (1 John 1:6; 2 Cor. 13:14). Even the angels should be able to testify that we are in the fellowship with the Lord. We should not be away from Him but present in His fellowship. There should be no absence in our fellowship with the Lord. Daily and even hourly we need to be such persons. If I were not such a person, it would be hard for me to speak in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. My speaking depends upon my continual and present fellowship with the Lord. Why can we not speak in the meetings? Maybe we have been absent from the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship for three days because we had a quarrel with our spouse. Because of this quarrel, we have been put away from the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship. If we are going to speak for the Lord, we have to recover our fellowship with Him by confessing our sin and by making an apology to our spouse. We must remain, abide, in the constant and continual fellowship with the Lord. This is a strong demand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A PRAYING PERSON</h2>
<p>We must also be praying persons. We should pray unceasingly all the day long. This means that we have to call on His name. We need to call, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; Do not think that such a short calling means nothing. It means a lot. While we are working in an office, teaching a class, or doing any task, we can call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Such a short calling means a lot to our Christian life. By calling on the name of the Lord, we can pray unceasingly. For us to be the speaking ones in our meetings we must be praying persons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE LORD IN THE WORD<br />
EARLY IN THE MORNING<br />
TO HAVE A NEW START OF EACH DAY</h2>
<p>We also must enjoy the Lord in the Word every day early in the morning to have a new start of each day (Psa. 119:147-148). According to God&rsquo;s principle in His creation, He ordained to have a new year, a new month or a new moon, and a new day. Within every year we can have three hundred sixty-five new starts. If we failed for three hundred sixty-four days, we still have one more opportunity to have a successful day. We may have failed today, but thank the Lord tomorrow is still here waiting for us. Tomorrow morning we will have another chance to have a new start. Within every twenty-four hours, there is a new chance for us to have a new start and be renewed.</p>
<p>To have a new start is not hard. It is so easy. Just rise up a little earlier and say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; You do not need to shout loudly to bother others. Just say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; To say this makes a big difference. Sometimes I forgot to call on the Lord immediately after I woke up. That became a big loss to me. As soon as I realized this I said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, forgive me for forgetting You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we need to pray-read a short portion of the Word, anywhere from two to four verses. We can enjoy the Lord with His Word and in His Word through pray-reading. We should do this every day in the morning to have a good, new start. We can speak the Word to ourselves, to the Lord, and even to the angels. We can speak the Word to our pets and even to our furniture. When we speak the Word in such a way, we will be the first ones nourished by our speaking. We do not need to spend a long time to enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning. Ten to fifteen minutes is sufficient to get nourished and have a good start of a new day. We need to practice this.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
