        <h2 class="head1">REVIEW OF SEEN AND HEARD (BIOGRAPHY NO. 1)<br />BY JAMES M'KENDRICK</h2><p>In preaching the gospel, one needs to exercise the gifts; however, he also needs to exercise his spirit. This means that there is the gift of preaching the gospel and the spirit of preaching the gospel. One who has the spirit of the gospel preaches in season and out of season. Only a few people are raised up every ten to twenty years in the history of the church who have the gift of the gospel. These people are few and far between. But everyone who loves the Lord can and should have the spirit of preaching the gospel. It is not limited to special gift.</p><p>I have read the biographies of many evangelists, including Finney, Moody, and Stanley. They all had the spirit of preaching the gospel and the gift of preaching the gospel. Their biographies can encourage us, but we cannot imitate them, because we do not have as great a gift as they did.</p><p>I particularly love this book Seen and Heard because we can say that Brother James M'Kendrick did not have the gift of preaching the gospel, but only the spirit of preaching the gospel. He was an ordinary man just like us. There was nothing special about him, but his heart was melted by the Lord's love, and he was extremely anxious for the needs of sinners. He could love, and he could cry. He could pray, and he could shout. The Lord's love was so strong in him that he was not able to refrain himself. Man's need made him restless day and night. As I read about him, I was often forced to weep with him. While Brother Yu Cheng-hua was translating this book, many times he also wept with him. M'Kendrick became a fool for the Lord's sake. He was beside himself that the gospel could go forth. Not all young brothers have the gift of preaching the gospel, but we must not lack the spirit of preaching the gospel. May this fire burn in us until we can no longer control ourselves. May this fire, because it consumes us, also consume sinners until they have no ground to refuse the Lord. May the fire of the gospel be ignited in China, first burning God's children and then sinners. Sinners will be saved in great numbers. If this fire does not burn us, it will not burn those in the world. The church can become the hindrance to man's salvation. O Lord, have mercy on the church! May the Lord have a way in the church so that He can gain access to the world. Fire! Fire! Let the fire of the gospel glow&mdash;first kindling us, and then setting the church ablaze.&mdash;Watchman Nee</p><p>(Published by the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai)</p><h2 class="head1">THE OPEN DOOR<br />(The Ministers is now combined into this paper.)</h2><p>NATURE: To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve problems related to the ministry.</p><p>FREQUENCY: We publish irregularly.</p><p>PRICES: We have no set price.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTIONS: All who wish to subscribe to this publication should clearly write down their name, address, and number of copies and send it to Distribution Department, The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai.</p><p>ATTENTION: 1) When subscribing, please write neatly and make sure the address is clear. 2) We ask those subscribers from different provinces to please include the name of their province. 3) When changing your address, your name must be the same as when you first subscribed. It is best if you can also send us the number from the wrapper of your copy.</p><p>WIRING MONEY: If God's children could help with the costs of publication according to the amount God has given them, we would be happy to accept it. If you are wiring money, please wire it to Gospel Book Room Distribution Department, 145 Nanyang Road, Shanghai. If you are wiring money through the post office, you will need to write our branch name. Please mark: Jingan Temple.</p><h2 class="head1">PLEASE SPEND A FEW MINUTES<br />TO READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE PUBLISHER</h2><p>1) We hope to continue the publication of The Christian and The Present Testimony. (The Way will be merged with The Christian, and The Testimony will be merged with The Present Testimony.) However, The Christian and The Present Testimony will be published irregularly and at a floating price. (There are no stock copies of back issues of either The Christian or The Present Testimony.)</p><p>2) Because the editors of The Christian and The Present Testimony are out with the work, we will be late in publishing them. Please forgive us.</p><p>3) There are still copies of the third issue of The Ministers and the second through fourth issues of The Testimony. Those who want copies should send us a letter. We will limit it to one copy per person until all have been given out.</p><p>The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai<br />September 1950</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
