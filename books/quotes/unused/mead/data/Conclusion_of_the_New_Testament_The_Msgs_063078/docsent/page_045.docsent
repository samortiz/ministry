   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Causing His Believers to Be Regenerated by God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His work in His resurrection Christ caused His believers to be regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God "has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we were resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the basic factor of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all received the human life from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because of God's choosing, the Spirit's sanctifying, and Christ's redeeming, God has begotten us, has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, we have had a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have been born of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through Christ's resurrection we have been regenerated by God unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word translated "unto" also means issuing in, resulting in, with a view to.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God the Father has regenerated us with a view to a living hope, the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything related to an unsaved person is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But with one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Adam we all died, but through the instrumentality of Christ's resurrection God has regenerated us, has enlivened us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were born with Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Dean Alford says, "The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth into a living hope."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The resurrection of Christ potentiates our regeneration into a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we were regenerated, the resurrected Christ entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not only the living One He is also the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every part of our being to become living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rising on the First Day of the Week to Germinate the New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another aspect of Christ's work in His resurrection is His rising on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 20:1 says, "On the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is significant that the Lord Jesus was resurrected not on the last day of the week but on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first day denotes a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible the first day of the week is also called the eighth day John 20:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a week of seven days, we have the eighth day, which is the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus died during one week, and He resurrected at the beginning of another week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was a new start opening the way to a new generation and a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the old creation there were seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God created for six days and rested on the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These seven days were the generation of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus another generation was newly started.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, by the resurrection of Christ the old creation has passed away and a new creation has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The old generation is over, and the new generation has started.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the first day of the week signifies the beginning of a new creation, a new generation, and a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fact that Christ arose on the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the sight of God the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then on the first day of the week there was a new beginning with Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whereas the Lord's death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that in resurrection we are in the eighth day, or the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Elsewhere, the New Testament calls the first day of the week the Lord's day Rev 1:10 , for it was on this day that the Lord Jesus was resurrected to become the living Lord and to usher in a new beginning in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Christ resurrected to germinate a new creation, He left the old creation, signified by the linen cloths and the handkerchief John 20:5-7 , in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before the body of Jesus was buried, it was bound in linen John 19:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that He went into the tomb with something of the old creation, signifying that the old creation was brought into the tomb by His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the things which were cast off from the Lord's resurrected body and left in His tomb signify the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ was crucified with the old creation and buried with it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But He resurrected from within it, leaving it in the tomb and becoming the firstfruit of the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the new creation, which consists of believers born again of God John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 , does have the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we are a new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 , not according to the old nature of flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life, it becomes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We, the believers in Christ, who have been germinated through His resurrection, are now the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The old creation does not have God in it, but the new creation begins by God coming into us in the way of germination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through this impartation of the divine life we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers for their regeneration to make them a new creation.</S>
