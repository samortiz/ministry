<h1 class="title">Becoming the Heavenly Bodies</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:10a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through her living in the ascension of Christ and further living within the veil, experiencing the cross of Christ more strongly, the lover of Christ becomes the heavenly bodies:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The overcoming believers can be luminaries as the moon reflecting the light of the sun in the church age (Phil. 2:15).</li>
	<li>The overcoming believers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom age (Matt. 13:43; Dan. 12:3).</li>
	<li>The people of God who produce the overcomers (the man-child) are clothed with the sun and have the moon underneath their feet (Rev. 12:1, 5).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The lover of Christ becoming the moon and the sun indicates that she has become not only wholly spiritual but also absolutely heavenly and signifies that she has become an overcomer:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Overcoming the attraction of the world by being captivated by Christ in the first stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the self which secluded her from the presence of Christ by becoming one with the cross of Christ in the second stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the old creation by living in the ascension of Christ in resurrection after her self was dealt with by the cross in the third stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the flesh, the natural man, the old man, by living within the veil.</li>
	</ol></li>
