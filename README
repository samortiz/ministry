========

Bibles, Hymn book, ministry books - All your ministry needs!

Bible : 
 - Several translations : KJV, ASV, Young's Literal, RcV w notes

 - A parsed greek translation (NA26) with lemmas


Hymns : 
 - The hymn book imported to a postgres database

 - Add verses and footnotes to specific lines of the hymn
 
 - Add chords to the hymn

 - Export to excel or chordpro


Books :
 - Lots of ministry books imported into tables and sorted according
   to their outline hierarchy.  

 - Search function for the books which adds weight to book titles
   chapter titles and section titles. 

 - Tables of Contents looked up and linked to the right pages


Installation :
 You can't really install this, your best bet is to just import the finished
 database. I didn't include all the raw data files in this repository.  

 This will require you to have a postgres database to import to.  The SQL
 will work with other databases, but the python expects the postgres lib
