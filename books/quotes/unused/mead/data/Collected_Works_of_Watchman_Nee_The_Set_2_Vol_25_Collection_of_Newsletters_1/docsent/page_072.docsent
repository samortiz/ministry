   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEGINNING AND EXPERIENCE OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN WENCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord because in these last days He has personally cared for us small ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1931 the Lord sent His servants to Wenchow to preach about the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This enlightened us in regard to the unscriptural nature of the forms and system of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there are quite a few believers in Wenchow, very few understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, a few brothers began a worship meeting in the South Gate China Inland Mission after they gained the light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They broke bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a few months, some who were not in one accord in the China Inland Mission rose up to oppose!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So we gathered a few of the brothers and sisters who were in one accord and met upstairs in a brother's house in Nan T'ang to worship and break bread in remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord; although there were only seven people, the savor among us was very sweet, because the Lord was with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a few months of meeting like this, those in the denomination outside the South Gate were afraid that an outward division would hinder the future development of their church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They had a meeting and exhorted us to meet together with them to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We saw that they had a heart for the Lord and thought that perhaps the Lord would raise up His work among them to revive His children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So we began to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the spring of 1932, a sister who lived on Chu Kuan Lane of Hsin Ho Street was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She was willing to let us use one of her apartments on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for Bible study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord also sent a worker to bear the responsibility for this Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the location was more than ten miles from our place in Nan T'ang, we felt satisfied every time we went to the meetings there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the Lord's Day we continued to go to the place outside the South Gate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In August or September, another small number of people in the denomination arose to oppose again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They said that the worship service was too long and that it was too much to break bread every Lord's Day!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time, we saw that they did not obey the truth, so we separated from them and established the Lord's table in Chu Kuan Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way we completely separated from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The enemy did not want us to meet peacefully, and by the spring of 1933, he began a great work among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A big problem occurred, and we could not continue meeting there lest we offend the Body of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time, the Lord sent His servant, Brother Lai, to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He knelt before the Lord with a few of us who were in one accord and asked the Lord to prepare a meeting place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord, in April we received what we asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We rented three two-story houses at 12 Sha Mao Ho Ta T'ing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Lai and one of the brothers in one accord lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our attendance at that time was low.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Lai took charge among us for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, we set the meeting times for Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Around November the Lord also sent His servant, Brother Wang Yu T'ing, to come with Brother Lai to meet with us for four days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were greatly edified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We really thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In April of this year, the Lord sent two other workers, Brothers Chen Chin Fa and Ts'ai Ch'i, to come meet with us for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They gave us much help.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During this time two brothers and one sister were baptized into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the Lord has gradually added a number of saved ones to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this time there are thirteen brothers and fourteen sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are over thirty people who meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently, the meetings are as follows: Every Tuesday, there is a Bible study; every Thursday, there is a perfecting meeting; every Saturday, there is a prayer meeting; on the Lord's Day morning we worship and break bread in remembrance of the Lord; on the Lord's Day afternoon, we preach the gospel, and in the evening, we learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord, through all the ups and downs, He has kept us until today so that we could faithfully follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have just mentioned something of the condition and the work that the Lord has raised up in our Wenchow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We ask the brothers and sisters in every place to thank the Lord for this and to pray for the work to come, that His will be done among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May glory, honor, blessing and thanks all be given to Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chang Ting Hsiang</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chang Tsai Kuang</S>
