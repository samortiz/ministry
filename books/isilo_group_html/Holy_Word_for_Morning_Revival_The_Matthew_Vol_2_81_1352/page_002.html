According to the examples in the Scriptures, leprosy results from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God&#8217;s deputy authority (Num. 12:1-10). Naaman&#8217;s leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience (2 Kings 5:1, 9-14). All fallen human beings have become leprous in the eyes of God because of their rebellion. The kingly Savior came to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy that they might become His kingdom people.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> According to the law, a leper was to be isolated from the people because of his uncleanness. No one was allowed to touch him (Lev. 13:45-46). But the new King, as a man and as the kingly Savior, touched this leper. What mercy and sympathy! By His one touch, his leprosy was immediately cleansed. What wonderful cleansing!</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal. Thus, he believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word. This was stronger faith, and it was marveled at by the Savior (v. 10).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In Matthew 8:1-17 three miracles-the cleansing of the leper, the healing of the paralyzed Gentile servant, and the healing of Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law-and the healing of many are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine, that is, they have a dispensational significance.</p><p>The diseases healed in the cases recorded in Matthew 8 are significant, for every disease signifies a specific spiritual sickness. The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper....The leper here represents the Jews. The Jews have become rebellious against God....Nevertheless, the heavenly King came...not to judge them, but to heal them....He came as a Physician to heal the sick [9:12].</p><p>The Jewish leper was healed by the King&#8217;s direct touch....But the centurion&#8217;s servant was...healed by the King&#8217;s word. The Gentile centurion believed in this word, and his servant was healed. The Jews are always saved through the King&#8217;s direct touch, but we Gentiles are saved...through believing the enlivening, regenerating word of the gospel. Hence, the centurion&#8217;s servant represents all the Gentile believers. The Lord did not commend the faith of the leper, because faith was not the outstanding characteristic there. The significant thing was the King&#8217;s touch. But with the healing of the centurion&#8217;s servant, faith is very outstanding. Hence, the Lord praised the centurion&#8217;s faith. Consequently, the servant was healed.
