<h1 class="title">PRAYER AND THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 21:13; Luke 1:8-9; 2:36-37; Eph. 5:18b-20; 6:18-19</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us that there is a great need to build up the priesthood so that the church can be built. Such a vision comes from the Lord&rsquo;s enlightenment. In this chapter we will consider several important points concerning the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD SAVING US TO BE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 1 and 5, the Lord purchased us for God by His blood out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation and thereby released us from our sins and made us a kingdom and priests to God (1:5-6; 5:9-10). The kingdom is a matter of authority. After we are saved, we are subject to God&rsquo;s authority, and we have His authority. With such a standing we can be His priests. According to the New Testament, as believers, we are priests to God. On the one hand, we are members of His household. On the other hand, we are in His kingdom; hence, we are under His authority and represent His authority. We are also priests in His temple, His dwelling place. First Peter 2:5 says that we are living stones and are being built up as God&rsquo;s spiritual house, His dwelling place, and as a holy priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The church is a corporate body of priests. Many saints understand that the church is composed of all the saints. Now we must go further and see that the saints in the church are a coordinated body of priests, a priesthood. The priesthood is the built-up church. In the Old Testament the tabernacle consisted of furniture, and the priests who served in the tabernacle were a group of people. The priests and the tabernacle were intimately related, but they were separate. This is no longer true in the New Testament. In the New Testament age, the tabernacle and the priests are one. God&rsquo;s priests are His tabernacle, His dwelling place. This dwelling place, the built-up church, is the priesthood composed of every believer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF THE PRIESTLY SERVICE BEING<br />
THE BURNING OF INCENSE</h2>
<p>The focus of the priestly service was to burn incense, which signifies our praying to God. The priests needed to regularly take care of many things, such as presenting the offerings, spreading the bread of the Presence, lighting the lamps, and burning incense. All their services focused on burning the incense. The priests needed to present offerings for their burning of the incense at the incense altar. The fire used at the incense altar had to be taken from the bronze altar. This signifies that the prayers we offer in the resurrected Christ must be based on the effectiveness of His redemption on the cross. Only such prayers are accepted by God. The offerings were for the burning of the incense. The priests had to light the lamps before they could burn the incense; otherwise, they would have been in darkness. Therefore, the lighting of the lamps was also for the burning of the incense. The priests also had to eat the bread of the Presence so that they were supplied to burn the incense at the incense altar. The bread of the Presence signifies that the Son of God became our food so that we would live before Him. This shows that the bread of the Presence is also related to burning the incense. Thus, the focus, the center, of the priestly service was burning the incense.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SAINTS NEEDING TO PRAY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the temple of God is composed of priests who pray, that is, burn the incense. Therefore, the temple must be a temple of prayer (Luke 19:46). The built-up church is a house of prayer. This is not doctrine, nor is it an opinion. This is the requirement for the building up of the church. Some saints must rise up in a practical way to carry out the priestly service of entering the Holy Place and burning incense; that is, there must be some who will rise up to pray. Otherwise, it will not be possible to build the church.</p>
<p>In the churches we lack saints who are willing to carry out the priestly service of burning incense before God. The Lord has enlightened us so that we would meet this need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Life through Prayer</h2>
<p>God desires to enter into a group of people and be their life so that they can be mingled and built up in His life. This process requires much prayer. No one can be saved without prayer. Prayer moves those who hear the gospel to receive the Lord. The Bible says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16), and &ldquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). A person is genuinely saved when he calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, because he contacts the Lord. A person who has not prayed may believe only in his mind, not in his spirit. When a person prays, something transpires in his spirit.</p>
<p>In the same principle, until we meet the Lord face to face, our contacting the Lord cannot be separated from prayer. Regardless of how good a message is, without prayer we do not have a way to receive it into our spirit. Hence, immediately after we listen to a message, we must pray concerning any enlightenment that we have received. Then what we have heard will remain in our spirit. When we read the Word, we must also match our reading with prayer. No matter how much we read, we must pray in order to receive the Word into our spirit. Without prayer we cannot receive the spiritual supply, because what we hear or read will remain in our mind. It is only through prayer that what we hear or read can pass through our mind to become the spiritual supply in our spirit.</p>
<p>Prayer is the key for us to contact and enjoy God. Only by means of prayer can we be joined to God. In order for an electric lamp to shine, it needs to be connected to the power station. We need to read the Word, listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. However, the most important matter is that we touch God, that we are joined to Him, in our spirit through prayer. This was our lack in the past. We often had much spiritual activity, but we did not touch God. This is not to say that we do not need to listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. We need these activities, but the most necessary item is that we are joined to God through prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we did not pray enough. The saints and even the full-time serving ones did not pray enough. Hence, the greatest need in the churches is prayer. We must have a change in our concept and see that we need to endeavor to spend time in prayer. God wants us to pay attention to this matter. In order to contact and receive the Lord, we must pray more. Prayer will issue in the practical growth in life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
