   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HOW TO GROW IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I want to fellowship with you about how to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GROWTH IN LIFE BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last message we saw that the genuine building is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the language of the New Testament, to be built is to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christians, however, consider growth as merely a matter of improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But it is possible to have a great deal of improvement without any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The growth in life is the addition of Christ as life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only Christians but even unbelievers may improve as their natural life matures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, as a young person grows from a teen-ager to a man in his late twenties, he will improve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this improvement is not the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians have been helped to improve themselves by listening to sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although sermons may help people to improve, they do not help them to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, to grow is to have more of Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The growth in life is simply the increase of Christ in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the building of the church, the growth in life is urgently needed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have this growth, we cannot have any building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The growth in life is the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This building is not a matter of having someone above you, below you, or beside you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Take the example of Aquila and Priscilla, who were one with the other saints wherever they were.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Aquila and Priscilla could be one with others because they had considerable growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE DEGREE OF ONENESS AND BUILDING DEPENDING ON OUR GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The degree to which we can be one with the saints depends upon the growth in life we have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may be one with certain saints that are close to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if you do not have the proper growth in life, you will not be able to be one with the saints in another locality if you move there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This inability to be one with saints in a new locality proves that you do not have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have the genuine growth in life, you will be one with the saints wherever you may be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we grow in life, the more we are built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have the real growth in life, you will be able to be built together with others whom you have not met before.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you come together with them, there will be no problems because you all have had the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To repeat, the real growth in life is the building, and the genuine building is a spiritual matter in life since the building of God's house is absolutely not material, but spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I must strongly emphasize the fact that the house of God, the church today, is not a physical entity, but a spiritual entity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much we have been built into the church depends upon how much we have grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many have been Christians for years, but do not have any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, there are problems whenever they come together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a family we have brothers and sisters, but no special friends.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, in the church we have only brothers and sisters, not any friends.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, some may still want to have friends among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a sense, they are one with their friends because their friends suit their taste, choice, and preference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if they move to another place that does not match their taste, they will not be one with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if you have the growth in life, wherever you may go you will be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This oneness is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some brothers always want their own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they cannot get it in one place, they will move to another and to still another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have seen saints who moved from one church to another trying to find their preference.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With them there was no growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because there was no growth in life, wherever they went there was no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They simply could not be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But suppose you have the genuine growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even in a church where the situation is the most difficult, you will still be able to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you cannot be one in the place where you are, do not think that by moving elsewhere you will be able to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you should move to another place, you may find it worse than the place you left.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This may cause you to go to even a third place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, the situation will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not move to a certain place in order to have your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, stay in the difficult place, the place where you can have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, it is not a matter of the place, but of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I say again that if you have the growth in life, you will be able to be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By this we see that the genuine building is the growth in life.</S>
