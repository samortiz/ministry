   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST VERSUS RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The central thought of the first chapter of Galatians is the contrast between religion and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we keep this in mind, we will know the proper meaning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The apostle Paul presented himself as an example to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Formerly, he was very involved with the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was trained in Judaism and learned it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only so, he was zealous for it and gave himself entirely to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is man's way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, one day God came in and revealed not a religion, a system, a set of forms, teachings, or practices but a person in him v. 16 . Although Paul was zealous for his forefathers' religion and was one hundred percent for it, God revealed Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then Christ became everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ became life, revelation, and vision within him, and He became the preaching, the work, and the activity outside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, the gospel of the living person of Christ realized and experienced by Paul was not taught to him by man but was a revelation by Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the second chapter, Paul, an experienced believer, told us that he is crucified with Christ; therefore, he has been set free from the law and is dead to the law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has nothing to do with the law, since it is no more he who lives but Christ who lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is no longer obligated to the law or tied to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now he needs only to cooperate with this living person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PROMISED SEED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to understand Galatians 3, we must get into the key thought.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Judaizers thought that the law was the primary item that God gave to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Paul, the writer of this book, proved to them that the primary item given by God is not the law but His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The promise which God gave to Abraham is a seed, which is the very God incarnated to be a man v. 16 . In Him, that is, in this very seed, God will be the blessing and the portion to all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, the seed as the blessing can be possessed, realized, and experienced only by the Spirit v. 14 . We must have the Spirit and be in the Spirit in order to receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is in Christ, Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the witness, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we receive the Spirit, we have Christ and we have God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The key thought in this chapter is that God's intention is to make Himself our portion, our blessing, in Christ by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's intention is not the law; the law was added on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be in Christ, and we must be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must receive the Spirit to enjoy Christ as everything, to be in Christ, to be one with Him, and to be of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we are of the one seed, and this one seed is everything to us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>16, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chapter three reveals that it is not a matter of keeping the law by ourselves, but a matter of being in Christ by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the Spirit we enjoy, experience, realize, and possess Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Galatians 4 tells us that now we are no more little children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, as those who have been brought to the schoolmaster, we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we are not merely children but sons and heirs vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have not only the life of the children but the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sonship mentioned in this chapter is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the custom of the ancient Roman Empire, a son obtained the right of inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the meaning of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before maturity, however, the son was a son only; he did not yet have the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before a person is twenty-one years old, he is the son of his father with the life of a son, but he does not have the right of the son, that is, the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does not have the right to inherit all that his father has until he is fully grown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day the father will declare that he is not only a son but also that he has the sonship with the full right to inherit everything of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostle's thought in this chapter is that from the time that Christ came and accomplished His work, we are no more underage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not according to anything we have done but according to what Christ accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we are no longer underage minors but grown children, God gives us the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we can inherit whatever God is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This inheritance is the fullness of the Godhead, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because we are full-grown ones, sons who are of age, we are entitled to the sonship to inherit whatever Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Formerly, we were children under the hand of a slave, a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As such, we could not enjoy all that the schoolmaster had.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now, however, we have been transferred out of the child-conductor's hand unto the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have come of age and have received the sonship, the right of inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This inheritance is nothing less than Christ Himself with all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we must be filled; that is, the fullness of the Godhead in Christ has to be formed in us v. 19 . Whatever Christ is and whatever Christ has must be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That we are filled in this way proves that we are the sons of God.</S>
