   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO PRESERVE THE LOCAL CHARACTER OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the churches of God are local, we must be careful to preserve their local character, their local sphere, and their local boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a church loses these, it ceases to be a scriptural church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two things call for special attention if the local nature of a church is to be safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first place, no apostle must exercise control in any official capacity over a church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That is contrary to God's order, and destroys its local nature by putting the imprint of an extra-local minister upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No apostle has the authority to establish a private church in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church belongs to the locality, not to the worker.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When people are saved by the instrumentality of any man, they belong to the church in the place where they live, not to the man through whom they were saved, nor to the organization he represents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If one or more churches are founded by a certain apostle, and that apostle exercises authority over them as belonging in a special sense to him or to his society, then those churches become sects, for they do not separate themselves from other Christians saved through the instrumentality of other apostles on the ground of difference of locality, but on the ground of the difference of instrumentality of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus apostles become the heads of different denominations, and their sphere the sphere of their respective denominations, while the churches over which they exercise control become sects, each bearing the particular characteristic of its leader instead of the characteristic of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Epistle to the Corinthians throws light on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was division among the believers in Corinth simply because they failed to realize the local character of the church and sought to make different apostles Paul, Apollos, and Cephas the ground of their fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Had they understood the divinely-ordained basis for the division of the Church, they could never have said, "I belong to Paul," or "I belong to Apollos," or "I belong to Cephas," for, despite their especial love for certain leaders, they would have realized that they belonged not to any one of them, but to the church in the locality in which they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No worker may exercise control over a church or attach to it his name or the name of the society he represents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The divine disapproval will always rest on "the church of Paul," or "the church of Apollos," or "the church of Cephas."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the history of the Church it has frequently happened that when God has given special light or experience to any individual, that individual has stressed the particular truth revealed or experienced, and gathered round him people who appreciated his teaching, with the result that the leader, or the truth he emphasized, has become the ground of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus sects have multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God's people could only see that the object of all ministry is the founding of local churches and not the grouping of Christians around any particular individual, or truth, or experience, or under any particular organization, then the forming of sects would be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We who serve the Lord must be willing to let go our hold upon all those to whom we have ministered, and let all the fruits of our ministry pass into local churches governed entirely by local men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be scrupulously careful not to let the coloring of our personality destroy the local character of the church, and we must always serve the church, never control it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An apostle is servant of all and master of none.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No church belongs to the worker; it belongs to the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Had it been clearly seen by the men who have been used of God throughout the history of the Church that all the churches of God belong to their respective localities, and not to any worker or organization used in their founding, then we should not have so many different denominations today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another thing is essential for the preservation of the local character of the church its sphere must not become wider than the sphere of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The current method of linking up companies of believers in different places who hold the same doctrinal views, and forming them into a church, has no scriptural foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The same applies to the custom of regarding any mission as a center, linking together all those saved or helped by them to constitute a "church" of that mission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such so-called churches are really sects, because they are confined by the bounds of a particular creed, or a particular mission, not by and within the bounds of locality.</S>
