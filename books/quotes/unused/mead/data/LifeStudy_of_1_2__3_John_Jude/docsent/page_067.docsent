   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUBJECTIVE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only through the Triune God becoming the anointing Spirit can we be taught concerning the Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of teaching is not objective; rather, it is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Triune God has become the anointing Spirit and His anointing is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This subjective anointing, the moving of the composition of the Triune God with all His activities, can now teach us the things concerning the Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it is such an anointing that teaches us the things concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Triune God has been compounded not only with the elements of His Person divinity, the Father, the Son, and Spirit but also with the elements of His activities incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these elements have been compounded to become the compound Spirit whose anointing teaches us concerning the things of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BAPTIZED INTO THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The revelation in the Bible concerning the Triune God is very experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, in Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his Word Studies in the New Testament M. R. Vincent says that the name in Matthew 28:19 is equivalent to the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit means to baptize them into the Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as a human name denotes a human person, the divine name denotes the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to put them into the Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Vincent says also, Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The preposition into implies an organic union between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be baptized into the Person of the Triune God means to be placed into an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As those who have been baptized into the Person of the Triune God, we are now organically one with the Triune God, and He is organically one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE TRIUNE GOD TEACHING US CONCERNING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Triune God, who is now organically one with us, is teaching us concerning Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This teaching is subjective and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day, as we are in the organic union with the Triune God, we enjoy Him, we experience Him, and we live in Him, with Him, and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This living is a constant teaching of the things concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can testify that we certainly enjoy the Triune God in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may use eating food as an illustration of learning the things of the Triune God in the way of enjoying and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The best way to know a certain kind of food is to eat that food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you eat the food, you will be taught concerning the food by the very food you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not merely an objective lesson concerning food; it is a subjective knowing of the food through experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more you eat a particular food, the more you will come to know it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This knowledge is not doctrinal; it is experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a similar way, we come to know the Triune God by enjoying and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible for us to know the Triune God merely by doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we can know Him by enjoying and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Triune God becomes our enjoyment and experience, His moving is the anointing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This understanding enables us to give a proper definition of the anointing: the anointing is the moving of the Triune God becoming our inward enjoyment and experience.</S>
