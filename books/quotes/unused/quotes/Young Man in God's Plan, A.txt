Our God, who is full of wisdom, has a plan, and the entire universe was created according to His purpose, His will, His plan
It is absolutely right to say that the Bible is a book full of Christ, yet we can also say that the Bible is a book full of men
Before Stephen was stoned, he said that he saw 'the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God'
If you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that Abraham was seventy-five years old when his father Terah died in Haran
Acts 7:2 tells us that 'the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran'
The first time God called Abraham was while his father was still alive, and the second call came after his father had died
On the other hand, we have to realize that at Abraham's time, a man who was seventy-five years old was still quite young
God calls young people to carry out His move because, generally speaking, young people are not set, settled, or occupied
God would not call those who are set, settled, and occupied because whenever He calls a person that means He has something new to do
With people like Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David there was always a new step of the Lord's going on
It is much easier for God to do something revolutionary with young people, to turn the age from one direction to another direction
Do you not believe that God is waiting for a chance to do something new, to have a change, to have a transfer, to have a turn in the age?
Generally speaking, God does not impart something new through the aged persons, but always through young persons
Zinzendorf was a young man when he was caught by the Lord as was John Nelson Darby, the leader of the Brethren assemblies
It is hard to find a case from the Scriptures or from church history where God called an older person to do something for Him in a new way
It is only when you are young that there is a possibility for God to come in to call you, to choose you, and to use you to do something new
The Holy Spirit is now working and moving in the hearts of the children of God for the carrying out of His move
If you are occupied with the miraculous gifts or with Bible knowledge, God cannot come in to use you for His up-to-date move
If you are settled into a certain form, organization, or ritual, you cannot be used by the Lord to fulfill His purpose
You have to be new, empty, and open, telling the Lord that you are here for nothing on this earth but for Himself
We need to tell the Lord that we are not here for religion, nor are we focused on teachings, doctrines, or gifts
If you would be so fresh, young, and new with the Lord, He would have a way to carry out His new move through you
You may be an older brother in years, and yet still be young in the spirit because you are not set, settled, or occupied
We are not merely fellowshipping concerning salvation or spirituality, but we are dealing with God's eternal purpose
He did not merely threaten the disciples outwardly, but his persecution of the Christians was something from within him
It was as if the Lord were saying to Saul, 'You have to realize that I, Jesus Christ, am one with My disciples
God's revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing
The Jewish religion was the best religion because it was ordained and set up by God Himself But that was not God's eternal plan
All the things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in and enjoying Christ
Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion listed in verses 5 and 6, but all other things as well
Paul says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
He first received the revelation of Christ, and then sought for the experience of Christ to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way
In the whole universe there will be a universal Christ as the Head in the heavens and as the Body on this earth
You could 'kick against the goads' until the end of your life, but when that day comes, you will still say with tears, 'Lord, forgive me'
The only thing you can do is to kick against the goads, but eventually you will recognize that He is the Lord and that you belong to Him
Do you realize that you have to go on to live not according to your first birth but according to your second birth?
The Christian life is not a matter of religion, teachings, doctrines, forms, or regulations, but simply a matter of Christ Himself
Before Saul was met by Christ on the way to Damascus, he was, no doubt, a brilliant, religious, zealous, and strong young man
He was taking the lead to persecute the believers, to devastate the church, yet after he was met by the Lord he became very weak
Before this he would have considered himself marvelously knowledgeable, knowing all things concerning man and God
After three days, the Lord sent a member of the Body of Christ by the name of Ananias to come and lay hands on Saul
As Christians we need to know God's eternal plan in this universe, God's plan for His unique purpose and desire
Something will be impressed into your spirit, and what you understand will be a real strengthening, a real power, a real force within you
He was so zealous for his religion that he persecuted the church of God because the church of God was something different from his religion
In the passage we have just read there are four important items: religion, tradition, Christ, and the revelation of Christ
He was serving Christ according to the tradition of his fathers, not according to the living revelation of the Holy Spirit
Christ as the living One should be realized, experienced, enjoyed, applied, and appreciated by us all the time
On the other hand, it also becomes a barrier, a hindrance, keeping people from the inner experience and enjoyment of Christ
To be zealous for Christianity is really better than being worldly, and to be spiritual is really better than being carnal
You have to realize that even being spiritual could be a barrier between you and Christ and could be a substitute of Christ to you
In the worldly young man we cannot see Christ, and in this religious young man we can neither see anything of Christ
Paul was brought to the realization that the only gain in the universe was Christ Himself To him Christ was the one reality of all
Philippians 3:3 also tells us that Paul did not boast in his religion, in his purity, in his cleanness, or in his religious activity
Many things can creep in, even good things other than Christ, to take the place of Christ in the life of Christians
We must remember that God's plan is to work Christ into us, and we have to pay attention to Christ Himself, nothing else
Paul's desire was 'to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
Paul wanted to be mingled with Christ, to be transformed into Christ in order to become a real member of Christ
The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances
Whenever there is something in your life substituting Christ, you need a conversion from that very thing to Christ Himself
The portion of the saints in Colossians 1:12 is the portion of those who have been sanctified by faith in the Lord in Acts 26:18
Colossians 1:12 refers to the portion of the saints and Acts 26:18 refers to the portion among those who have been sanctified
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in this all-inclusive Person , and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
Because you have seen something of the Lord, you have to do something for the Lord according to what you have seen
As a result of your inward burden for those who do not know Christ, who do not have Christ, it will be easy for you to preach the gospel
Preaching the gospel will not merely be an outward work for you, but something being worked out from within you
Whether or not your word your ministry could open other peoples eyes depends upon how much you have seen and how much you have experienced
Because you are living under the heavenly vision, many times you will work unconsciously, and Christ will be ministered through you
You will have a surplus of Christ, and whenever you come to the meetings of the church you will exhibit Christ
Christ Himself is our knowledge, our teaching, our regulation, our form, our gifts, our power, our weight, and our riches
If you would be faithful to the Lord, the Lord could work out something through you to accomplish His eternal plan
If you take the way of Christ, the living way , something wonderful will be worked out through you for the Lord
You may think that you do not have any gift or ability, but you will be a fruitful person bringing many able and gifted persons to the Lord
You will do this not merely by preaching or teaching but by a living contact with people, imparting Christ into them
It may be that in the entire Scriptures only the Lord Jesus as a man could exceed this man Saul, who was later called Paul
