In order to see the importance of the vital groups, we need a clear view of the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S MOVE ON THE EARTH FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>The Bible is a book written by God Himself, and He is the living and moving God. He has His heart&#8217;s desire and His own purpose, so in eternity past He made an economy to do something for Himself. If we read the sixty-six books of the Bible thoroughly under God&#8217;s enlightenment, we can see clearly that God&#8217;s move on this earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy has only four steps. His move is first, through the Adamic race; second, through the Abrahamic race; third, through the church; and fourth, through the overcomers. My heavy burden is not with the first three steps, but with the last one. All of the following messages will be concerning this last step, the step of God&#8217;s move through the overcomers.<h2 class=head2>A. Through the Adamic Race</h2><p>God&#8217;s move on the earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy was first through the Adamic race.<h2 class=head3>1. With the Tree of Life as the Center and the Goal</h2><p>God&#8217;s move through the Adamic race was with the tree of life as the center and the goal (Gen. 2:9). In every step of God&#8217;s move on this earth, there is a definite center and goal. In the first step, the tree of life is the center and goal. This tree is actually a sign of God Himself as our life.<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Intention</h2><h2 class=head4>a. To Be Taken by Man as Life</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention was to be taken by man as life. He created man and put man in front of the tree of life, indicating that it was good for man to take and eat (Gen. 2:9). Then man could have God as his life.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be One with Man in an Organic Union</h2><p>God wanted to be one with man in an organic union. We may say that we are one with a certain person, but we cannot have an organic union with him. God wanted to be one with man in a particular way, in the way of an organic union.<h2 class=head4>c. To Have a Body in Humanity as the Corporate Expression of the Triune God</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention was to have a Body in humanity to be the corporate expression of the Triune God (Eph. 1:23). From the very first page of the Bible, God revealed Himself as theTriune God, and He needs a Body as a corporate expression to manifest Him.<h2 class=head3>3. Man&#8217;s Failure</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Distracted from God&#8217;s Ordained Line of Life</h2><p>Man&#8217;s failure was that he was distracted from God&#8217;s ordained line of life (Gen. 3:24) to another line, signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There were two trees signifying two sources, two lines, and two centers with two goals.<h2 class=head4>b. Becoming Flesh</h2><p>Because of man&#8217;s failure, he became not merely sinful or worldly but flesh (Gen. 6:3a).<h2 class=head3>4. God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><p>After man&#8217;s failure, God&#8217;s judgment came in.<h2 class=head4>a. Firstly by Water and Then by Fire</h2><p>God judged the fallen race firstly by water, by the flood, at Noah&#8217;s time (Gen. 6:17), and then by fire from heaven to burn Sodom and Gomorrah (19:24-25).<h2 class=head4>b. To Destroy the Fallen Race</h2><p>The final outcome was that God destroyed the fallen race. God could not get through with Adam and his descendants, so He went to another race.<h2 class=head2>B. Through the Abrahamic Race</h2><h2 class=head3>1. With the Good Land as the Center and the Goal</h2><p>With the Abrahamic race, God took the good land as the center and the goal (Gen. 12:7; Exo. 3:8a). From Genesis 12 to the end of Malachi, the center and the goal are the good land. The good land is a complete and full type of the all-inclusive Christ.<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Intention</h2><h2 class=head4>a. To Have a People on the Earth to Be One with Him</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention was to have a people on the earth to be one with Him.<h2 class=head4>b. To Carry Out His Economy That Christ Might Be Brought into Humanity through Incarnation</h2><p>God wanted a people to be one with Him to carry out His economy that Christ might be brought into humanity through incarnation. If there had not been such a land called the good land where God&#8217;s people could have lived, Christ could not have come into humanity through incarnation. For Him to come into humanity, He needed a people, and for these people to live, there was also the need of the land.<h2 class=head4>c. To Take, Possess, and Enjoy the Good Land as a Full Type of Christ</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention with the Abrahamic race was for them to take, possess, and enjoy the good land as a full type of Christ before Christ came to be a man.<h2 class=head3>3. Israel&#8217;s Failure</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Not Entering into God&#8217;s Goal-the Good Land</h2><p>The descendants of Abraham also failed. First, they did not enter into God&#8217;s goal-the good land (Num. 14). The good land was before them, and they could have entered into it, but they would not. This shows that Christ is ready for people to enter into Him, but today very few people would enter into Christ.<h2 class=head4>b. Not Taking and Possessing the Good Land by Destroying the Canaanites</h2><p>Israel also failed by not taking and possessing the good land by destroying the Canaanites (Josh. 13:1-7). Many persons, matters, and things on this earth are frustrating people from taking Christ. This is typified by the seven tribes of the Canaanites occupying the good land to frustrate Israel from taking it. The Israelites should have been bold to trust in God to destroy all those Canaanites, but they failed.<h2 class=head4>c. Not Remaining in the Enjoyment of the Good Land by Walking with God</h2><p>Eventually, the Israelites under Joshua&#8217;s leadership entered the good land, but they did not remain in the enjoyment of the good land by walking with God (Judg. 2:11-15). The historical books of the Old Testament, from Joshua to Esther, give us the details of how to enter into the good land, how to take it, how to possess it, and how to remain in it. The book of Ruth shows us that Naomi&#8217;s husband, Elimelech, swerved out from the good land to Moab. He swerved out of the enjoyment of the good land and was punished by God with death to himself and his two sons. Then Naomi rose up to return. This shows that today many Christians came into Christ and stayed in Christ for a while, but then they swerved from Christ.<h2 class=head3>4. God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Wandering in the Wilderness</h2><p>God judged them firstly by making them wander in the wilderness for forty years. During that time the first generation of those who came out of Egypt died, and they were strewn along in the wilderness (1 Cor. 10:5).<h2 class=head4>b. Oppressed by the Remaining Canaanites</h2><p>Eventually, the children of Israel entered the good land, but they did not dispossess the entire land. They did not utterly destroy the Canaanites, and the remaining Canaanites eventually became a big problem to them. Quite often they were oppressed by these Canaanites.<h2 class=head4>c. Captured and Subdued</h2><p>God also judged them by allowing them to be captured and subdued by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans.<h2 class=head4>d. Scattered to the Nations throughout the World</h2><p>God&#8217;s further judgment on Israel was for them to be scattered to the nations throughout the world.<h2 class=head4>e. Given Up by God</h2><p>Eventually, Israel was given up by God. The Lord told them that they would be given up and that He would turn His kingdom from Israel to the church (Matt. 21:43).<h2 class=head4>f. To Keep Them Away from the Enjoyment of the Good Land</h2><p>Being given up by God, Israel was thus kept away from the enjoyment of the good land. All the historical books of the Old Testament are a record in detail of how we can take Christ, possess Christ, and remain in the enjoyment of Christ as the good land. The New Testament does not show us so many details concerning the enjoyment of Christ as the Old Testament does in type.<h2 class=head2>C. Through the Church</h2><p>God could not get through with the Abrahamic race, so He turned to the church.<h2 class=head3>1. With the Unique Christ as the Center and the Goal</h2><p>The unique Christ is the center and goal of God&#8217;s move through the church (John 3:16; 1 Cor. 1:9).<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Intention</h2><h2 class=head4>a. To Bring Forth the Church as the Body of Christ for the Corporate Expression of the Processed Triune God</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention is to bring forth the church as the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:23; 3:19b).<h2 class=head4>b. For the Consummation of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The church&#8217;s building up is to complete, to consummate, the building of the New Jerusalem. As we are building up the church, we are moving toward a goal, and that goal is the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head3>3. The Church&#8217;s Failure</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Distracted from the Enjoyment of Christ</h2><p>The church failed because it was distracted from the enjoyment of Christ (Gal. 1:6; 4:9). Today&#8217;s Christianity does not even have the term the enjoyment of Christ. Many are fundamental Christians, yet they do not know at all what it is to enjoy Christ.<h2 class=head4>b. Becoming Mixed Christianity</h2><p>The church failed to the extent that it has become mixed Christianity (Matt. 13:33; Col. 2:20-21). The Lord Jesus prophesied in Matthew 13:33 that this would happen. In this verse He spoke of a woman putting leaven into fine flour. The fine flour of the meal offering signifies Christ as food for both God and man, but Christianity has mixed leaven with the fine flour. The leaven includes sin, the world, the flesh, Satan, and all the fallen, negative things.<p>Christianity surely is a mixture. They have the Bible; they have the name of God; they have Christ; and they preach the fundamental gospel that Christ died on the cross for our sins. But there are many unscriptural things, pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters mixed with the teachings of Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity. Today&#8217;s Christianity is an impure mixture. One of the biggest mixtures is the denominations. The standing of all the denominations is condemned and rejected by God (see 1 Cor. 1:12-13 and note 121; Rev. 3:8 and note 83-Recovery Version).<h2 class=head3>4. God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Condemnation on the Fallen Church</h2><p>God&#8217;s judgment is His condemnation on the fallen church. The New Testament is full of God&#8217;s rebuking of the degraded church.<h2 class=head4>b. Cutting the Deformed Church Off from the Enjoyment of Christ</h2><p>God&#8217;s judgment is also His cutting the deformed church off from the enjoyment of Christ (John 15:2a). Today&#8217;s Christianity has not remained in the original form of the church, so it is deformed. Among the seven churches mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3, one was Laodicea. The Lord Jesus was not in that Laodicean church. He was outside knocking at its door (Rev. 3:20). That means the church in degradation is cut off from the enjoyment of Christ.<h2 class=head4>c. To Let the Overcomers Rise Up</h2><p>God&#8217;s judgment on the fallen and deformed church is to let the overcomers rise up. In God&#8217;s move through the Adamic race, through the Abrahamic race, and then through the church there was a failure. God&#8217;s judgment, however, was for the purpose of raising up the overcomers. This is why there is the last book of the Bible-Revelation. In the book of Revelation there is the unique call of the Head, Christ, to His believers for them to be His overcomers. At the close of each of the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Head, Christ, sounded out His call for the overcomers. He repeats this call seven times (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 20-21). The book of Revelation is not a book merely to tell us about the beasts or about the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The book of Revelation is a book concerning the overcomers. We need to pay full attention to the Lord&#8217;s calling for the overcomers.<h2 class=head2>D. Through the Overcomers</h2><p>God&#8217;s move on the earth for the accomplishment of His economy is ultimately through the overcomers. This message is on the vital groups and the overcomers. The vital groups should be composed of people who are overcomers.<h2 class=head3>1. With the Pneumatic Christ as the Center and the Goal</h2><p>God moves through the overcomers to accomplish His economy with the pneumatic Christ as the center and the goal (Rev. 5:6; Phil. 1:19b). The term the pneumatic Christ means that in the last step of God&#8217;s move, Christ was made the all-inclusive Spirit. Revelation 5:6 reveals that the sevenfold-intensified Spirit is the eyes of Christ. A person&#8217;s eyes are one with him, and he is mainly expressed through his eyes. Christ is fully expressed by His seven eyes, and His seven eyes are the sevenfold-intensified Spirit. This makes Christ the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the consummated and compound, all-inclusive Spirit. Philippians 1:19b speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is Christ Himself, and this pneumatic Christ has the bountiful supply. He is all-inclusive; He is rich; He is bountiful in His supply; and this is the very Christ in this age of the overcomers.<p>We need to realize what age we are in. We are not just in the church age. We are in the church, but we are in the age of the overcomers. In order to be an overcomer, we need to know the seven basic items of God&#8217;s recovery. God made Christ the pneumatic Christ as the center and the goal in the recovery of seven things.<h2 class=head4>a. The Participation in the Processed Triune God</h2><p>The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the participation in the processed Triune God. We need to participate in, to partake of, to enjoy, the very Triune God who has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. These are the processes of the Triune God, and today we enjoy Him according to what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 13:14: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; Not just the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but the love, the grace, and the fellowship are with us. He is love, He became grace, and He is grace to us through the fellowship of the Spirit. These are His processes. Today we are enjoying, participating in, and partaking of such a Triune God.<h2 class=head4>b. The Rich Enjoyment of the All-inclusive and All-extensive Christ</h2><p>The second crucial point of the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the rich enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ.<h2 class=head4>c. The Full Experience of the Consummated Compound Spirit</h2><p>Today Christians know the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, but very few know that the Spirit of God today is the consummated compound Spirit.<h2 class=head4>d. The Absolute Living by the Eternal Life</h2><p>The overcomers are also here for the recovery of the absolute living by the eternal life. We Christians possess the human life and the divine life. The problem is the life by which we live. We should live by the divine life, but instead we live by our human life much of the time. When the sisters go shopping, is that by the divine life? Is the way that we comb our hair by the divine life? Do the elders practice their eldership by the human life or by God&#8217;s divine life? If the elders practiced their eldership even fifty percent by the divine life, this would be wonderful. I am always checking in my home, in dealing with my wife, in contacting my grandchildren, and in contacting the saints-is this by the divine life or just by my life?<p>We have to learn to do something higher than ethical conduct, such as not losing our temper by the exercise of our patience. Some old people have learned how to be patient. It is not so easy for them to lose their temper, but this is not by the divine life. Instead, we should exercise our spirit to restrain our temper by the divine life. We should live by the divine life. With the divine life, there is no loss of temper.<p>We may behave ourselves when we are in the meeting, but this may be merely according to our carefulness and not by the divine life. I say this because after the meeting many people become careless in the way that they talk and act. This is why we need the absolute living by the eternal life.<h2 class=head4>e. The Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>We are not here for our education or for doing a job to make a living. We are not even here for the building up of &#8220;our&#8221; church. We are here for the building up of the Body of Christ. Many of the elders are selfish for their own church, but they may not be burdened for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we are building up the church in Anaheim, it should be for the building up of the Body of Christ. The building up of the local churches should be for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head4>f. The Practice of the Churches on the Local Ground</h2><p>The Bible, the New Testament, shows us clearly that every city should have only one church, just like a husband should have only one wife (Rev. 1:11; Acts 8:1; 13:1). But today look at the situation. In all the cities, there is a &#8220;church market.&#8221; In the recent turmoil, the divisive ones did not care for the seriousness of the division which they have made. There should be &#8220;one city, one church; one husband, one wife.&#8221; If we have more than one church in a city, we commit spiritual fornication.<h2 class=head4>g. The Keeping of the Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The final crucial point of the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ. The dissenters in the recent turmoil have abandoned this truth. Even if their accusations were true, this could not be a standing for them to make division. This could not justify their divisive action. Regardless of the situation, a husband should not divorce his wife. Even separation is wrong. We must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Intention</h2><h2 class=head4>a. To Consummate the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>In the age of the overcomers, God&#8217;s intention is to consummate the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12-13). The overcomers of the Lord should pay full attention to the building up of the Body of Christ. Christians are divided today because they do not care for the building up of the Body of Christ; they care only for their own small piece of work. If we are going to build up our local church only, we surely cannot be the overcomers.<p>An overcomer must be one who overcomes the divisions. To be divisive is easy. If two parties do not like each other, it is easy for them to meet in separate places. But to stay together for many years is difficult. To divorce is easy; to separate is easy; but to stay together for a continuous marriage life is not that easy. This is what it means to keep the oneness. You may be very nice to a certain leading brother, but if he would speak to you in a frank way, you might be offended. You would not leave the church life, but you would not speak to this leading brother either. This is a kind of concealed, hidden, division. To keep the oneness, you need to overcome all of the negative things.<h2 class=head4>b. To Usher In the New Jerusalem</h2><p>We are building up the Body of Christ to usher in, to bring in, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 2:7b; 3:12).<h2 class=head3>3. The Overcomers&#8217; Success</h2><p>The overcomers are the successful people in God&#8217;s economy, and we want to see what their success is.<h2 class=head4>a. To Be Vital-Living versus the Deadness of Sardis and Active versus the Lukewarmness of Laodicea</h2><p>A proper Christian should be vital. To be vital means to be living and active. Since I am a man, I must believe into Christ. If I am a Christian, I must be in the recovery. If I am in the recovery, I must be vital. If we are not vital, we may be in the church, but we are not among the overcomers. An overcomer is a vital person.<p>In the seven epistles in Revelation, the Lord condemned the church in Sardis for its deadness. The Lord said that in Sardis nothing was living; everything was dying (3:1-2). It is possible to be attending all the church meetings regularly, yet still be dying, not vital. The church in Laodicea was lukewarm. Those who are lukewarm are not active. They do not take any action. To be vital is to overcome both the deadness of Sardis and the lukewarmness of Laodicea. Maybe the entire church where we are is like Sardis, but this does not mean that we need to leave it. We may say that our church is too dead and that we want to have a living church. But on the entire earth, there is not one church which is completely living. The church may be dying, but we need to stay in the church to overcome the deadness.<h2 class=head5>1) In Saving Sinners That They May Become the Members of Christ</h2><p>We have to be vital in four things. First, we must be vital in saving sinners that they may become the members of Christ. If we do not bear fruit and are barren, we are defeated and are not overcoming. If you are overcoming, you must firstly overcome your barrenness. At least you should bear one or two new ones as fruit yearly.<p>Some told me that they tried going out to knock on doors for three weeks or three months and that they realized it did not work. But we need to try for three years before we say that contacting people for the gospel does not work. We need to go out once a week for two hours, fifty-two times a year, to contact sinners. Sometimes you do not need to go out directly. You can contact people by writing to them or by calling them on the telephone. Do you believe that by doing this continually for fifty-two times a year, you will not gain one person? Surely you will gain someone. Even if you do not gain someone within one year, you will eventually gain someone through your consistent and faithful labor to contact people. Of course, if you do not go out and do not contact people, nothing will happen. The extent of your labor determines the extent of your result.<p>According to Matthew 25, the Lord has given each one of us at least one talent of money for us to deposit with the money changers so that we can make some interest (v. 27). The money changers are the sinners and the young ones whom we perfect to grow in Christ. We have to use our talent from the Lord on them. Then through them we will gain the interest. We have to do business until the Lord comes (Luke 19:13). Whether or not we get persons, we still must be busy to do our business. No doing means no gaining.<p>Matthew 25 tells us that the Lord will come back and ask us to give Him an account (v. 19). We do not want to be the evil and slothful slaves who are rebuked by the Lord. The Lord will cast the evil and slothful slaves into outer darkness for discipline (v. 30), and that age of discipline will last for one thousand years. We should not consider that we are okay and be self-contented. Sooner or later we all will see Him to give Him an account.<h2 class=head5>2) In Feeding the Newborn Believers in Christ</h2><p>Once we contact sinners and make them the members of Christ, they become young babes in Christ. We have to feed these newborn believers in Christ.<h2 class=head5>3) In Perfecting the Saints</h2><p>Our feeding the babes will cause them to grow. Then they will become the saints who need the perfecting.<h2 class=head5>4) In Building Up the Churches for the Building Up of the Body by Prophesying-Speaking for God</h2><p>Eventually, we have to help these perfected saints learn how to prophesy, how to speak for God. Prophesying in the church meetings builds up the churches for the building up of the Body of Christ. If only a few speak in the meetings of the church, the Body of Christ cannot be built up.<p>We must try our best to perfect and to build up all the saints to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. The more speakers there are in the church meetings, the better it is. This kind of speaking edifies the saints locally and builds up the Body of Christ universally. First, we need to exercise ourselves to speak for the Lord. If we will speak for the Lord every week, we will build ourselves up and we will grow. Then we will become living members not only of one local church but also of the universal Body of Christ.<h2 class=head4>b. To Overcome the Degradation of the Church</h2><p>With all the four steps of the God-ordained way mentioned above, we need to pay the price. However, to overcome is not just to overcome all the obstacles and frustrations to carry out the practices of the God-ordained way. We still need to overcome the degradation of today&#8217;s church.<p>Today the Lord has moved through the Adamic race, through the Abrahamic race, and through the church. Eventually they failed the Lord, but He would not give up. In the book of Revelation, He calls for the overcomers to carry out His move on the earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy. The Bible reveals that the overcomers are a success for the Lord.<p>First, in Revelation 12 there are the dead overcomers signified by the man-child born of the universal bright woman. All of those in that corporate man-child overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life unto death (v. 11). Second, there are the living overcomers, the 144,000 raptured to the third heaven to stand with the Lord on Mount Zion (Rev. 14:1). They follow Christ wherever He goes (v. 4). They are the overcomers living up to the time before the tribulation. Besides these two groups of overcomers, there is another group who will overcome Antichrist, his idol, and the idolatrous number of his name (Rev. 15:2). These overcomers all will be martyred, but they will overcome Antichrist. The book of Revelation shows that the Lord has a way to accomplish His economy through His overcomers.<p>Being in the local churches makes it easier for us to be overcomers, but this does not mean that as long as we are in the local churches, we are the overcomers. No church is an overcoming church. But we have to remain in this non-overcoming church to be the overcomers. We should not expect the local church to be an overcoming church. Of course, we all like to see that the church is going on well and improving, but not all the members of a family are the strong ones. Still, in every family there should be a number of strong ones. Not all the citizens of the United States can be soldiers who go to war, but the stronger ones can. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that others in the church are not overcoming. This is wrong. We still have to be overcoming.<p>In Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord rebuked the churches. He even told those in Laodicea that He would spew them out of His mouth (3:16). Still the Lord says to them, &#8220;He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne&#8221; (v. 21). Regardless of the condition of a local church, as long as it is set up on the proper ground of oneness, it is still the church. The ground of the church is the deciding factor as to whether that is a local church or not. If it is, we have to remain there, but we should not remain there in a routine way. We have to be vital.<p>Now we need to consider how we can be vital. First, we must have a time to contact the Lord. Then we will be enlightened by Him to see all our defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, trespasses, and transgressions. We should make a thorough confession to the Lord to have a thorough forgiveness and a thorough clearance of all these negative things before Him.<p>Then you should ask the Lord to give you a companion with whom you can labor in the gospel. You should not say that you do not have the time. Everybody is busy. You have to redeem and budget your time. You should reserve two hours every week for contacting sinners by many ways. Then you can get some saved and baptized to be your spiritual babes. You have to feed them, perfect them, and build them up to prophesy. You must pay the price to take the biblical way, the God-ordained way in the New Testament, not depending on the elders or co-workers but on yourself.<p>Perhaps many in your locality are merely living a routine church life. All of these routine church life people are defeated ones. They are not overcoming. But you have to rise up to pick up the way to be vital. Then you will be a vital person in your local church to produce and build up a vital group. The Lord will then gain some overcomers in your locality, and there will be a way for the Lord to accomplish His eternal economy.<h2 class=head3>4. God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><p>The overcomers will succeed, but the majority of the saints will be defeated. Eventually, God&#8217;s judgment will be applied to all the believers at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10).<h2 class=head4>a. The Reward of the Full Enjoyment of Christ in the Kingdom</h2><p>God will reward the overcomers with the full enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom. Today if you are overcoming, you are enjoying Christ, but not in full. The full enjoyment of Christ will be in the next age. To participate in the full enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom will be a reward to you.<h2 class=head5>1) To Reign with Christ in His Glory</h2><p>The full enjoyment of Christ includes being Christ&#8217;s co-kings in His glory (2 Tim. 2:12a; Rev. 20:4, 6).<h2 class=head5>2) To Partake of the Joy of Christ in His Kingdom</h2><p>The glory of Christ and the joy of Christ are the two main items of God&#8217;s reward to the overcoming saints. The reigning is in His glory and the joy is in His kingdom. Matthew 25:21 and 23 reveal that the overcomers will partake of the joy of Christ in His kingdom.<h2 class=head4>b. The Salvation of the Soul from Losing Christ in the Age of Righteousness</h2><p>Another aspect of the reward for the overcomers is the salvation of the soul. If you have overcome, the Lord will save you from losing Christ in the age of righteousness.<h2 class=head5>1) To Be Saved from Being Cast Out into Darkness in the Age of Discipline</h2><p>The overcomers will be saved from being cast out into outer darkness in the age of discipline (Matt. 25:30). Those who do not overcome in this age will lose Christ in the age of righteousness, the age of the kingdom, the age of discipline.<h2 class=head5>2) To Be Saved from Being Cut Off from the Full Enjoyment of Christ in His Glory</h2><p>Matthew 24:51a says that the defeated ones will be cut asunder. That means they will be cut off from Christ. When we were saved, we were joined to Christ as one. This union with Christ is for our enjoyment of Christ. But if we are defeated in this age, at the coming back of the Lord, He will cut us asunder, cut us off, from the enjoyment of Christ.<p>Even today if we are defeated, we are in darkness and are cut off from the enjoyment of Christ. John 15 says that the branches which do not bear fruit are cut off by the Father (vv. 2a, 6). To cut them off does not mean that they will perish but that they will be cut asunder from the enjoyment of Christ even today. If we are such defeated ones, surely at the Lord&#8217;s coming back, we will be cast out into outer darkness and cut asunder from the very enjoyable Christ in the millennium.<h2 class=head1>II. TO CONSUMMATE THE NEW JERUSALEM FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>God&#8217;s move on the earth through the overcomers is to consummate, to complete, the building of the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s desire. Today we are in the age of the overcomers. In the church life, we must be vital to overcome everything of today&#8217;s degradation among the Christians.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>TO BE VITALIZED</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1a; Rev. 2:4, 12-15, 24, 20; 3:1-2, 15-16, 17-20; 2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22; Rom. 12:1-2, 11; Rev. 14:1-5; 21:1-2</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The cause:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The compassions of God-Rom. 12:1a.</li>	<li>The degradation of the church:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The church in general:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Having left her first love for the Lord-Rev. 2:4.</li>			<li>Having married herself to the world and become satanic, full of the hierarchical teaching-Rev. 2:12-15.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The Catholic Church:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Having become demonic-Rev. 2:24.</li>			<li>Full of fornication and idolatry-Rev. 2:20.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The Protestant churches:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Having been deadened and being dying-Rev. 3:1-2a.</li>			<li>Not complete in anything-Rev. 3:2b.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The Brethren:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Lukewarm, spewed out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth-Rev. 3:15-16.</li>			<li>Self-contented, yet wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked, and Christless-Rev. 3:17-20.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>The calling of the Lord in the age of the overcomers-Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22.</li>	</ol></li><li>The purpose:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To respond to the Lord&#8217;s calling.</li>	<li>For the Lord&#8217;s recovery in this age (pay attention to the seven crucial points of the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery today).</li>	<li>For the building up of the Body of Christ through the proper practice of the local churches:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>On the local ground in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ.</li>		<li>By:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Saving sinners to be the members of Christ.</li>			<li>Feeding the newborn members.</li>			<li>Perfecting the saints.</li>			<li>Prophesying to build up the local churches for the consummation of the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The way:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers.</li>	<li>To make a thorough confession to the Lord.</li>	<li>To have close, intimate, and thorough fellowship with the Lord and with the seeking saints.</li>	<li>To reconsecrate yourself to the Lord:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In presenting your body as a living sacrifice to the Lord-Rom. 12:1.</li>		<li>In being transformed by the renewing of the mind from being fashioned according to this age-Rom. 12:2.</li>		<li>In not being slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit to serve the Lord-Rom. 12:11.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>To be the overcomers in the church life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the age of the overcomers according to the Lord&#8217;s calling.</li>		<li>As today&#8217;s Zion in today&#8217;s Jerusalem (the church life)-Rev. 14:1-5:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of the church, the holy city.</li>			<li>To consummate the holy city (the church) and to bring in the consummated New Jerusalem in eternity-Rev. 21:1-2.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this message we want to see how to be vitalized.<h2 class=head1>I. THE CAUSE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Compassions of God</h2><p>The cause to be vitalized is the compassions of God. This phrase the compassions of God is used in Romans 12:1 by the apostle Paul. He said, &#8220;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God....&#8221; Mercy is not as deep or as tender as compassions, so the word compassions picked up by the apostle is quite significant. It is something deeper in God&#8217;s heart and something deeper that touches our heart.<p>Paul used this word to refer to what he had written in the foregoing eleven chapters of Romans. In those chapters, we are unveiled concerning God&#8217;s choosing. God chose us in eternity past, and based upon this He called us in time. Then He justified us through the redemption of Christ and the forgiveness of sins. We were enemies of God, but He reconciled us to Himself and saved us through the divine life. We were regenerated to be God&#8217;s children and as God&#8217;s children, we enjoy His divine life. In this life we have been saved, we are being saved, and we are to be saved to the extent that we can even reign as kings in this life. What compassions these are! When I consider these items of God&#8217;s compassions I am fully inspired.<h2 class=head2>B. The Degradation of the Church</h2><p>The church includes every member of the Body of Christ. Regretfully, it is a sad situation that most of the children of God, the members of the Body of Christ, have been divided and scattered into all kinds of Christian religions. The church, in general, has become degraded.<h2 class=head3>1. The Church in General</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Having Left Her First Love for the Lord</h2><p>The church, generally speaking, has left her first love for the Lord (Rev. 2:4). The Greek word for first is the same as that translated best in Luke 15:22. Our first love toward the Lord must be our best love for Him. The church, in general, has left her best love for the Lord.<h2 class=head4>b. Having Married Herself to the World and Become Satanic, Full of the Hierarchical Teaching</h2><p>The degraded church has also married herself to the world, and the world is the satanic system of the evil one. Based upon this, the church spontaneously becomes satanic (Rev. 2:12-15). The degraded church is also full of hierarchical teachings. These teachings relate to a religious organization with positions and ranks. Such teachings annul the functions of the members of Christ and do not allow Christ to function as the Head of the Body.<h2 class=head3>2. The Catholic Church</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Having Become Demonic</h2><p>The Catholic Church has become demonic. Revelation 2:24 says that the deep things of Satan are taught in the Catholic Church.<h2 class=head4>b. Full of Fornication and Idolatry</h2><p>The Catholic Church is full of fornication and idolatry (Rev. 2:20), both spiritual and physical.<h2 class=head3>3. The Protestant Churches</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Having Been Deadened and Being Dying</h2><p>In the Protestant churches the striking thing is the deadness. They have been deadened and are still dying (Rev. 3:1-2a).<h2 class=head4>b. Not Complete in Anything</h2><p>Concerning the Protestant churches, the Lord said, &#8220;I have found none of your works completed before My God&#8221; (Rev. 3:2b). The Protestant churches are not complete in anything.<h2 class=head3>4. The Brethren</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Lukewarm, Spewed Out of the Lord&#8217;s Mouth</h2><p>With the Brethren, the striking thing is their lukewarmness. They are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, and because of this the Lord says that He is about to spew them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:15-16).<h2 class=head4>b. Self-contented, yet Wretched, Miserable, Poor, Blind, Naked, and Christless</h2><p>The Lord tells those in Laodicea that they think they are rich, meaning that they are very self-contented. Yet they actually are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked, and Christless (Rev. 3:17-20). This describes the situation of the Brethren today. The Brethren are Christless because the Lord is pictured as being outside the lukewarm church, knocking on the door.<p>The above points show us the degraded situation of today&#8217;s Christianity. Now we need to consider ourselves. Actually, our own situation and condition are not so encouraging either. This kind of degradation should become a cause to make us willing to rise up. It should cause us to pray, &#8220;Lord, I want to be vitalized. I want to rise up.&#8221; The first cause of desiring to be vitalized is the compassions of God, and the second is the degradation of the church.<h2 class=head2>C. The Calling of the Lord in the Age of the Overcomers</h2><p>The third cause to be vitalized is the calling of the Lord in the age of the overcomers. At the end of the first century, the Lord began to sound this calling. This calling for the overcomers is repeated seven times to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 (2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22). Such a calling is still being sounded. When we come to the last book of the Bible, we hear the sounding of the Lord&#8217;s call for the overcomers. If we do not have the boldness to say that we are the overcomers, we should say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be an overcomer!&#8221; We are those in the age of the overcomers.<h2 class=head1>II. THE PURPOSE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Respond to the Lord&#8217;s Calling</h2><p>The first purpose of being vitalized is to respond to the Lord&#8217;s calling. Our desire to be vitalized and be in the vital groups is our response to the Lord&#8217;s calling in this age. The Lord needs the overcomers at this time more than at any other time. The darker the age is, the more the Lord would call His overcomers.<h2 class=head2>B. For the Lord&#8217;s Recovery in This Age</h2><p>We also need to be vitalized for the Lord&#8217;s recovery in this age, paying our full attention to the seven crucial points of the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. These points are the participation in the processed Triune God, the rich enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, the full experience of the consummated, compound Spirit, the absolute living by the eternal life, the building up of the Body of Christ, the practice of the churches on the local ground, and the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ. We have to spend some time to pray over these seven crucial points in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We should pray over them, item by item, until we become fully impressed and even filled up with them.<h2 class=head2>C. For the Building Up of the Body of Christ through the Proper Practice of the Local Churches</h2><p>The purpose of being vitalized is also for the building up of the Body of Christ through the proper practice of the local churches. This item covers two points: the Body and the local expressions of the Body, the local churches.<h2 class=head3>1. On the Local Ground in the Oneness of the Unique Body of Christ</h2><p>The building up of the Body of Christ is on the local ground in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ. Some dissenting ones taught wrongly that the local churches are autonomous. No local church, however, can be autonomous, because the entire church is an organism, an organic Body. No part of our physical body is autonomous. Our nose cannot tell the other parts of our physical body not to touch it or interfere with it. If our nose did this, it would become a dead nose. As long as any member of the body is living, it is altogether not autonomous. Some have overstressed the local churches and neglected the oneness of the Body. We surely stand on the local ground, but we do this in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>2. By:</h2><p>The practice of the local churches is on the local ground in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ by four steps.<h2 class=head4>a. Saving Sinners to Be the Members of Christ</h2><p>We do not care for soul winning. Our preaching of the gospel is not to win souls but to save sinners that they may be the members of Christ. We have to believe that a good number of the thousands of people living around us are ones whom God has chosen in eternity past. We do not know who they are, but the Lord knows. How can we gain these ones?<p>The Bible uses the illustration of fishing. To get sinners saved is like catching fish (Matt. 4:19; Luke 5:9-10). If we do not go to the sea where the fish are, how could we get any fish? The principle, the secret, to gaining a sinner is to &#8220;go fishing.&#8221; There are many sinners, many &#8220;fish,&#8221; around us in the place where we live. If we go to contact them consistently week after week, we will eventually gain someone. We do not like to go fishing, however, because we do not have enough patience. A fisherman will fish patiently until he catches some fish, and we need to be the same in our labor in the gospel. We may go out for almost a year without any result, but at the end of the year we may gain a whole family. We need to labor consistently and look to the Lord that each of us could gain one person yearly as remaining fruit for the church life.<h2 class=head4>b. Feeding the Newborn Members</h2><p>After you save some to be the members of Christ, they are babes. They need the feeding so they can grow.<h2 class=head4>c. Perfecting the Saints</h2><p>The newborn members need the feeding, and the fed ones need the perfecting. So we have to learn how to save sinners, how to feed the new ones, and how to perfect the saints.<h2 class=head4>d. Prophesying to Build Up the Local Churches for the Consummation of the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>Finally, to practice the church life is by prophesying, to speak the word for God and even to speak forth God. This is absolutely different from the practice of Christianity. Their speakers have become a hierarchical group, and that group builds up a kind of rank and system to annul the functions of all the members of the Body of Christ.<p>We may wonder how every Christian could speak for the Lord. Some dear saints who have been in the recovery for a short time may say that they love the church, but that they do not like to prophesy because it is too difficult. But we need to realize that children learn how to speak by listening to and imitating what their parents speak. Today, spiritually speaking, it is the same. As the new ones come to meet with us, they will listen to our speaking and spontaneously learn to speak. The New Testament condemns the clergy-laity system (see Rev. 2:6 and note 61-Recovery Version). The way to build up the Body of Christ is by the prophesying of all the saints. This is why we must learn to speak. We need to prophesy to build up the local churches for the consummation of the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>III. THE WAY</h2><p>Now we want to see the way to be vitalized. Just as there are many ways to drive from Anaheim to Los Angeles, there are a number of ways to be vitalized. Here I am presenting a general way.<h2 class=head2>A. To Be Stirred Up in the First Love for the Lord through Repenting Prayers</h2><p>Although we were unclean and evil sinners, God had compassion on us and chose us. As we consider God&#8217;s compassions to us and meditate on the Lord&#8217;s love in saving us, we will be stirred up in the best love for the Lord through repenting prayers. This will cause us to be vitalized.<h2 class=head2>B. To Make a Thorough Confession to the Lord</h2><p>In our repenting prayers, we need to make a thorough confession of all our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, transgressions, trespasses, etc.<h2 class=head2>C. To Have Close, Intimate, and Thorough Fellowship with the Lord and with the Seeking Saints</h2><p>We need to have close, intimate, and thorough fellowship with the Lord and with the seeking saints. To fellowship only with the Lord is inadequate. We must also be in fellowship with the saints. We need to get companions with whom we can labor. According to the example in the Bible, Daniel had three companions (Dan. 1:6). I would encourage you to get three companions. Do not ask the elders to give them to you. Ask the Lord to lead you to someone, making this one your companion in fellowship. Then you can get a few others. Spontaneously, you and your companions will be a very good small group.<p>The elders should not try to form the groups in an organizational way. That does not work. They must stir up the saints to be vitalized first. Once you get vitalized, you will have the deep sensation that you need companions. Then you need to follow the Lord&#8217;s leading to gain some to join you to be a group. This will be an organic group, and eventually this group will be vitalized. Four saints grouped together is a sufficient number. Do not get more saints at this point. Instead, be vitalized to an extent that you would go fishing to get some new fish. When your organic group of four saints is vitalized, you will not need to hunt for more saints to join you. Instead, you will go fishing to get some new fish.<h2 class=head2>D. To Reconsecrate Yourself to the Lord</h2><p>After you get your companions in fellowship, you must learn to take the lead to reconsecrate yourself to the Lord. You may have consecrated yourself already, but you need to be consecrated afresh.<h2 class=head3>1. In Presenting Your Body as a Living Sacrifice to the Lord</h2><p>To present your body means to give your body to the Lord as a living sacrifice. You have to sacrifice your body to the Lord. This is what Paul taught in Romans 12:1. You need to reconsecrate yourself in presenting your body.<h2 class=head3>2. In Being Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind from Being Fashioned according to This Age</h2><p>Firstly, you give your body to the Lord. Following this you should have your mind renewed from being fashioned according to this age (Rom. 12:2). The world is the satanic system, which is composed of many ages (Eph. 2:2). An age is a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. A number of years ago, men wore wide neckties. That was a current of that age. Later, they wore narrow ties; that was a current of another age. In the sixties, men began to have long hair; that was a current of that age. All the worldly people are fashioned according to the present age. In order to be vitalized, we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind so that we will not be fashioned according to this age.<h2 class=head3>3. In Not Being Slothful in Zeal, but Burning in Spirit to Serve the Lord</h2><p>Our body needs to be presented to the Lord, our mind needs to be renewed, taken over by the Lord, and our spirit needs to be burning. This involves our entire being-body, soul, and spirit. We need to be persons who are fully gained and occupied by the Lord. We should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit to serve the Lord (Rom. 12:11). Then we will be vitalized.<h2 class=head2>E. To Be the Overcomers in the Church Life</h2><h2 class=head3>1. In the Age of the Overcomers according to the Lord&#8217;s Calling</h2><p>The church life is the right place for you to be an overcomer. But this does not mean that as long as you are in the church life, you are an overcomer. It is one thing to be in the church life. It is another thing to be an overcomer in the church life.<h2 class=head3>2. As Today&#8217;s Zion in Today&#8217;s Jerusalem (the Church Life)</h2><p>In the Old Testament, there is the city of Jerusalem with Zion as the center. Jerusalem was built on a mountain range. Mount Zion was one of the mountains on which Jerusalem was built. Zion is the center and Jerusalem is the circumference. The church life is today&#8217;s Jerusalem; within the church life there must be a group of overcomers, and these overcomers are today&#8217;s Zion. According to Revelation 14, the overcomers are standing on Mount Zion with the Lord (vv. 1-5). Actually in typology, the overcomers are today&#8217;s Zion. Then in the last two chapters of Revelation, there is the New Jerusalem. Without Zion (the overcomers), Jerusalem (the church life) cannot be kept and maintained.<h2 class=head4>a. The High Peak, the Center, the Uplifting, the Strengthening, the Enriching, and the Reality of the Church, the Holy City</h2><p>Zion is the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of the church, the holy city. If there are no overcomers in a local church, that church is like Jerusalem without Zion. There are some churches like this today, so they are weak churches. A local church must have some overcomers, and these overcomers are the peak and the center of that local church. They are the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of that local church. If you take away these overcomers from that local church, that local church becomes like a flat tire. The full-time training is for the producing of the overcomers. Once a church has some full-time workers as overcomers, that church is like Jerusalem with the peak of Zion. The overcomers as Zion are the highlight, the center, and the reality of the church.<h2 class=head4>b. To Consummate the Holy City (the Church) and to Bring In the Consummated New Jerusalem in Eternity</h2><p>The overcomers as today&#8217;s Zion are for the consummation of the holy city (the church). They are to consummate, to finish, the building up of the local church and to bring in the consummated New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 21:1-2). In order to complete the building up of the Body, the Lord needs the overcomers, and the building up of the Body consummates in the New Jerusalem. This is why at the end of the Bible, in the last book, there is the calling for the overcomers. Today the way to become vitalized is to answer the Lord&#8217;s call to be an overcomer.<p>There are two ways before us today. We can either choose to be vitalized or choose not to be vitalized. I am presenting these two ways before us. Which way will we take? Are we going to be vitalized or not? We have to make a resolution. In Judges 5:15 Deborah said, &#8220;Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart.&#8221; We have to make a resolution to be the overcomers, the vitalized ones. An overcomer overcomes anything that is replacing Christ or that is against Christ. In the Bible there is the age of the overcomers, and there is the calling for the overcomers. Furthermore, there is a way for us to be vitalized so that we can be the overcomers.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE THREE ENEMIES TODAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rev. 3:1-2; Rom. 12:1-10; Rev. 3:14-18, 20; Rom. 12:11; John 15:2a; Matt. 25:24-30</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The deadness of Sardis-Rev. 3:1-2:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be conquered in the Body life-Rom. 12:3-10.</li>	<li>By:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Presenting our bodies a living sacrifice to God-Rom. 12:1.</li>		<li>Being transformed from the fashion of this age by the renewing of our mind-Rom. 12:2.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The lukewarmness of Laodicea-Rev. 3:14-16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be conquered by the seeking of the riches of Christ-Rev. 3:17-18, 20.</li>	<li>By:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Not being slothful in zeal-Rom. 12:11a.</li>		<li>Being burning in spirit, serving the Lord-Rom. 12:11b.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The barrenness of the degenerating believers:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be conquered in desperation.</li>	<li>By:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Fearing to be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ&#8217;s supply in this age-John 15:2a.</li>		<li>Caring for the discipline in the coming age-Matt. 25:24-30.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We saw in the previous message that the way to be vitalized is to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers, to make a thorough confession to the Lord, to have close, intimate, and thorough fellowship with the Lord and with the seeking saints, and to reconsecrate yourself to the Lord. In this message we want to see three particular enemies which we have today. These enemies are deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness. This is why we feel desperate that we need to look to the Lord for Him to vitalize us. We need to be made living, burning, and fruitful.<p>These three enemies are mainly toward the good Christians, toward the brothers and sisters who are regularly attending the meetings. They are not enemies to the worldly Christians, to those who live in their pleasures and entertainment. We may love the Lord and attend the meetings faithfully and regularly. But we have to realize that deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness are our habitual enemies. We may not even consider them as practical and even fatal enemies.<p>Death is more defiling before God than sin (Rev. 3:1; Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:7, 9). Furthermore, lukewarmness is an abominable thing in the eyes of the Lord. The lukewarmness of Laodicea caused the Lord to spew the Laodiceans out of His mouth (Rev. 3:16). Do we appreciate being spewed out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth? This shows us how serious it is to be lukewarm. We may be good Christians and good saints in the recovery who attend the meetings and serve the church regularly, but we are not so living or burning. We are neither hot nor cold. Instead, we are lukewarm.<p>Barrenness is an even more subtle enemy. Some married couples are not able to have children, and this becomes a big problem to them. According to human desire, the meaning of a couple&#8217;s life is to have children. Likewise, if we do not bear fruit, beget some spiritual children, there is not much meaning to our church life. Without fruit-bearing, there is no practical church life. Suppose that we baptized fifty-eight new ones in the next Lord&#8217;s Day church meeting. All of us would be excited and joyful in the Lord. But we do not have much joy, because we are barren. Barrenness is the biggest enemy that annuls the proper church life.<p>If we cannot have children in our human life, we can have the Lord as our replacement. But the Lord will not be the replacement for the fruit which we do not bear in the church life. We may feel that we have been enjoying the Lord every day, but a tree is known according to its fruit. The real church life can be evidenced only by fruit-bearing. If we have not borne fruit for three years, for five years, or even for ten years, our enjoyment of Christ should be questioned. Something must be improper or wrong if we are not bearing fruit.<p>In the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord touched the deadness with Sardis and the lukewarmness with the Laodiceans, but He did not touch barrenness. This is because He had already dealt with this very seriously in John 15. In the four Gospels, the Lord did not deal with deadness or with lukewarmness. But He dealt with barrenness to the uttermost in one chapter-John 15. Some people would say that this is a chapter on abiding in Christ. Actually, however, it is not on abiding but on fruit-bearing. Abiding is for fruit-bearing. The Lord said, &#8220;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away....If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up&#8221; (vv. 2a, 6a). For a branch to be cast out means that it is cut off from participation in the riches of the life of the vine.<p>If we do not bear fruit, there is a danger that we will be cut off from the vine tree. This does not mean that we will suffer eternal perdition but that we will lose our enjoyment of Christ as our portion. This proves that if we do not bear fruit, there is a problem with our enjoyment of Christ. This is just like a couple who cannot bring forth children. They may say that they do not feel anything is wrong with them, but actually something is wrong that is preventing them from having children. They may even go to some doctors to find out what is wrong with them. This is an illustration of our problem of barrenness. We may feel there is nothing wrong with us, but based upon the fact that we have not borne fruit, we must realize that something is wrong with our enjoyment of Christ. If we do not have fruit, our so-called enjoyment of Christ can be a self-deceiving matter. It is not so real.<p>We may think that we have seen a number of saints who have not borne fruit for quite a long time, but we did not notice that they were cut off from the enjoyment of the Lord. My answer to this is that the matter of life is a mystery. There may be a couple who cannot bear children, but no one can see the reason. In the same way it may seem that we are doing quite well, but where is our fruit? This is a test. If we are not bearing fruit, this is evidence that we have lost our enjoyment of Christ. In this message I want us to realize that every day, day and night, these three enemies are around us: deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.<p>In the previous message, I shared that we need to get some companions, at least two or three, with whom we can labor in the gospel. We should never work by ourselves. Instead, we should work by fellowshipping with our companions. The trouble is that we do not like to have fellowship with others. We are self-contented, and some of us may think that we are omnipotent and all-capable. But according to my over sixty years of experience, none of us is omnipotent. Each of us is very limited in his capacity and ability. You need the help, and I need the help. My helpers in the work know how much I need them. I purposely fellowship with them and ask them questions that I may learn. I want to be taught by them. If there is no fellowship among us in our work, there cannot be the real one accord. We need to labor in oneness through thorough fellowship. Because of our unwillingness to have thorough fellowship, we are dead, lukewarm, and barren. We must get some companions and open up ourselves to fellowship with them to the uttermost.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DEADNESS OF SARDIS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Be Conquered in the Body Life</h2><p>The first enemy is the deadness of Sardis (Rev. 3:1-2). This enemy is conquered in the Body life (Rom. 12:3-10). If you are not living in the Body, you are through. You cannot conquer deadness. Today&#8217;s Christians are dead because they do not live in the Body.<h2 class=head2>B. By:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Presenting Our Bodies as a Living Sacrifice to God</h2><p>Romans 12:1 says that we need to present our bodies as a living sacrifice to God. Our body includes our entire person. Our spirit and our soul are within our body, so if our body is presented to the Lord, our entire being is presented to Him. We may say that we have already offered ourselves to the Lord, but we need to repeat our consecration every day and even many times throughout the day. This may be likened to eating. We cannot say that we do not need to eat today because we have eaten yesterday. We have to eat three meals a day every day in order to stay healthy. Consecration also is not a once for all matter. It should be something continuous, without ceasing. Every day and every moment in everything, we need to stand on the ground of consecration.<h2 class=head3>2. Being Transformed from the Fashion of This Age by the Renewing of Our Mind</h2><p>We also need to be transformed from the fashion of this age by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2). To offer our bodies to the Lord is to deal with ourselves. To be transformed by the renewing of the mind is to deal with this age, the practical world in front of us. We need to deal with ourselves, and we need to deal with our relationship with and concept concerning the practical world, which is today&#8217;s age. We are deadened because we do not present ourselves to the Lord and because we secretly follow this age. To present our body is to give ourselves to the Lord without any reservation. We should not keep any part of ourselves for ourselves. We must give ourselves to the Lord absolutely. Also, we should not secretly follow this age.<p>The age in front of us is very subtle. I have seen some of the saints unconsciously become deceived by the age to follow it. We cannot conquer deadness if we follow this age even partially. The age is not hidden, but our following of it is hidden. We may still have a pretense that we love the Lord to the uttermost, but actually there is an undercurrent within us to follow the age, to love the world. If we are being secretly fashioned according to this age, how can we be living in the Lord? In the United States today there are two very negative things: sin and the age. These two things are deadening the Christians in this country. Our mind needs to be renewed so that we will not be fashioned according to this age.<h2 class=head1>II. THE LUKEWARMNESS OF LAODICEA</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Be Conquered by the Seeking of the Riches of Christ</h2><p>We also need to conquer the lukewarmness of Laodicea (Rev. 3:14-16). We can do this by seeking the riches of Christ (Rev. 3:17-18, 20). We may be enjoying Christ to a certain extent, but we need to enjoy Him in a deeper, higher, broader, and richer way. We should tell the Lord that we want to have new experiences of Him. Some among us may be enjoying Christ in the same way that they did ten years ago. This means that they have become lukewarm and are self-contented.<h2 class=head2>B. By:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Not Being Slothful in Zeal</h2><p>Romans 12:11a says that we should not be slothful in zeal.<h2 class=head3>2. Being Burning in Spirit, Serving the Lord</h2><p>Romans 12:11b says that we need to be burning in spirit, serving the Lord. We must seek the riches of Christ continuously. We should not be slothful, but we should be burning in our spirit. Then the lukewarmness will be swallowed up by the burning in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>III. THE BARRENNESS OF THE DEGENERATING BELIEVERS</h2><p>Finally, we need to overcome the barrenness of the degenerating believers. Today, many believers have become old and degenerating.<h2 class=head2>A. To Be Conquered in Desperation</h2><p>This barrenness can be conquered only in desperation. Real desperation is an attitude that something is a matter of life or death.<h2 class=head2>B. By:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Fearing to Be Cut Off from the Enjoyment of Christ&#8217;s Supply in This Age</h2><p>We should fear to be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ&#8217;s supply in this age (John 15:2a). If we are barren, we should not believe that we are continuously enjoying Christ. We may feel that we are, but actually we are not. Our enjoyment of Christ has become stale. We are enjoying Him in the same way that we were years ago with no improvement. The Lord said that if a branch does not bear fruit, the Father will cut it off. We should have some fear regarding this.<h2 class=head3>2. Caring for the Discipline in the Coming Age</h2><p>Matthew 25:24-30 tells clearly how the lazy, evil servant will be disciplined by the Lord in the coming age by being cast into outer darkness. We may know this portion of the Word, and yet not really have much regard for the discipline in the coming age. John 3:16 is the word of the Lord. Matthew 25:24-30 is also the word of the Lord. If John 3:16 is trustworthy, Matthew 25:24-30 should also be trustworthy. We have to bear fruit. Otherwise, we are running the risk of being cut off from the enjoyment of Christ. Also, Matthew 25 tells us that if we do not make a profit with the Lord&#8217;s talent, we will be disciplined in the coming age. This is a very serious matter.<p>We all have to hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness. We must seek to be vitalized in desperation, considering this to be a matter of life or death. The practice of the vital groups will not work if we take it lightly. We must fellowship about the matter of barrenness with our companions. Then the Lord may lead us to make a decision to fast once a week. When Brother Watchman Nee was a student, he decided to fast and pray every Saturday for the next day&#8217;s preaching of the gospel. We may also feel led by the Lord to fast and pray for our fruit-bearing.<p>We must carry out the practice of the vital groups in desperation. We should pray desperately for the Lord to give us some fruit and remove our barrenness. This should be a matter of life or death with us. If we are desperate, I believe that the fish will come to us. The Lord will send them to us. But if we are indifferent, no fish will come to us. The hardest thing is for us to be made desperate. The most crucial thing for us today is to be desperate to conquer the deadness of Sardis, the lukewarmness of Laodicea, and the barrenness dealt with by the Lord in John 15.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>HOW TO START YOUR VITAL GROUP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:16-27; Rom. 1:14-15</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>By fellowshipping with your companion through desperate prayers for the Lord&#8217;s blessing.</li><li>To start from the first step of the God-ordained way-to get sinners saved to make them the members of the Body of Christ.</li><li>To review all of your acquaintances-relatives, neighbors, friends, schoolmates, and colleagues-and make a list of them.</li><li>To pray over the name list and seek the Lord&#8217;s leading concerning who should be the first for you to take care of.</li><li>To also keep yourself open to the Lord for His leading to visit people other than your acquaintances.</li><li>The way to visit, contact, and gain the gospel candidates:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To visit them by appointment continuously.</li>	<li>To invite them to your dinner regularly.</li>	<li>To write them concerning their salvation periodically.</li>	<li>To mail them gospel tracts and spiritual booklets all the time.</li>	<li>To pray concerning the spiritual welfare of certain definite ones for your whole life.</li>	<li>Whatever way you take, you should do it persistently with patience and endurance and do not expect to have a quick reaping.</li>	<li>Learn how to use biblical verses and tracts.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this series of messages, I am not burdened to speak doctrinally. I have already released many messages concerning the God-ordained way with the vital groups, so I am now burdened to speak something that will help us be brought into the actual practice of the vital groups. We may have the terms God-ordained way and vital groups, but do we really walk in the way ordained by God? Are we really vital? We do not want mere terminology but the actual experience of being vital persons in the God-ordained way.<p>In these days I feel that we are short of prayer. When we come together, we should have the burden to pray much. If we had the spirit of prayer and the burden of prayer, nothing would be able to stop us. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, we hate these three enemies. We hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.&#8221; We may be in the recovery, but we are dead, lukewarm, and barren. I would like to hear us pray, &#8220;Lord, give me the burden to bear fruit. Give me the utterance and the boldness in speaking for You.&#8221; We need this kind of desperate prayer.<h2 class=head1>I. BY FELLOWSHIPPING WITH YOUR COMPANION THROUGH DESPERATE PRAYERS FOR THE LORD&#8217;S BLESSING</h2><p>In this message we want to fellowship about how to start your vital group. First, you have to fellowship with your companion through desperate prayers for the Lord&#8217;s blessing. We have shared previously that we need to look to the Lord for some companions. If you do not have a companion, pray desperately from tomorrow to get one. Without a companion, there is no way for you to start the vital group. Then you need to fellowship with your companion through desperate prayers. You should not just talk to one another. Talk means nothing. It is vanity. When you come together, it is better to turn your talk into prayer. If you talk, talk to the Lord.<p>Furthermore, we should not pray in a routine way. We should pray desperately, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m so barren; I&#8217;m not happy about this, Lord; help me get out of this.&#8221; This is genuine prayer. I do not want to pray routine prayers. If I pray, I must pray something out of my burden. In order to pray routine prayers, we do not need to exercise our spirit or to shed tears. But when we pray desperately from our spirit to discharge our prayer burden, we will weep. We must have this kind of genuine and vital prayer.<p>If the Lord has mercy upon us and we would receive His mercy, our vital group will do well, and after six to nine months, we should split our group to have a new start. This should take place again and again. We must take a way of doing things in every step by having the full assurance that the Lord is satisfied and that we also are satisfied.<p>We need to have desperate prayers for the Lord&#8217;s blessing. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, we are nothing, so we have nothing. But You are the all-inclusive Lord, and You are the unsearchably rich One. We need Your blessing. Without Your blessing, we are dead. Without Your blessing, we are cold, not even lukewarm. Without Your blessing, we are just fruitless. We need Your blessing.&#8221; We must pray in a desperate way, &#8220;Lord, grant us the remaining fruit that we need. We have been barren for many years.&#8221; Such a prayer of desperation causes us to have a thorough repentance.<p>Dear saints, to be a Christian should mean something. Our being a Christian is not just for escaping from hell and going to heaven. This is too low. The Bible shows us something much, much higher than this. It shows us that God has an eternal economy, His eternal plan. We are here meaning business with the Lord to be one with Him for the carrying out of His economy. This is why we need to fellowship with our companion through desperate prayers for the Lord&#8217;s blessing.<h2 class=head1>II. TO START FROM THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY-TO GET SINNERS SAVED TO MAKE THEM THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>We have heard the steps of begetting, feeding, teaching, and building up. In order to start our vital group, we need to start from the first step of the God-ordained way-to get sinners saved to make them the members of the Body of Christ. We are going to get sinners saved to make them the living, functioning members of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is practical, present, and for today. God&#8217;s eternal economy is to get a Body for Christ, but hardly anyone on this earth is caring for this.<p>The Lord charged us to go to disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19). We should not excuse ourselves by saying that the nations are too evil and that the current and tide of today&#8217;s world are too strong. When we go to the Lord to give Him an account, He will not take any excuses. The Lord needs us today because of the negative situation. He needs us to go and get sinners saved to make them the members of the Body of Christ. We need to be desperate to bear new ones as remaining fruit each year. It is absolutely abnormal to be in the church life year after year without bearing fruit.<h2 class=head1>III. TO REVIEW ALL OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCES-RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS, SCHOOLMATES, AND COLLEAGUES-AND MAKE A LIST OF THEM</h2><p>We also need to review all of our acquaintances and make a list of them. Our acquaintances include our relatives, neighbors, friends, schoolmates, and colleagues.<h2 class=head1>IV. TO PRAY OVER THE NAME LIST AND SEEK THE LORD&#8217;S LEADING CONCERNING WHO SHOULD BE THE FIRST FOR YOU TO TAKE CARE OF</h2><p>Then you need to pray over the name list and seek the Lord&#8217;s leading concerning who should be the first for you to take care of. If you would pray in this way, the Lord will lead you and you will have the burden to contact specific people. You need to take every step of the God-ordained way by prayer. You should not do anything without adequate prayer.<h2 class=head1>V. TO ALSO KEEP YOURSELF OPEN TO THE LORD FOR HIS LEADING TO VISIT PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOUR ACQUAINTANCES</h2><p>You should not limit yourself to your acquaintances. The Lord said to go to disciple the nations, to disciple everyone. So you should keep yourself open to the Lord for His new leading to visit new people other than your acquaintances.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE WAY TO VISIT, TO CONTACT, AND TO GAIN THE GOSPEL CANDIDATES</h2><p>Actually, there are many ways to visit, to contact, and to gain the gospel candidates. Here I would like to mention some of them.<h2 class=head2>A. To Visit Them by Appointment Continuously</h2><p>You do not need to go out to knock on cold doors. You can visit people by making appointments with them. You must do this not only continually but also continuously, day by day.<h2 class=head2>B. To Invite Them to Your Dinner Regularly</h2><p>We also need to have a practice and a habit of inviting people to have dinner with us. We should do this regularly. Brother Eugene Gruhler, Sr. was an example among us of a brother who was always taking care of people in this way. Nearly every Lord&#8217;s Day, this brother&#8217;s home was prepared to receive people for lunch after the morning meeting. He would oversee the meeting and invite certain ones to come to his home afterward to eat with him.<p>I fellowshipped with the elders recently that they must learn one thing: to contact people. The best way to contact people is to invite them to your home for dinner. This is the most effective way to get people. Something can be impressed into people in this way. After many years they may still receive the help and even be saved by your one contact with them in your home.<p>I would like us to consider what we are here for. The world means nothing to us. We are here purely for the Lord and His desire to disciple others, to save them, that they may become the members of the Body of Christ which we are now building. According to our present situation, we do not have the new material for the building up of His Body. We may go on year after year in the church life without many people being baptized. The new ones whom we do baptize may disappear from our midst after a while. They did not survive due to the shortage of proper and adequate care. If a mother delivers a child and does not take care of it, it will not survive. We need to follow the example of the apostle Paul, who said that he cared for the new believers &#8220;as a nursing mother would cherish her own children&#8221; (1 Thes. 2:7).<h2 class=head2>C. To Write Them concerning Their Salvation Periodically</h2><p>We also need to write our gospel candidates periodically concerning their salvation. We may write a particular person once every two weeks. Thus, within a whole year we can write this one twenty-six times.<h2 class=head2>D. To Mail Them Gospel Tracts and Spiritual Booklets All the Time</h2><p>When we write people we should also mail them gospel tracts and spiritual booklets.<h2 class=head2>E. To Pray concerning the Spiritual Welfare of Certain Definite Ones for Your Whole Life</h2><p>We should not pray for too many people. Instead, we should pray concerning the spiritual welfare of certain definite ones for our whole life. George Muller had a list of people for whom he prayed on a regular basis. Eventually, all of them except one were saved before his death. After his death this one also was saved by the Lord.<p>According to history and according to the Bible, if there is no prayer for anyone, no one can be saved. You and I were saved because somebody prayed for us. No doubt, God has chosen millions of people. But there is the need of human prayer to cooperate with the divine choosing. If you do not pray, God has no way to visit a particular chosen one. There is the need of prayer to match His choosing. If you just pray occasionally, that will not work. You must be burdened to pray for certain ones and continue that prayer for your whole life.<p>Everyone who prays knows that to pray is to climb a high mountain. The enemy, Satan, will send many things to frustrate our prayer. He does not want anyone to pray. Because of this warfare, we must pray with much persistence (Col. 4:2). Prayer is a struggle. Whenever we start to pray in our homes, the phone may ring or someone may knock on the door. It is best not to answer the phone or the door during our prayer time. We should consider ourselves to be away because we are occupied with our Lord in the third heaven. If we do not pray, no one may call or knock at the door. But as soon as we begin to pray, someone calls or comes to contact us. Is this coincidental? Actually, the phone call or the knock at the door was instigated and sent by the devil to interrupt and stop our prayer.<h2 class=head2>F. Whatever Way You Take, You Should Do It Persistently with Patience and Endurance and Do Not Expect to Have a Quick Reaping</h2><p>Whatever way you take, you should do it persistently with patience and endurance and do not expect to have a quick reaping. All the farmers know that they cannot have a quick reaping. A quick reaping means a poor reaping. The farmers have to be patient to care for their crop until the time for harvest comes. After a period of time, you will gain some new ones as remaining fruit. This will be a recompense to your persistent labor in the gospel.<h2 class=head2>G. Learn How to Use Biblical Verses and Tracts</h2><p>We also need to learn how to use biblical verses and tracts. We have recently published some tracts entitled Our Faith, Our Gospel, Our Commission, and Our Meetings. We will do our best to put out more of these tracts for our use in the gospel. When we go to contact people, they may wonder who we are and what we believe in. We can give them the tract entitled Our Faith as a gift. This tract is concerning our belief in the Bible, God, Christ, the Spirit, and God&#8217;s redemption and salvation. We can read a paragraph with them, perhaps the paragraph concerning our belief in the Bible. After reading this paragraph, they will become clear that we are Christians who believe in the Word of God. This will help to open up the situation with the ones whom we contact. We should study the main points in these tracts with the appropriate biblical verses so that we can be equipped to gain our gospel candidates.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF YOUR VITAL GROUP TODAY?</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 25:4; 2 Tim. 1:6</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Have you started your vital group?</li><li>Have you rekindled your new man?</li><li>Have you refilled your lamp?-Matt. 25:4.</li><li>Have you fanned your flame?-2 Tim. 1:6.</li><li>Have you started to have the intimate and thorough fellowship with your companion?

Now we are burdened to get into the practice of it. In this message we want to consider the condition of our vital group today by responding to eight questions.<h2 class=head1>I. HAVE YOU STARTED YOUR VITAL GROUP?</h2><p>The first question we need to answer is: &#8220;Have you started your vital group?&#8221; I trust that we have done something to start our vital group.<p>We need to practice the items of the God-ordained way so that we can do them in a consistent way with longevity. If we want to do anything with longevity, we should not practice it in an extreme way. Since we want to spend a time with the Lord every morning, we should always rise up at a certain proper time. If we rise up too early, we will eventually not be able to keep it up. I do not want to see anyone doing anything in an overly excited way. I have been serving the Lord as a slave and taking care of the saints for many years, and I have found out that excitement means nothing. Everyone who is overly excited dies quickly. If we can pray for fifteen minutes every morning, we should simply do that much. If we try to rise earlier or do anything more than this, it will not last long.<p>We pointed out that we need to go to the Lord individually to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers. We need to make a thorough confession to the Lord. In our time with the Lord, we may say with tears, &#8220;Lord, I repent. I&#8217;m so sinful and dirty.&#8221; I have been practicing this for close to seventy years. We all have to learn the lesson in our prayer not to teach the Lord. Mostly we should not ask the Lord to do something for us. Instead, we should cry out desperately from the depths of our being, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m sinful! I need You, Lord.&#8221; The Bible even says that some beat their breast when they made their confession to the Lord (Luke 18:13).<p>If you are so sincere, honest, and faithful to the Lord, when someone asks you about your repentance, you might immediately begin to shed some tears. You would still be in the sensation of how sinful you are. Every sinner who gets saved should repent. There are many degrees of people&#8217;s repentance: Some repent shallowly and superficially. Others repent more deeply. Still others repent to the uttermost in a desperate and thorough way from the depths of their being. They may even beat their breast or roll on the floor while they are repenting and confessing to the Lord.<p>In the preaching of the gospel, we need to get people convicted and subdued. The ones who get saved should have the sensation and realization that they are sinful and need the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness. When an unbeliever prays with sincerity, &#8220;Oh, Lord, I am sinful,&#8221; this means he is being touched by the Lord. The way to be vitalized is to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers.<p>I have a burden to help the saints become vital. Now we need to be brought into the genuine practice of the vital groups. In order to be vitalized, we need to be like the athletes who are in the Olympics. If we want to know what desperation is, we should consider these athletes. Their dedication and endeavoring are a good display of desperation. The Christian life is a life of martyrdom. Paul knew that he was going to be martyred (2 Tim. 4:6). The Lord Jesus told us that anyone who would come after Him must deny himself and take up his cross to lose his soul-life (Matt. 16:24-25). This is much different from the &#8220;sugar-coated gospel&#8221; preached in today&#8217;s Christianity. From my Christian experience I can say that the only real enjoyment for a Christian is not physical. It is absolutely spiritual. Physically speaking, every step, every aspect, of the Christian life is a sacrifice.<p>When the Lord sent me to this country, I passed on many messages on the deeper truths, telling people how to enjoy Christ. At the beginning they were happy. Gradually and eventually, however, they lost their enjoyment mainly because they would not pay the high price. The Lord told the Laodiceans that they were lukewarm and that He was about to spew them out of His mouth. Then He told them that they had to pay the price to buy the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve (Rev. 3:15-18). Buying requires the paying of a price. In today&#8217;s Christianity where can you hear a message saying that you have to buy? Dear saints, if we are going to be vitalized, we do have to pay a price.<p>If you would analyze your start of the vital group, I believe you would be convinced that you have not started yet. You may have never had a genuine repentance. A genuine repentance means that you are under a kind of constant condemnation to such an extent that you realize you are nothing but a constitution of sin, transgressions, trespasses, mistakes, wrongdoings, and offenses. When you make a thorough confession, you will realize that you are a constitution of the flesh, the old man, the natural man, the world, and Satan. You will find out that the more you confess, the more you have to confess. It will seem that the dirt can never be cleared away. A thorough confession may take two weeks.<p>If you do not have such a repentance and confession with tears, how can your companion be led into being vitalized? We must have a genuine start of the vital groups. Dear saints, have you ever made a thorough confession before God? Just to go to the Lord for five minutes to tell Him, &#8220;Lord, I am sinful; I repent,&#8221; might be a kind of repentance, but that is not a thorough repentance.<p>Psalm 51 is a psalm of David&#8217;s repentance and confession of his indulging sin. He was rebuked by Nathan the prophet for what he had done, and he made his confession. By reading that psalm you can see that his repentance and confession actually have no end. You should not believe that Psalm 51 has finished, or completed, David&#8217;s repentance and confession. The real confession, the real repentance, according to my experience, has no ending. We are a heap of sin. Our constitution is sin. How then could we finish our confession?<p>We may confess our sins and then be mean to someone right after our confession. How could we be holy? How could we be righteous? But when we repent and confess-the more thoroughly the better-we receive mercy and grace. We should not think that we can finish our confession. The whole Christian life, on the negative side, is a life of confession. Every day and every moment we have to confess. Whenever we open up our mouth to pray, we should not say a word before confessing. After our confession, we are still sinful. Because we are living in a dirty world, medical doctors tell us that we should wash our hands frequently to avoid getting sick. In the same way, we need to confess frequently day by day. We need to have such a thorough repentance and confession.<h2 class=head1>II. HAVE YOU REKINDLED YOUR NEW MAN?</h2><p>We believers have been regenerated and made by God to be a new creation. We have a new man in our being which needs to be rekindled. But most of the time we put this new man aside. We may come to the meetings, and yet leave our new man at home. Doctrinally speaking, this can never happen, but practically speaking, it can. This is why we have to always rekindle our new man.<p>There is no need for us to rekindle our old man because this ugly thing is everlasting. The old man will be with us until it is thrown into the lake of fire to be burned. When I was young, people would ask me why God would burn sinners in the lake of fire for eternity. We need to see that the old man came out of the evil Satan who is everlasting, so he needs a kind of everlasting fire. There is no need for us to rekindle our old man because the evil one is always rekindling it. But we do need to rekindle our new man, and the only way to do this is by constant and continuous prayer. This is why the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Once we cease our prayer, right away our new man needs rekindling. To have our new man rekindled is not a common thing. Very few Christians know how to rekindle their new man.<h2 class=head1>III. HAVE YOU REFILLED YOUR LAMP?</h2><p>Have you refilled your lamp? This question is based upon Matthew 25. The five wise virgins had oil in their vessels and in their lamps (v. 4). But the problem with the foolish virgins was that they neglected the refilling of the oil in their lamps (v. 3). We can refill our lamps by spending time with the Lord. This is not just by prayer. First, we have to pray that our new man will be rekindled. Then we have to stay with the Lord to have the refilling of the oil in our lamps.<p>If we go for an entire day without praying, we feel that there is no burning within us and no light. There is no rekindling. But if we pray, after five minutes we realize that something has been rekindled within us, and that is the new man. A few minutes of prayer may rekindle our new man, but that cannot refill our lamp. To refill our lamp we have to stay with the Lord. According to my experience, we need at least half an hour for this. One hour is the proper time to be with the Lord in this way.<p>This is not just to pray, but to be with the Lord; not just to read the Bible, but to be with the Lord; not just to meditate, to muse on some golden verses, but to be with the Lord. To be with the Lord is even better than musing on some golden verses. It is better than meditating on some portion of the Bible. To be with the Lord is better than studying the Bible. It is even better than praying. Without reading, without praying, and without meditating, you can enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence by being with Him. Then you get the refilling. Put this into your experience. To rekindle your new man is by prayer. To refill your lamp is by spending time with the Lord.<h2 class=head1>IV. HAVE YOU FANNED YOUR FLAME?</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 1:6 Paul told Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God which was in him. We may have a flame, but the flame is dying. We have to fan the flame within us into a fire until we become burning. Today there is just a little flame within us, so we can sleep well. But when the flame becomes a fire in the house, we cannot sleep. We will be burning in spirit for the Lord&#8217;s interests.<h2 class=head1>V. HAVE YOU STARTED TO HAVE THE INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR COMPANION? HOW MANY TIMES?</h2><p>The real intimate and thorough fellowship with your companion is something particular. The fellowship you had in the past probably was not that intimate or that thorough. You have to open up yourself to your companion. Prayer is the way to rekindle your new man; spending time with the Lord is the way to refill your lamp; now you have to open yourself up to your companion.<h2 class=head1>VI. DO YOU KEEP YOUR REPENTING PRAYER CONTINUOUSLY?</h2><p>Repenting prayer is a particular kind of prayer which we must keep continuously. If there is any prayer without repenting, that prayer is nearly in vain. Medical doctors tell us that we should always wash our hands before eating. In the same way, we should not pray without repenting. Praying without repenting is like eating without washing our hands. Even if we do not lose our temper or speak evil words, we are still sinful. So when we come to pray, to take the spiritual food, we have to wash our hands, and to wash our hands is to repent. We should say, &#8220;Lord, I still need Your forgiveness, and I still need Your cleansing with Your precious blood.&#8221; Then we can pray. After our hands are washed, we can eat.<p>We all need some particular time to repent so that we can pray. The degree to which we can pray depends upon the degree to which we have repented. Daniel, in his book, has set up a good example. In Daniel 9 we see that he made a long repentance and confession when he prayed. While he was praying and confessing, he received a revelation of the seventy weeks, but Daniel 9 is mostly occupied with his confession. He repented and confessed not only for himself but also for his people and for his forefathers. So quite often when you repent for yourself, you have to repent for the church. Do not forget the church, because you are one with the church. If you are dirty, surely your church is dirty.<p>If you ask me how many times we should repent and confess, my answer is that the number of times is countless. We need to repent and confess throughout the day and every day. In a general way, we should first pray, &#8220;Lord, I still need Your forgiveness of grace. I still need Your cleansing with Your blood. Lord, particularly, I need Your forgiveness for my not walking strictly in the Spirit for the whole day.&#8221; This is a particular confession. Sometimes at the end of the day, I can recall that I was not in the Spirit in certain matters. Romans 8:4 says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit. Do you have the assurance that all day you do everything in the Spirit? I must tell you that no one can do this. But you can pray a prayer of repentance. No one can always keep his hands thoroughly clean, but he can wash his hands. We need a continuous washing in the precious blood of Christ (1 John 1:7).<p>A number of Christians think that as long as they believe in the Lord everything will be all right. They believe that Christ is their righteousness regardless of what sinful and worldly things they do. Such Christians, needless to say, are very loose and unhealthy. They have never seen, especially in the New Testament, that there will be a time of discipline for the loose Christians. The New Testament says that the unfaithful, loose Christians, at the Lord&#8217;s coming back, will be cast into outer darkness (Matt. 8:12; 25:30). Some may wonder how we believers who have been saved could be thrown into outer darkness. If we are walking, living, and behaving ourselves in darkness today, how could we hope that in the coming age the Lord will bring us directly into glory? The Bible is not a sugar-coated book. It is full of warnings. The book of Hebrews has five big warnings (2:1-4; 3:7-4:13; 5:11-6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29). We need to be vitalized so that we can be brought on to maturity to receive the Lord&#8217;s reward in the next age instead of His discipline. This is why we have to keep our repenting prayer continuously.<h2 class=head1>VII. HAVE YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADE A NAME LIST OF ALL YOUR POSSIBLE CANDIDATES?</h2><p>You and your companion need to make a name list of all your possible gospel candidates.<h2 class=head1>VIII. HAVE YOU ALL PRAYED FOR YOUR CANDIDATES AND RECEIVED THE LORD&#8217;S LEADING CONCERNING WHOM YOU SHOULD CONTACT?</h2><p>We need to pray for our candidates and receive the Lord&#8217;s leading concerning whom we should contact. Then we need to carry out the Lord&#8217;s leading by going to contact these ones.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION</h1><h2 class=head1>BEING BROUGHT OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT IS ROUTINE</h2><p>In this series of messages, I have the burden to help us get out of all kinds of formality and routine. We hate any kind of form; we hate formal meetings; we hate rituals; we hate routine meetings, routine prayer, routine speaking, routine reading, routine sharing, and routine prophesying. Anything that is routine, we hate. We want to be vitalized overcomers in the church life who are one with the Lord to conquer deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.<h2 class=head1>USING TRACTS IN OUR LABOR IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p>We are preparing a number of tracts for our labor in the gospel. The ones we have prepared thus far are entitled Our Faith, Our Gospel, Our Commission, and Our Meetings. When we visit new persons, they will wonder who we are and what we believe in. We can give them the tract entitled Our Faith to show them what we believe. They will realize from reading this that we are bona fide Christians. Then they may wonder what we preach. We can give them Our Gospel, which tells them what we preach. If they would like to know what we are doing, we can give them Our Commission, which speaks about our work. If they want to know what kind of church we attend, we can give them Our Meetings to show them how we meet. They will realize from reading this that we have home meetings, perfecting meetings, and church meetings to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, for building up the church. They will also see that we have ministry meetings for the release of God&#8217;s word. After reading these tracts, the new ones will be very clear about us and will have the peace to talk to us. These four tracts may be considered as the first series.<p>The second series of tracts which we will publish will be for our gospel preaching. These tracts will be concerning God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the Body of Christ, the local churches, and the oneness of the Body of Christ. God, Christ, the Spirit, and the eternal life are for producing the Body of Christ, the Body of Christ is expressed in local churches, and all the local churches should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.<p>Whenever we go out to visit people, whether they are Christians or unbelievers, we should bring all of these tracts. Then, as the Lord leads, we can give them a certain one to meet their particular need. We have to learn how to use these tracts in an effective way. We need to study what they say, so that we can have a conversation with the new ones about their contents. To ask a new one to read an entire tract together with us is awkward. That is the stale way. Instead, at a certain point in our conversation, we can read a portion of a particular paragraph to him. Then we can strengthen and confirm what we read in order to impress him. We should be familiar with all the appropriate verses in the Bible that are mentioned in these tracts. This is a practical part of our training in reaching people.<h2 class=head1>WHAT A VITAL GROUP IS</h2><p>Now I would like to ask, &#8220;What is a vital group?&#8221; You may say that a vital group is a group that is living, burning, and bearing fruit. But this may be a doctrinal answer without vision. Actually, a vital group is a group of normal Christians. Today most Christians are abnormal, including a number of us in the recovery. My burden in endeavoring to carry out the vital groups is to change the generation. When I went to Taiwan in 1984, I told the leading elders that I could not go on in the present dormant situation of the recovery. We need to come out of the deadness of Sardis (Rev. 3:1-2), the lukewarmness of Laodicea (vv. 14-16), and the barrenness of the degenerating believers (John 15:2a). I want to bring the recovery into another age with a new generation, a new people.<p>After reconsidering the holy Word, we found out the way in which Christians should serve and meet. This is the God-ordained way, the way ordained by God in the Bible. This way ordained by God has four steps. The first step is to preach the gospel to get sinners saved so that they can become members of Christ. This is the begetting stage to bring forth, to beget, members of Christ. When sinners repent, believe, and are regenerated, they become like newborn babes who need to be nourished by us. This brings us to the second stage, the feeding stage, the nourishing stage. After the feeding stage comes the teaching stage to educate them. The teaching stage takes a long time. Humanly speaking, an education takes six years for elementary school, six years for junior high and high school, and four years for college. Spiritually speaking, we also need to be educated in the divine truths for the Christian life and the church life. This is the teaching stage, which is called the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4:12. After a certain period of time, the saints become &#8220;graduates&#8221; in the church life. The length of time it takes to &#8220;graduate&#8221; differs with people according to their desire for the Lord, their endeavoring, and their capacity.<p>After the begetting stage, the nourishing stage, and the teaching stage comes the building stage. After you graduate from a four-year college, you have to do some business. Our business in the church life is to build up the church of Christ, the Body of Christ, by prophesying. This is fully developed and presented in 1 Corinthians 14. The church is not built by one minister, one preacher, speaking all the time. This concept came from the source of Satan to spoil the Body of Christ, to nullify the headship of Christ, and to make the church nothing. The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening does not build up the church, the Body of Christ. Instead, it builds up a hierarchy, a kind of religious system with rank and position. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that we should all desire to prophesy, to speak for the Lord (v. 1). Paul told us that we can all prophesy (v. 31). To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 means to speak for the Lord and to speak forth Christ. We need the variety from many saints speaking in the meetings. After a new one gets baptized he can say, &#8220;Praise the Lord Jesus! I love Him. He is so good to me.&#8221; In a family it is good to hear all the members of different ages speak, from the young children to the grandparents. The church life should be like this.<p>Thus, we have seen that God&#8217;s ordained way has four stages: the stages of begetting, feeding, teaching, and building. Nearly everybody in the recovery likes the God-ordained way, but when we actually begin to practice it step by step, we will be a changed generation. We will get out of the old generation and become a new generation. This is what I expect to see in the recovery-a change of generation. We must get out of the deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness. We must get out of the oldness, the staleness. We must get out of the routine, the formality, the silence, and the prayers of the traditional way. We hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness. We are struggling to fight them down. We need a change from the old way to the new way, from the old age to the new age in God&#8217;s ordained way with four steps: begetting, feeding, teaching, and building. We need a change of generation.<p>I would like to say again that a vital group is a group of normal Christians. A normal Christian always lives a holy life in the church. He lives in the Body. He does not save people into a denomination but into the church, into the Body. Because many of us were not saved in this way, we were not normal. A normal Christian lives the normal church life and preaches the gospel in a normal way to save people into the church, into the Body.<p>Normal Christians beget, bring forth, normal Christians. After hearing the preaching of the gospel, a person should be led to repent thoroughly. He should make a thorough confession before God of his mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, defects, transgressions, trespasses, sins, and evils. He should also ask forgiveness of anyone whom he has offended. Through this kind of repentance and confession, he will begin to have a close, intimate fellowship with the Lord and with his fellow believers. Then he can also be perfected concerning how to pray, how to read the Word of God, how to call on the Lord&#8217;s name, and how to exercise his spirit. Spontaneously, he will become vital-living, burning, and fruit-bearing. A vital person is one who repents to the uttermost, confesses thoroughly, contacts the Lord God intimately, and fellowships with his fellow Christians closely.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>BUILDING UP A HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:16-27; 1 Tim. 1:16</h1><h2 class=head1>OUR BURDEN IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>I treasure 1 Corinthians 9:16-27. This is the top portion in the Bible concerning our burden in preaching the gospel. I would like us to read these verses with much consideration.<h2 class=head2>Entrusted with a Stewardship</h2><p>Paul said, &#8220;For if I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship&#8221; (vv. 16-17). Paul had a burden and a responsibility. Preaching the gospel was not his boast but his duty. The Lord entrusted Paul with a stewardship and established him as a steward. The Greek word for stewardship is oikonomia, which is also the word for economy. Paul dispensed all the riches which he had received of the Lord to the needy ones in order to fulfill his stewardship.<h2 class=head2>Becoming All Things to All Men</h2><p>Verses 18 and 19 say, &#8220;What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may present the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more.&#8221; Paul enslaved himself to all the needy ones that he might gain them. Verses 20 through 22 say, &#8220;And to the Jews I became as a Jew in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (though I myself am not under law), that I might gain those under law. To those without law, as without law (though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ), that I might gain those without law. To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.&#8221; Paul became all things to all men. To the weak ones he became a weak one. He adapted himself to all things, that is, to different ways of eating and practice, for the sake of all men.<h2 class=head2>Partaking of the Gospel</h2><p>Verse 23 says, &#8220;And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.&#8221; How much we enjoy partaking of the gospel depends upon how much we share it with others. If we do not preach the gospel, we will have no enjoyment in the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we cannot partake of the gospel we have received. To receive the gospel is by faith, but to enjoy the gospel is by preaching. We have to preach the gospel to enjoy it. The more we preach, the more we enjoy. If we do not preach and do not bear any fruit, we are through in the enjoyment of the gospel.<h2 class=head2>Running on a Racecourse</h2><p>Verse 24 says, &#8220;Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? Run in this way, that you may lay hold.&#8221; Paul was like an Olympic athlete running in a race. He used the running on a racecourse to illustrate how he preached. He did not preach in a loose way but in an Olympic way, a very strict way. A person who competes in the Olympics must train and exercise in a very strict way. We must be the same in the gospel.<p>Paul said that we should run in such a way that we may receive the prize. We should remember that there is a reward as an incentive to our preaching. But we cannot preach the gospel loosely. We must endeavor to run in a strict way. If we consider this and compare ourselves to Paul, we have to admit that we are greatly lacking. We should not take the practice of the vital groups for the sake of the gospel in a light and loose way. If we are loose, there is no possibility for us to gain anything. The Lord has been speaking to us week after week and year after year. But many of us have not received the full benefit of His speaking. This is due to our looseness.<p>We should not do anything in a loose way. If we arrange the chairs, we should arrange them strictly. If we are ushering, we should oversee the place to which we are ushering people. We should make sure that everything is in order and is clean, neat, and attractive. We should also learn to eat our meals in a strict way. When we leave our table, we should place the chair under the table in its proper position. Our bedrooms, our work place, and everything related to us should be in a proper order. If we are loose and messy persons, we will preach the gospel in the same way. We may talk about preaching the gospel, but how do we preach? We may preach in a loose way without any endeavoring or desperation.<p>In 1953 I conducted a training in Taipei with one hundred twenty saints. This was the first training I had after coming out of mainland China. The first thing I touched in that training was the character of the trainees. I put out thirty items of a proper character which can make a person useful to the Lord (see the book entitled Character published by Living Stream Ministry). The first three items are genuineness, exactness, and strictness. To be genuine, exact, and strict is for running the Christian race to win the prize. A race on a racecourse has its regulations. We have to get ourselves exercised.<p>I have been under this kind of training and discipline for many years. If we do not exercise the proper discipline over ourselves, we can never be overcomers. The Lord Jesus was not a loose person. Once He fed five thousand people, not including the women and children, with just five loaves and two fish. If we had been there, we would have been excited. In our excitement we might have neglected all the leftovers. But the Lord Jesus told the disciples to gather all the leftovers (John 6:12). That shows the Lord&#8217;s strictness.<p>When He saw the five thousand, He told His disciples to have them sit down in groups of about fifty each (v. 10; Luke 9:14). Then He took the loaves and fish and fed them. To be seated is to be regulated. Without certain regulations, there would have been no way to feed the five thousand. All of them were very hungry and wanted to eat. If they rushed all at once to get the food, some people could have been trampled. When the Lord asked the disciples to have them sit down, this regulated them. When the disciples were going to distribute the food, they had a proper way with a good order. This shows that the Lord Jesus was very fine and detailed in His humanity.<p>We can also see the Lord&#8217;s fine humanity when He resurrected. When Peter entered the Lord&#8217;s tomb on the day of resurrection, he saw &#8220;the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart&#8221; (John 20:7). If we had been resurrected, we may have said, &#8220;Praise God! I am released! Hallelujah!&#8221; Then we would have thrown off our handkerchief and would have left everything in a mess in the tomb. But this is not what the Lord did. When the disciples came to His tomb, they saw the evidence that He had been resurrected. All the things left in the tomb were a testimony to the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. If these things had not been left there in a good order, it would have been difficult for Peter and John to believe (v. 8) that the Lord had not been taken away by someone but had risen by Himself. If the Lord had been taken away, nothing would have been left in a good order. This again shows us the Lord&#8217;s fine humanity. Our character needs to be transformed with this uplifted humanity. The Lord was almighty and infinite, but He never became loose. He was very fine and detailed, even in taking care of small things. We need to run the Christian racecourse in this way.<h2 class=head2>Exercising Self-control in All Things</h2><p>In verse 25 Paul said, &#8220;And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.&#8221; Paul exercised self-control in all things for the gospel&#8217;s sake in order to run the Christian race. He was not loose. This shows us that he endeavored like an Olympic athlete.<p>If you are disciplined, coached to contend, you must learn how to exercise self-control in everything-in drinking, in eating, in dressing, in combing your hair, in putting on your tie, and even in your laughing or weeping. I saw some brothers laughing uncontrollably and some sisters weeping without ceasing. We need to learn to exercise self-control in our laughing and weeping.<p>For sixty-eight years I have been under God&#8217;s training and my own self-control. This is what makes it possible for me to open up the Word. In 2 Timothy 2:15, Paul told Timothy that he had to learn to cut the word straight like in carpentry. We can expound the word of God in a proper way, in a straight way, by having ourselves exercised to do everything accurately.<p>When I was in Shanghai in 1947, a few of us co-workers were fellowshipping one day about our work. One sister who was a deaconess came to us in an excited way. She said, &#8220;Brother Lee, upstairs in the ceiling there is a big hole.&#8221; As she was speaking, she gestured with her hands to show me how big the hole was. I asked her, &#8220;How big?&#8221; She said, &#8220;This big!&#8221; The gesture with her hands was slightly smaller than before. I asked her again, &#8220;How big?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Like this.&#8221; I asked again, &#8220;How big?&#8221; She said, &#8220;About this big.&#8221; Each time I asked, the hole she described became smaller and smaller. Eventually, we found out that the hole in the ceiling was actually very small. If we apply this principle to ourselves, we will realize how inaccurate we are.<p>I was able to compose those thirty items of the character training by my learning. We need to be trained not merely with Bible knowledge. We want to be trained to grow in life. The things of life grow according to regulation. All kinds of fruit are shaped according to the regulation of the life within them. The shaping takes place by the growth of life. Life regulates. We need to be trained to grow in the Lord&#8217;s life. Then we will be regulated. Because of the fall, our humanity is unregulated, so there is still the need of some outward training, which we call character training.<p>We should be genuine, exact, and strict not only in the church meetings and church service but also in our daily life and in our private life. Where do we put our shoes after we take them off? This shows what kind of character we have. Everything related to how we dress and comb our hair should be proper. We should be clean and neat, and our room with our furniture should also be clean and neat. We should polish our shoes and dust our furniture. Paul said that we Christians are like those who run on a racecourse. To run is to exercise. Even if we use a broom to sweep a certain area, we should not do it loosely and lazily. We should sweep in a strict and diligent way. If we do not take care of things in such a way, this shows our looseness and laziness.<p>When we go to contact people, we should not go loosely. We must run the racecourse. We should contact them in the right atmosphere and with the right gestures. Our whole being should be exercised to be proper and appropriate in our contact with others. If a young brother is speaking to a man who is about sixty, the way he sits and talks to this man should be in a very respectful manner. He should not sit before this man in a loose way. We have to run the racecourse by exercising self-control in all things. This renders the effectiveness to our preaching. Whether our conversation with a gospel candidate can be effective or not depends upon how we behave ourselves, even how we seat ourselves and what our gestures are. We must take this fellowship as a principle.<h2 class=head2>Buffeting Our Body and Making It Our Slave</h2><p>Paul said, &#8220;I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved&#8221; (vv. 26-27). Because Paul made his body his slave, he could be enslaved to anyone. He buffeted his body to subdue it, to enslave it. Sometimes we excuse ourselves from serving the Lord by saying that we are tired. But we have to buffet our body and make it our slave to contact people for the Lord&#8217;s interests.<h2 class=head1>PAUL BEING A PATTERN TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>We may wonder how we could ever compare to the apostle Paul. But Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:16 that he was saved as the top sinner to be a pattern to all the believers. This indicates that we should do what Paul did. He is a pattern. If there is no possibility for us to be like him, his word is in vain, and this verse should not be in the Bible. But he told us clearly that God has set him up as a pattern to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus. Today we are the believers in Christ, and we all can be like Paul.<p>How can we be vital? We have to run the race. Have you begun to run? If not, the vital groups are just vain talk among us. I sympathize with many of us. I know that we may have difficult jobs with long hours, but we should not excuse ourselves too much. We have to labor. On this whole earth, everyone is busy. We have to be like those in the Olympics. We must discipline ourselves, exercise self-control, and buffet our body to enslave and subdue it. If we do not take this way to run, I do not believe the vital groups can be among us. The vital groups cannot be with those who are loose, lazy, or sloppy.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING TO CONTACT PEOPLE</h2><p>From now on we all have to run the race by practicing to contact people. This is not an easy thing, because we do not have this habit and practice. We need to have a change in our natural being. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we were born to be a certain way. We may have been born to be a certain way, but we have been born again. We have had a second birth. We have been regenerated. Our being generated made us an old creation, but in regeneration God has made us a new creation, so we must be new persons.<p>After regeneration, we experience transformation. Transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment, but an inward, metabolic change. A number of us were born as persons who cannot contact people easily. But this training requires us to have an inward change, a transformation. We need to pray, &#8220;Lord, grant me to have a change in contacting people. I don&#8217;t like to contact people. I don&#8217;t like to be invited by others to contact them, nor do I like to invite people to contact me. I don&#8217;t have this kind of disposition. Lord, You know I don&#8217;t have this capacity. So You have to transform me, Lord.&#8221; We have to cooperate with the Lord to be transformed.<p>I would propose that from tomorrow morning you begin to contact people by using the telephone. Before you drive away from your home, you can make at least one phone call to someone. This will begin to build you up with a habit to contact people, to know people, and to become interested in people.<p>We also need to contact people before and after the church meetings, especially the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting. This can be the best time for us to contact people. On Saturday we could call a certain brother and say to him, &#8220;Brother, I have seen you quite often, but I have not had a time to talk with you. How about we come to the meeting tomorrow half an hour earlier to have some fellowship for about twenty minutes?&#8221; This kind of contact with the saints helps a lot.<p>After the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting is also a good time to contact people. I have observed that many brothers and sisters contact only their familiar acquaintances after the meeting. They do not go to contact the new ones in the meeting. Thus, the new ones are left as orphans. Before the meeting and after the meeting we should create an intimate and loving atmosphere in the hall. When the new ones come in, they should be able to sense the warm care and intimacy among us. A new one may not have even heard the gospel yet. He may not even have believed yet. But he will be impressed with the loving atmosphere, the intimate atmosphere, among the saints in the meeting hall.<p>When we contact the saints and the new ones in this way, it helps us to function in the meeting; it makes it easier for us to prophesy. Suppose I come every Lord&#8217;s Day morning, yet I do not contact anyone, and no one contacts me. Then every face looks cold to me. When I stand up to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, it is difficult because the people seem so cold. After speaking a little bit in such a cold atmosphere, it will be hard for me to continue. But if everyone is so familiar to me, some will smile at me while I am sharing. Their smiling tells me to &#8220;sail on&#8221; in my speaking for the Lord. We must have such an atmosphere in the church meeting, an atmosphere in which people know that we really love one another. We are really a big, loving, intimate family with brothers, sisters, and parents. Some older ones are really our parents in the Lord (Rom. 16:13; 1 Cor. 4:15).<p>No human being likes to be isolated. We all like to be flocked together. But in human society, where is a pure flock of people who love one another in an incorruptible way with much encouragement, building up, and help? Every human being would like to join such a group. I feel that we are lacking the proper atmosphere in our church meetings. We need to create such a loving atmosphere in our start of contacting people. We can make appointments with people for the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting by calling them on the telephone. We should try to do this.<p>We should also try to invite people to our home and be invited by others to their home. The Lord&#8217;s blessing will follow us if we practice this in a loving and intimate way. If a brother received a number of invitations every week, he might not be able to go, but these invitations would encourage him and make him buoyant.<p>The Lord charged His people, His disciples, to love one another (John 13:34). He brought a group of Galileans together to follow Him every day for three and a half years. They dropped their jobs and followed the Lord Jesus all the time. The Lord blended them together. In the Acts and the Epistles, we can see that the early apostles also carried out the same kind of blending among the saints. I am burdened to help us become blended together. We can do this by three ways: by calling others on the telephone, by contacting others on the Lord&#8217;s Day morning, and by inviting others to our home and being invited by others to their home.<p>When we invite others to our home, we do not have to prepare a rich feast. We should just prepare a simple meal. We are not getting together for eating. We are coming together for blending. When we come together, we talk about the Lord Jesus, about His holy Word, and about our spiritual experiences. This kind of contact will revolutionize the church. We will convert the church into a new one.<p>In the last message, we spoke of the Lord&#8217;s need to have a new generation. This cannot take place merely by prayer but by our contacting of people. You should contact me, I should contact you, and we all should contact one another every day, every week, every month, and every year. When we contact one another, we are meeting. To meet is to blend, and to blend is to know each other. Whoever shepherds the Lord&#8217;s flock should know every sheep.<p>We need to be trained to contact people. If a brother is very cold toward the Lord, how can we make him burning? We can invite him to our home or go to visit him. One day the Lord washed His disciples&#8217; feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost (John 13:1), and He charged His disciples to do the same to one another in love (vv. 14, 34). Today, the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated. For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing with the washing Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5) and the washing word (Eph. 5:26). This can be carried out when we contact one another in love. Our contact with people should not be formal and official but normal and living in every way.<p>If certain saints are not coming to the church meetings, we can begin to visit them once a week or once a month in a regular way according to what their situation allows. We can give them some copies of the gospel tracts we have published. We can read a phrase or a paragraph to them. Maybe this will stir them up and give them a desire to come to the meetings. There are many ways to shepherd people. My point is this-we need to build up a habit of contacting others. We should not be limited in our contact. If we have the burden to visit our relatives and acquaintances who are unbelievers, we should do this. We need to practice this one lesson-to contact people.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEED IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY TODAY TO BUILD UP THE HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:15-17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-2; S. S. 1:8</h1><h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDS IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>We have to build up a habit of contacting people. In Song of Songs 1:8 the Lord said to His follower, &#8220;Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds&#8217; tents.&#8221; This verse indicates that we have to run after the Lord. While we are running, we have to take care of some younger ones, who are our kids. We are to bring them to the tents where the shepherds are and where the people of God meet with the Chief Shepherd.<p>The Gospel of John, which is a Gospel on life, also speaks of the need of shepherding. By the end of chapter twenty, the Gospel of John is actually concluded, yet there is still one more chapter as an appendix, chapter twenty-one. The main thing in this appendix is the Lord Jesus spending time to shepherd Peter. Peter suffered a big defeat. Only a short time before John 21, he was boasting by telling the Lord, &#8220;Lord, everyone may reject You, but I will not. I will follow You to the end.&#8221; Then the Lord told him, &#8220;Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times&#8221; (Matt. 26:34). Peter responded, &#8220;Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You&#8221; (v. 35). No doubt, by that time Peter did not believe that he could ever deny the Lord. After his terrible failure that night, he wept bitterly (v. 75).<p>When the Lord Jesus resurrected, how could Peter face Him once again? The days must have been difficult for Peter after he denied the Lord. He was taking the lead among the disciples throughout the three and a half years of the Lord&#8217;s earthly ministry. Then he had a great failure. He even denied the Lord to a young servant girl (vv. 69-70). The Lord surely knew that Peter was down. After his failure, he took the lead to go back to his old profession of fishing in order to make a living (John 21:3).<p>When the Lord restored Peter, He reminded him of His desire to have a flock. In 1 Peter 5:4 Peter called the Lord Jesus &#8220;the Chief Shepherd.&#8221; Hebrews 13:20 says that Christ is the great Shepherd, and the Lord Himself told us in John 10:11 that He is the good Shepherd. Thus, He is the Chief Shepherd, the great Shepherd, and the good Shepherd. First Peter 2:25 tells us that this Chief Shepherd is the Shepherd of our souls. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Our Lord shepherds us mainly by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person. But do you think that the Lord Jesus by Himself can shepherd so many flocks of sheep? As the Chief Shepherd, He must have a flock of shepherds under Him. We are not just flocks of sheep but flocks of shepherds.<p>When the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him, he responded by saying, &#8220;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You&#8221; (John 21:15-16). After the Lord asked him this the third time, Peter could only say, &#8220;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You&#8221; (v. 17). After each of Peter&#8217;s three responses, the Lord told him, &#8220;Feed My lambs....Shepherd My sheep....Feed My sheep&#8221; (vv. 15-17). No doubt, this gave Peter a strong impression that he could never forget. This was the reason that in his first Epistle he touched the matter of shepherding. He told us that Christ was the Chief Shepherd and that he was one of the many shepherds under the Chief Shepherd. He also told us that the Lord is the Shepherd of our soul, our real person. That was his experience when the Lord restored him in John 21.<p>Some may think that the Lord Jesus went to the seashore in John 21 to help the disciples get some fish for eating. But Peter realized that this was not the Lord&#8217;s intention. The Lord&#8217;s intention was to touch Peter, to shepherd his soul. At that time his soul was really suffering. His soul could not have been happy after denying the Lord. The disciples caught 153 fish (v. 11), but Peter did not care for that because of his failure. Because the Lord knew this, He shepherded Peter in his soul. Later, Peter said that he was one of the shepherds, and he exhorted his fellow elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-3).<p>Now I would like us to consider what the church needs today. The biggest lack, the biggest shortage, is in the eldership, because the elders should be the shepherds among God&#8217;s people. Because there are no elders, most of the sheep in the Lord&#8217;s flock are wanderers. Millions of Christians are wandering in the wilderness. Who is taking care of them? They do not have any shepherding. Even if there are some shepherds, they concentrate mostly on outward affairs; they do not shepherd people&#8217;s souls.<p>In the past we may have thought that we need to shepherd people&#8217;s spirits. We stress the spirit of man, and we tell people to reject the soul. But we need to realize that the saints&#8217; problems are with their soul. We may feel that if their spirit is strong, there will be no problem. But how could their spirit be strong when they have a lot of problems in their soul? Thus, we have to learn how to shepherd their souls, how to touch their souls. Today on this earth, there is not one person who does not have any problem in his soul. This is why I encourage you all to open up yourself to your fellow brothers so that the Lord can have a way to shepherd your soul. We need this kind of shepherding.<p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery in the United States has come to a point where we cannot go on further without the shepherding. If we are hot for the Lord to the extent that we are burning, we will pick up the burden to contact people. Even though we may not know how to contact others, we will learn by doing. I can never forget a story about D. L. Moody. He once made a vow to preach the gospel to at least one person each day. Late one night, close to midnight, he was about to go to bed when he remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day. He went out into the street to find someone to whom he could speak before the day was over. He found a policeman and exhorted him to believe in the Lord. The policeman rebuked him angrily, and Moody hurried home, but within a few days this policeman was saved. Because D. L. Moody had made such a vow, he built up a habit of contacting people. We need to be the same. In these days the Lord needs flocks of shepherds to shepherd His flocks. We all have to be the shepherds who are burdened to contact people.<p>The Lord&#8217;s people everywhere have been scattered because there is no shepherding. We must realize that our shepherding should not be initiated by our care for people. John 21 reveals that our shepherding should be initiated from our love to Christ. We desire to contact people because we love the Lord, knowing that He loves people. Nothing can please the Lord as much as our going out to shepherd His flock. I assure you that if you contact people regularly, this will make you happy because the Lord is happy.<p>Shepherding should not be initiated from our purpose. It should be initiated from our loving the Lord. The Lord asked Peter if he loved Him. When Peter said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, You know,&#8221; the Lord told him to feed His lambs. He again asked Peter if he loved Him. Since Peter said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, You know,&#8221; He told Peter to shepherd His sheep. The Lord asked Peter a third time if he loved Him. When Peter said again, &#8220;Lord, You know,&#8221; the Lord told him to feed His sheep. Peter failed the Lord three times, and the Lord asked him if he loved Him three times. His speaking to Peter indicated to him that he should forget about his failure and take care of the Lord&#8217;s lambs and sheep.<p>Today what is needed in the recovery is for us to rise up to shepherd others. We need to contact people of our own age group. If I tried to contact the teenagers, they might run away from me. But if our young people go to contact other young people, no one will run from them. If we sent older ones to the campuses, it would be difficult for them to contact the young students. I am sharing this to encourage the young people among us. Do not say that you are too young. It is wonderful to be young, because this gives you a way to contact other young people.<p>Today the church&#8217;s need is shepherding. My burden is to stir you up that you may realize that today the Lord&#8217;s recovery needs you to rise up to contact people. You have to build up a habit. If you do not contact people, you cannot be satisfied. You should even become addicted to the Lord&#8217;s love to take care of His people.<p>I want to remind you to make a list of all your acquaintances. You may think that you do not know that many people, but when you make a list, you may find out that you have over a hundred people whom you know. You should pray over these names, seeking the Lord&#8217;s leading as to whom you should contact. Sometimes when you contact someone, you may feel that he is the wrong person. But according to my experience, no contacts are wrong. Do not say that you caught a fish which is the wrong fish. No fish is wrong, as long as it was hooked by you. The only thing that is wrong is for you not to contact people. You may feel that a certain man is the wrong person because he is too proud. But you have to check with yourself. Are you not proud? On this earth, who is not proud? Even the little children know how to be proud. If we are waiting to contact the best people, the perfect people, we will have no one to contact. No contacts are wrong. Even the policeman which D. L. Moody contacted close to midnight was the right person.<p>We can also see from George Muller&#8217;s autobiography that no person would not believe in the Lord Jesus if you keep contacting him continuously for your whole life. George Muller prayed for many gospel candidates. When he went to the Lord, all of them except one was saved. Eventually, even that one was saved. This is why I say you need the patience. You should always try to have four or five people under your care. You may be led to contact someone who has no feeling to pursue the Lord. Still you should keep contacting him in a regular way. After five years the &#8220;tide&#8221; to be interested in the Lord Jesus will come to this man. You may contact someone in the spring, and he may not have any heart for the Lord. But after half a year, the tide will come for him to desire the Lord.<p>I was saved in this way. Although I was raised in Christianity, I did not believe in the Lord Jesus until I was nineteen years old. My sister loved the Lord and prayed for me. She recommended me to a Chinese pastor. This pastor came to see me once a week for a number of months. He would simply say, &#8220;Come to our church on Sunday.&#8221; I nodded my head, but I would not go. Eventually, on the second day of the Chinese New Year, I suddenly decided to go to the Chinese Independent Church, the church of the pastor who came to visit me. It was through this that I heard the proper preaching of the gospel and was saved.<p>It is no wonder that the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:58 that our labor for Christ will never be in vain. The Bible also tells us that we may sow and others may harvest; also, others may sow and we may harvest (John 4:37-38). Only the Lord knows to whom the credit should be given. Therefore, we must have a burden and build up a habit to contact people. Every day we should contact people. I told you already not to expect quick fruit. Any fruit produced quickly is artificial. Artificial flowers can be produced overnight, but real flowers take a number of months to grow and blossom.<p>According to the New Testament teaching, the first burden, the first responsibility, of the believers is to get people. John is a book on life. In chapter fifteen the Lord, who is life, tells us that we are His branches (v. 5). The job, the profession, and the responsibility of a branch is to bear fruit. When we abide in Him, we bear fruit. To abide in Him means to enjoy Him. If we do not bear fruit, the Father, who is the Cultivator, will take us away (v. 2). Then we will lose the position to enjoy Christ. Very few Christians are abiding in Christ, because they do not bear fruit. To recover your enjoyment of Christ is to bear fruit. If you have not been revived, go to contact people for one or two weeks, and you can be revived.<h2 class=head1>SOME PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTACTING PEOPLE</h2><p>First, we must pick up the burden and make a definite resolution to contact people. We must build ourselves up with a new habit to contact people. In the bank, in the supermarket, on the street, and everywhere we need to practice contacting people until it becomes our habit. Probably a number of us have found out that we are not used to contacting people. When we see people approaching us on the street, we may turn away from them. Instead, we should always grasp the opportunity to talk to people. We should always keep gospel tracts in our pocket so that we can give them to the ones whom we contact.<p>When we go to visit people, we must learn to behave ourselves properly. Before going out to visit people, we must make sure that we dress properly to have a proper appearance. We need to be adjusted by the Lord in the way that we talk and in our gestures so that we can reach people. We should not be loose in anything. Contacting people properly is not an easy thing.<p>Always wait till your contact opens up. It is always a help to listen to him. Eventually, you can let him know that you are a Christian, not a preacher, and that you love the Lord Jesus. Always wait to see how he would respond to you. You may find out that it would be appropriate to read a few paragraphs from the booklet The Mystery of Human Life with him. Or you may feel it is better to give him the tract entitled God. You should get yourself acquainted with the contents of these gospel tracts so that you can impart them into the new ones. We need to learn much in order to be effective in taking care of people.<p>Also, you should learn never to argue or debate with people. Argument and debate never work out anything. On the other hand, you should not agree with people too quickly nor should you agree with whatever they say. Otherwise, they may think that you are a &#8220;yes man.&#8221; You have to show people your carefulness. When you are not loose and careless, this will add weight to your speaking. Otherwise, the other party may consider that your speaking is a light word with no gravity, no weight.<p>You may approach one man who is in a hurry to do something. If you realize this, you should not sit down and occupy his time. Take the chance to say a quick word and give him a tract. Then you can say, &#8220;This will help you to know the Savior, Jesus Christ. Have a good day. Bye.&#8221; This is good enough. He will appreciate this because he is hurrying to leave. If you try to sit down at this time, you will bother and even offend him. At another time, you may realize that a certain person wants to have some time with you. That is the time for you to sit down to talk to him slowly and gradually for fifteen minutes or maybe half an hour.<p>In contacting people it is always a help to make appointments. But this does not mean that we should contact people only by making appointments. We should talk to people at any time. The Lord Himself is the factor, the reason, and the purpose for us to go out to contact people. He will honor our doing, and today He is the Spirit within us. When we go to contact people, we have to believe that the Lord is going with us. Our speaking is His speaking. We speak Him into people. We should never forget to minister Christ to others. We should never forget to pass on God, the living God, to people. Even if we just speak with someone for one minute, we should still minister Christ and pass on God to him.<p>One more critical thing for us to learn is the right time to ask someone to pray with us. This can be compared to cooking food. You have to know what time to stop cooking. Otherwise, what you cook can be spoiled by being either raw or overdone. All good cooks know when to stop their cooking. After one big gospel meeting, D. L. Moody contacted a person who was an unbeliever. At the critical moment of time when the person was about to pray, another person came in. It was raining outside and this person came in with an umbrella. A noise was made with the umbrella which distracted the other person. After that disturbance, the person would not pray to receive the Lord. This shows how important it is to pray with people at the right time.<p>To touch the Lord may be likened to the installation of electricity. A house may have all the wires, but if the wires are not properly connected, it cannot have any electricity. To contact people is like connecting the wires so that the electricity can come in. We all have to learn not to talk too little or too much with our gospel candidates. We have to have a heart to learn all these things as we exercise to contact people. What we need in these days is not more doctrine but practice. We have to learn to contact people, not in a general way but in a practical way.<p>We may make mistakes as we contact others, but we need to realize that sometimes even our mistakes fulfill the Lord&#8217;s purpose. If we do not do anything, we can never fulfill the Lord&#8217;s purpose. Although we may be wrong, He may still bless us. Still, we all have to learn to be practical. While we are speaking with someone, we should sense what kind of person he is and what he needs. Then we can respond to him and give him something that meets his particular need. When we contact people, we should always have the goal of contacting them continuously.<p>You also have to learn not to spend your time in vain. When you contact people, you should always discern whether or not you should make this person a constant contact. To invite people to dinner is good, but you should not do this too quickly or too early. After a number of contacts you may realize that the time is ripe for you to invite someone to your house or for you to be invited by him. All of your contact with people should not be carried out in a light or loose way.<p>Furthermore, you should always pray for your contacts. Do not say that you do not have the time. Even if you are really busy, you can still pray while you are walking out the door, &#8220;Lord, help me today to meet the proper person.&#8221; As you are driving to work you can continue to pray. This is the real prayer, not the routine prayer. Surely it is good to have a set time to pray, but praying while you are walking out the door or driving to work in your car may be even more effective. Wherever you are, you can pray. Remember all your contacts before the Lord, and pray for them.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>AWAKE, SLEEPER, AND ARISE FROM THE DEAD, AND CHRIST WILL SHINE ON YOU</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:14</h1><p>In this message I would like us to pay our attention to Ephesians 5:14, which says, &#8220;Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&#8221; Even though we have released a number of messages concerning the practice of the vital groups, my burden has not yet been discharged. The speaking Spirit is very keen. He knows much better than we do. The speakers for the Lord always have this kind of experience. We may feel okay about what we have shared and what we have heard, but the speaking Spirit says, &#8220;No, the burden is still not discharged.&#8221;<p>If you are going to burn a house, you cannot burn it unless you get the right spot. If you put a little gasoline on that spot and start the fire, the entire house will burn. In order to stay burning for the Lord, to stay vitalized, we must also come back to the right spot.<p>In this message I want to come back to the very root of the vital groups. Whether or not we have started the practice of the vital groups depends upon our experience of this root. I have a deep concern that not many have really started the vital groups. Instead, you may take the teaching as an outward way and try to put it into practice. But this is not right and does not work.<h2 class=head1>GOING TO THE LORD TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY HIM</h2><p>From the beginning I have pointed out that you should not form a vital group. You have to produce a group, not form one. How do you do this? You do not do it by the way of a movement or by the way of propaganda. The way to produce a vital group is by you yourself going to the Lord. You should have a burden because you see that you are old, dead, lukewarm, fruitless, pitiful, and numb, with no feeling. This should cause you to go to the Lord to repent. This is the very start of the vital group. I say again-go to the Lord. Without going to the Lord by yourself, what you do means nothing.<p>You may get some help from the fellowship on the vital groups, but that is not what the Lord wants. What the Lord wants is for you to have a new start by realizing your need. You may desire to be vitalized, yet you may not feel that you have any need. But consider the people of this world who need the Lord, yet not one of them realizes it. This is why we have to go to preach the gospel to them to stir up their heart and to open their eyes to see something. Then from within they realize that they need the Lord. The first thing we should point out to them is that they must contact the Lord. Even if they do not have a heart for this, they still need to do it. We are the same way. We may not feel that we have a need, but we surely do have a need. We must go to the Lord. He is the source that can render us a real start.<p>You may go to Him once, and nothing will happen. Maybe even after twenty times, nothing will happen. That might disappoint you. But our experience tells us that if we keep going to the Lord, sooner or later, He will shine on us. He is the light (1 John 1:5). Go to Him, and light will shine on you. The light might not shine today, but it will tomorrow. Throughout the Bible, there is always a call to go to the Lord (John 7:37; Isa. 2:5; 55:1; Matt. 11:28). Even at the end of the Bible there is a call to all the thirsty ones to come to the Lord (Rev. 22:17). We must go to Him and contact Him. I cannot enlighten you. What can enlighten you is God Himself. You must go to Him.<p>The Lord has shown us that the only way for us to go on is to come back to His Word, and His Word tells us that He ordained a way in the New Testament for us to take. He has shown us that we cannot take this way as a form or a ritual. If we do, we are just dropping an old ritual and picking up a new one. You hate the old routine, but you love the new routine. We do not want to pick up another routine. This is why you have to go to the Lord directly.<p>I have said that you have to get a companion. But you should not go to get a companion before going to the Lord. You must have a start by going to the Lord until He enlightens you, until He shines on you. Then you will fully realize where you are and what you are. Spontaneously, you will begin to repent by saying, &#8220;Lord, I am dead.&#8221; While you are saying you are dead, the Lord will say, &#8220;You are dead because you are sinful. You are dead because you are dirty and filthy.&#8221; The Lord will shine on you and show you that you are like a person buried under the earth with layer upon layer of dirt. You have to get out of that by making a thorough and detailed confession to the Lord so that you can be forgiven, washed, and released to emerge from the depths of your fall. This thorough repentance and thorough confession will bring you into an intimate fellowship with the Lord. You must start the vital groups in this way.<p>If you have started from here, you then need to get a companion. Before going to get a companion, you need to pray. Do not do this hastily. If you do this hastily, you will not gain someone who is a real companion. You have to pray, &#8220;Lord, give me someone as a companion or send someone to me. Lord, You lead me. Bring me into contact with the one whom You choose.&#8221; Everything in the God-ordained way is always by prayer, not by our initiation or by our activity. Do not think you can get a companion within a short time. You need to spend more time to pray. Do not believe that just by one contact you can get a companion.<p>Everything that is living, that has life, always takes time to produce. For a child to be born requires nine months from his conception. If you sow a seed into the earth, it does not grow up the next day. Anything produced overnight is artificial. If you sow a seed, you have to wait awhile for something to spring up out of the earth.<p>I have a real concern that we have not yet started the vital groups from the root. The vital groups have not started yet because no one would start from the root by himself. A husband&#8217;s wife cannot help him in this matter, nor can the husband help his wife. Do not look for anyone to help you. The only one who can help you is the Lord Himself. You must go to Him directly by yourself.<p>I want to see that each of you is fully enlightened by God. You need to go to Him. Even if you have not been enlightened by Him, you still have to go to Him. He is the real source for you to start. If you go to Him again and again, He will shine upon you. He will enlighten you. He will bring you into the light. He will expose you to the uttermost. Then you will repent to the uttermost and even weep before the Lord. You will tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I am so dirty and sinful. I am rotten and corrupted.&#8221; Spontaneously, you will make a thorough confession to the Lord. You may confess to such an extent that you would forget to eat. While you are driving to your office, you may still be repenting to the Lord with tears. I wonder how many of us have passed through this stage. If you have not passed through this stage, the vital group has not started yet.<p>The God-ordained way is not a matter of hearing some teaching, going to get another brother, and then making a decision to go out to visit people. This is an outward work, not the carrying out of the vital groups. We did things like this in the past to gain people, but where are these people today? Most of them were not remaining fruit.<p>To have the vital groups you must be like a person sowing the seed. You have to contact the Lord. You have to be enlightened. You have to be touched by the Lord. You have to be exposed in His presence. You have to make a confession to Him. You have to have yourself fully saturated by Him. Then you will have a very close relationship with Him and an intimate fellowship with Him. This is the start of the vital groups. Then you spontaneously will pray, &#8220;Lord, I need a companion. Prepare a companion for me. I don&#8217;t like to select one. I don&#8217;t want to exercise my choice, my preference, anymore. You lead me. You bring me someone or send me to someone.&#8221;<p>I am very sorry today when I see your present situation. It seems that you have been moved, but you do not move. This is because you have not gone to the Lord. If you do not go to the Lord and have a thorough repentance and confession in His presence, you are deceiving yourselves. Repenting and confessing must be done by yourself. Having an intimate fellowship with the Lord must be done by yourself. Without these three things, you will remain the same until you see the Lord at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10).<p>We should not read the Lord&#8217;s Word in a light way. Instead, we should tremble at His word (Isa. 66:5a). Ephesians 5:14 says that the sleepers should awake and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on them. We need to consider ourselves in the light of this verse. Are we sleeping? You may still be sleeping, and yet claim to practice the vital groups. That is not the practice of the vital groups. That is a new routine. According to the speaking Spirit within me, I feel that we have not yet had a real start in the vital groups.<p>God is the source. You must go to Him to contact Him. Please take my word and bring this word back to the Lord. You can pray, &#8220;Lord, I have heard that we haven&#8217;t started the vital groups yet. Lord, I come to You. Tell me how to start a vital group.&#8221; Right away the light will be there, because God is light. To go to the Lord is the first principle in carrying out the vital groups.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING THE IMPERATIVES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>We also need to realize a second principle. This second principle is that there are many imperatives in the New Testament which tell us what to do. All the words spoken concerning the overcomers are imperative. When Paul said, &#8220;Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead,&#8221; this was an imperative. You have to do it. The book of Revelation is a particular book full of imperatives for those who desire to overcome. The Lord charges those in Laodicea to buy from Him gold refined by fire that they may be rich, white garments that they may cover their nakedness, and eyesalve to anoint their eyes that they may see (Rev. 3:18). No one would give these things to you. You have to buy them at a cost; you have to pay the price. From the beginning of the New Testament to the end, every step of God&#8217;s grace to us is imperative. We are told to repent and believe into the Lord Jesus. This is imperative. The Lord Jesus tells us to come to Him. This is imperative. No one can do it for you. You have to do it.<p>Second Timothy 1 says that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice. He has not given us a weak, &#8220;wishy-washy&#8221; spirit. But God has given us a spirit of power, with a strong will, a spirit of love, with a loving emotion, and a spirit of sobermindedness, with a clear mind (v. 7). You must be strong in your will. All the followers of Christ, all the martyrs of the Lord, are people with a strong will. You cannot be wishy-washy. If you are, you can do nothing. We, the seekers of the Lord, must learn to be strong in our will. Because I have received a vision and am under the Lord&#8217;s enlightenment, I have to be strong for the Lord&#8217;s interests.<p>I say again that you must have a time to go to the Lord. You must go to the Lord again and again until you get the enlightenment and are exposed in His light. If you come to Him, He will expose you, and you will repent and confess. Then you will be brought into His intimate fellowship. This will make you vital. To be vital is not a matter of shouting some slogans or of carrying out some movement. To hear the fellowship concerning the vital groups and then to go to do it in ourselves is a movement. It means nothing. Only one thing counts-for you to contact the Lord by yourself. To do it with anyone else will be a frustration to you. You must go to Him directly by yourself. A thorough confession can be made to the Lord only by yourself.<p>I hope that we would take this fellowship and receive the imperatives from the Lord in His Word. I can tell you that you need to repent, but I cannot repent for you. I can prepare the food for you, but I cannot eat the food for you. No one can eat for you. You can be charged to eat, but you still need to eat for yourself. My duty, my responsibility, and my ministry is to tell you that you need to eat. If you do not take this word, then whatever you hear means nothing. Today we are in a stage in which we need to be vital. We need to be living, burning, and fruitful. Who can do this for us? Only the Lord Himself. What we need in this stage is to go to the Lord directly. We have to look to the Lord for a time that we can go to Him.<p>I would like to give you a short testimony of my experience in this matter. I was with the Brethren for more than six years-from 1925 to 1931-when the Lord shined on me in a particular way. In August of 1931 while I was walking on the street, something deep within me said, &#8220;You have been with the Brethren for all these years. You have gone to meeting after meeting and have heard message after message. But look at how dead you are. In these years you didn&#8217;t bring one person to the Lord.&#8221; I was really bothered by this realization. The next morning, I went to the top of a hill to spend some time alone with the Lord. I wept and prayed, &#8220;Lord, have mercy upon me. What shall I do?&#8221; That was something vital. I did that every day for quite some time.<p>After a number of months, an intimate friend of mine who was a very dear brother in the Lord came from Shanghai. He had gone to Shanghai to do some business and had stayed there for a few years. He told me about the meeting of the church in Shanghai. I sent word through him to Brother Watchman Nee that I would like to invite him to come to our town. Later, he came and held a conference in our denomination. The day after he left, the Lord sent someone to me and we spontaneously became companions. That was the start of the church in my hometown. We two became vital. There was no need for us to go to people. The Lord sent people one by one to come to contact us. Just after two weeks&#8217; time, we had eleven brothers coming together to take the Lord&#8217;s table. That was a vitalized situation.<p>There is the need of a real start among us today. There must be some contact between you and the Lord. When I had my times with the Lord on the top of that hill, I had to repent and confess. This brought me into an intimate fellowship with the Lord. I did this day by day for a number of weeks. What I have been teaching here is according to what I have experienced. The many teachings which I had received from the Brethren did not help me in the matter of life. It was not until the Lord shined upon me that I began to be brought into the pathway of life.<p>You may say, &#8220;Well, the Lord has not come to me yet.&#8221; But I would say, &#8220;The Lord is waiting for you. You need to go to Him.&#8221; The Lord is within you, but you may not care to listen to Him. He is speaking all the time. You need to stop yourself from all other things. Go to a closed room, to a mountaintop, or to some other place to be with the Lord for a personal time. The only thing that has helped me and that can help you is to contact the Lord directly. No one can escape from the Lord&#8217;s presence. He is the source. Go to Him and you will be enlightened.<h2 class=head1>GOING TO THE LORD IN A SINCERE WAY WITHOUT COMPROMISING</h2><p>You must take care of another principle in your fellowship with the Lord. When you go to the Lord, you must be sincere. You must not try to avoid the Lord by choosing the easy way or by compromising. That means you sell yourself cheaply. When you go to the Lord, you have to say amen to whatever He speaks to you.<p>Do not say that you cannot do something or that you can do something. We cannot do anything in ourselves, but we can trust in Him. This is a great gift. The babe does not need to cook, but the babe should trust in the mother&#8217;s cooking. Our problem is that we either do not do anything or that we try by ourselves to do it. Both are wrong. Do not do it, but trust in Him. Then He will do it for you all the time. Paul said that he was able to do all things in the One who empowered him (Phil. 4:13). He told us clearly that we could do nothing, but he also told us that we can trust in Him. Thus, Paul gave us a lot of imperatives. We need to take these imperatives by trusting in the Lord. Do not take the vital groups as a movement. Just go to the Lord. Get yourself vitalized. Then go to produce a vital group, not form one.<p>Verse 14 of Ephesians 5 is an imperative-&#8220;Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead.&#8221; We should take heed to this word. There is not any doctrine here. We must wake up. If we do not, we are through. We say that we hate the deadness of Sardis, but we have to arise from the dead. Awake and arise! I feel this verse is very practical to us. If we awake and arise, Christ will shine on us. His shining will work out many things and show us where we are. He will shine on us to expose us. If we do not arise, Christ&#8217;s shining is not with us. His shining is waiting for our arising. We need to be vitalized because we are sleeping. We need to be saved from our deadness.<p>Do not trust in others to help you in this matter. You have to pray. You have to put your trust in the Lord. Only the Lord is the source. Only He can shine on you. Only He can bring you into the light to cause you to be fully exposed. Only He can render a real repentance and confession to you. The vital groups should be started by your going to the Lord. This is the sowing of the seed, and something will grow out of this.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>HAVING A LITTLE POWER AND HAVING CONSTANT CONTACTS WITH PEOPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rev. 3:7-8</h1><h2 class=head1>&#8220;YOU HAVE A LITTLE POWER&#8221;</h2><p>Recently I have been wondering before the Lord why our start with the vital groups seems to be so slow. Most of us love the Lord and are seeking after Him in this age. As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He reminded me of Revelation 3:7-8. These verses say, &#8220;And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens: I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.&#8221;<p>I want to stress this short phrase-you have a little power. Those in Philadelphia did not have much power. They just had a little power. This word was given to the best church among the seven churches-the church in Philadelphia, the church of brotherly love. The Lord first recommended Himself to them by telling them who He is-He is the Holy One and the true One who has the key of David and who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one will open. Surely He has a lot of power. Then Revelation 3 shows us the best church, the top church throughout the centuries. According to our concept, such a top church must be powerful, omnipotent. But how much power did this top church have? Only a little power. The Lord, on the other hand, is the One who has the key of David. He is powerful and full of authority. Yet the best church among His churches has only a little power. We should not expect that we will be greatly powerful. This realization enlightened me. I realized that we have only a little power, not much power.<p>The Lord impressed me that He is the One who has the key of David, being full of authority. He is the One who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one will open. But He did not demand that much of the best church. We would expect the top church, the church in Philadelphia, to have much power, but this is not the case.<p>We may also consider that our progress should be fast. But consider Jacob when he came back from Padanaram to the good land with his big family. It is recorded that when Jacob led his wives and children and the livestock to meet his brother, he knew that he could not journey too fast. His progress in his journeying was very slow (Gen. 31:18; 33:14). We should not expect that we can go that fast. Surely I dare not say that I am fast, so I am very sympathetic with all of us. The Lord appreciated the church in Philadelphia and opened the door which no one could shut, because they had a little power, kept the Lord&#8217;s word, and did not deny His name. This comforted me. Most of us really love the Lord and seek after Him. But I cannot say that we are powerful. All of us have only a little power.<h2 class=head1>THE START OF THE VITAL GROUPS BEING A MATTER OF DEGREE</h2><p>Recently some have asked me whether or not they have had a start in the vital groups. We need to realize that our start in the vital groups is a matter of degree. Someone who is learning the English language begins by learning the ABCs. Surely he has started to learn the English language. But another one who is more proficient in English may be starting to learn at a higher stage and level. His start is to a higher degree. The learning of mathematics is another illustration of this. Math is taught in elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. We cannot say that someone who is learning math in elementary school has not started yet. On the other hand, even someone who is working on his Ph.D. in math is still being taught.<p>I do believe that many of us have had a start in the vital groups to varying degrees. In recent church meetings on the Lord&#8217;s Day morning, we have seen signs of the start of the vital groups. There are signs of some increase. If the vital groups had never been started at all, not even in an &#8220;ABC&#8221; way, we could not have had such good meetings with such promising signs.<p>Even though we may be happy to a certain extent, we still are not satisfied. If I intended to learn English and had only learned the ABCs, I would have had a start, but I would still not be satisfied with that. I would want to learn more and improve until I mastered the English language. It is the same with the learning of math. When a student learns addition and subtraction, he has started to learn mathematics, but he needs to go on in his learning.<p>Many of us have been faithful to the Lord. We love Him and are seeking after Him. We need to accept what we have and where we are at the present time and aspire to go on with the Lord step by step. The church in Philadelphia was the top one, but it had only a little power. They did their best for the Lord with what they had. This indicates that what pleases the Lord is not our doing much for Him but our doing our best for Him with what we have. We have only a little power and we have done something. We have started, but we should not be contented or satisfied with what we have started.<p>We should be comforted. The signs showing that we have started are already among us. Our trouble is our analyzing mind. When what we do is not according to what we expect, we begin to doubt about whether we have something real or genuine. We analyze and then we check with others concerning the genuineness of what we are practicing and what we have experienced. We may ask someone, &#8220;Do you think I have started?&#8221; Then the one whom we are asking may respond, &#8220;Do you believe I have started?&#8221; Then the next question may be, &#8220;Who among us has started in full?&#8221; But to what extent do we mean when we say &#8220;in full&#8221;? Who is vital one hundred percent &#8220;in full&#8221;? Maybe only the apostle Paul was such a one. I am sharing this to show that we cannot deny that the Lord has been going on among us. In the past year, the Lord has really done something in Southern California. When we look back at our situation from the proper angle, we have to kneel down to praise Him: &#8220;Lord, I am still so weak, so down, yet I cannot deny that You have done something.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>SOME POINTS TO HELP US GO ON WITH THE LORD</h2><p>I would like us to take note of a few points to help us go on with the Lord:<p>1. We all have had some start.<p>2. We need to improve, to grow, to mature.<p>3. We are used to analyzing, to lingering, and to doubting about what we have experienced, and we would not forget about what we have experienced and be brought on to maturity, to perfection.<p>We need to realize, however, that we are not worthy of being analyzed. We have to say, &#8220;Thank You, Lord, that You have afforded me to learn the &#8216;ABCs.&#8217;&#8221; This is better than nothing. Yet we also have to say, &#8220;Lord, grant me further favor that I could learn more.&#8221; Maybe we have the feeling that we have not started so well. This kind of feeling, on the one hand, urges us to go on. Yet on the other hand, it is also a kind of hindrance, because we do not have the assurance that we have started. We may say, &#8220;I have repented, but now I feel my repentance is not that thorough. I have made confession, but it was not a thorough confession.&#8221; But how thorough is it to be thorough? Again, this is a matter of degree. I believe that a number of us have had times to repent and confess. But you may have gone to the Lord again to say, &#8220;Lord, have mercy upon me. I don&#8217;t think my repentance and my confession are thorough. I want to repent and confess again.&#8221; We have to be careful about this because we may be going back to lay a foundation of repentance after we have already laid this foundation (Heb. 6:1, 4a, 6). The more we do this, the more we lose our confidence and assurance.<p>Satan is subtle, and our self is also hard to deal with. No one among us can have a thorough, &#8220;one hundred percent,&#8221; start. No one among us can have a repentance with a confession that is thorough to the uttermost. So we should not be disappointed, nor should we be contented. We can pray, &#8220;Lord, thank You. Since I heard the messages on the vital groups, I have started, Lord, by Your mercy, to repent and confess. Yet dear Lord, You know that my repentance needs to be improved, my confession needs to grow, and my whole practice in the vital groups needs to mature. I look to You to take me on.&#8221;<p>I want to say again that the Lord is the One full of authority, full of power. He has the key, the power, to open the door that no one can shut, and He has the power to shut the door that no one can open. Yet He was so clear about the situation of His best church. Even His best church had only a little power. The Lord was satisfied with this. The Lord did not expect that this top church could have great power-just a little power. But why was the Lord so appreciative of this church? Because she had a little power and also kept His word and did not deny His name. We do have a little power, and we can pray, &#8220;Lord, thank You for Your mercy. We have started. Yet Lord, we still need more mercy. Have more and more mercy upon us that we could go on, that we could grow, that we could improve, and that we could mature.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO HAVE CONSTANT CONTACTS</h2><p>I feel in these days that we must stress one thing: to contact people. As one who is practicing to be vital, you have to contact people-either the saints or the sinners. You have to contact people-either your direct, close relatives or your distant friends. Just contact people. If you are led to go out to knock on &#8220;cold doors,&#8221; that is all right. You do not necessarily need to wait until you are finished contacting all your relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues. It all depends upon how you feel. If you feel that now you should go out to knock on cold doors, that might be the leading of the Lord to you.<p>But I also want to mention another thing as a warning. In spiritual matters, we naturally like to choose to do the easy thing. We do not like to do the hard thing. We like to preach the gospel in an easy way with instant results. We may want to pass out some tracts at a bank or a supermarket. Someone who does this may be very fortunate to meet a man who gets baptized the next day, and eventually his whole family comes into the church life. However, such a fortunate thing does not take place often. You may go to the bank for ten weeks and gain no one. You may go to the supermarket for twelve weeks and gain no one. To labor in the gospel you need to exercise your endurance.<p>The point I am stressing is this: do not get a new one quickly baptized and think you have finished your job. You should not say, &#8220;Hallelujah, I have gained some fruit,&#8221; and think that is all you need to do. Yes, you may have gained some fruit, but be sure that this fruit will never remain. This is not the proper way to contact someone. The proper way to contact a person is to make him a constant contact of yours. Whoever you gain should be kept by you as your constant contact. Even if someone has not yet been begotten by you in the Lord, you have to contact him as your child. It may be that he will be begotten by you next week or even next year, so you have to keep him as your constant contact.<p>You should try your best to always keep four or five new ones under your care. If you do have four or five, you do not need to be in that much of a hurry to contact others. If one of them moves, try to replace him with someone else. Always try to keep four or five under your hand. Maybe after two weeks, two of these five will be baptized. But do not stop caring for them. Baptism is not a graduation. Rather, baptism is an entry into the Christian life. Thus, you should still count these two baptized ones as your constant contacts. Right away you have to change your way to contact them. You have to feed them. Feeding needs more patience and more labor. You should have the attitude that you do not want to see any of your children die prematurely. You must endeavor to keep them alive by taking care of them day by day. First you have to feed them. Maybe after three months, you can begin to raise them up, to teach them, to train them, to perfect them. You need to spend a lot of time to do this.<p>Then if the dear ones who are under your hand have really been progressive, passing through the feeding period and the perfecting period, they are ready for you to bring them on, to help them learn how to study the Word and to prophesy for the Lord. This is not easy, so you may have to spend three more years just to train your new children to prophesy. Try to teach them how to compose a prophecy and how to speak it.<p>You may think that after someone has learned how to prophesy, he will graduate. But I have learned that none under our care really graduate. The more you take care of certain ones, the more you feel you need to help them. For many years, I have taught many people. To my consideration, not one of them has ever graduated. I still need to perfect them. I even expect some of the brothers under my care to eventually be better than I am spiritually. We may wonder if we have to take care of certain ones until we are in the New Jerusalem. This means that we have become tired. We need to exercise our endurance and still spend time to raise up those whom the Lord has given us to care for. We must learn the lesson to keep constant contact with people. Then for the long run we all will see the rich fruitfulness.<p>Do not do a work in which you are expecting to be fortunate. Do not think in this way. Instead, think in the way of having something constant. You have to pray and look to the Lord all the time to give you some proper constant contacts. Do not think that since you have baptized someone quickly, you are doing all right. If you practice in this way, you will have fruit which does not remain. Whether the fruit under your hand will remain or not depends upon how you take care of people, from begetting them to feeding them, to perfecting them, and then to building them up to speak for the Lord. That means this one is a full-grown man. Until one reaches the stage where he can speak for the Lord, he is not full-grown yet. To prophesy in the meeting is a sign of full-grown status. Beginning from this day, I hope we all will have a resolution in the depths of our heart to contact people through prayer, with prayer, and in prayer and to make each one of our contacts a constant one.<p>We also need to learn how to redeem our time. Satan, the evil one, who is working busily in the air, never wants us to pray. Satan will do everything to waste away your time for prayer. So you have to redeem your time to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17).<p>Also, learn to pray directly. Do not teach the Lord and do not explain to Him in your prayer. The blind man who contacted the Lord outside of the city of Jericho cried out, &#8220;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221; (Luke 18:38). The Lord then said, &#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221; (v. 41). This blind man did not pray in the natural way that we do. He did not give the Lord a lot of explanations, a lot of instructions, and a lot of teachings. Instead, he simply said, &#8220;Lord, that I may receive my sight!&#8221; (v. 41). In our prayer we give too many explanations and too many teachings. It seems that the Lord knows nothing, so we have to teach Him. We have to tell Him who He is and what He can do. This is a routine prayer. We should just tell the Lord what we need and what we want. If we want the Lord to stir up the saints, we should simply pray, &#8220;Lord, stir up the saints.&#8221; This is good enough.<p>We must learn to go and contact people through prayer, in prayer, and with prayer all the time. We can give them a phone call or send them one of our gospel tracts. We should read these tracts so that we know their contents. Then we can send a certain tract to someone based upon his need. If we know someone is not clear that the Lord is his Savior, we can send him Christ the Savior, a tract concerning Christ&#8217;s status as the Lamb of God (John 1:29), the bronze serpent (3:14-15), and the grain of wheat (12:24).<p>First Corinthians 15:58 says that our labor in Christ will never be in vain. Only the Lord knows what will be the issue of our labor. We need to labor in Him until the day we see Him at His return. We have started, and we still have to grow. We should have the assurance that the Lord has done something with us because we have been pursuing Him and seeking Him. On the one hand, we should not analyze. On the other hand, we should not be satisfied. We must go on to grow, to progress, to mature. Then we need to make a resolution to contact people every day. This is the unique duty, responsibility, and work we have to finish in our Christian life. We must produce some children, and we must have some children, four or five, under our care. The only way for us is to contact people, and the only secret of our success is to have constant contacts for our whole life.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>OUR NEED TO RISE UP AND TAKE ACTION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:58</h1><p>In this message I want to point out two verses from the Scripture for our encouragement to go on in the vital groups. First Thessalonians 1:3 speaks of the believers&#8217; work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope. Then 1 Corinthians 15:58 charges us to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO TAKE ACTION</h2><p>I believe many of us have been qualified to take action, to work for the Lord. Thus far, we have stressed that we need the proper preparation. We need to repent, to confess, and to have intimate fellowship with the Lord and with our companions. As long as we have entered into these things, we are qualified and ready to take action. Our entering into these things is a matter of degree. In this age and in this flesh, we can never be perfect in anything. But we have to learn that after we seek the Lord for some time by contacting Him, repenting to Him, confessing our shortcomings to Him, and abiding in the fellowship with Him and with His children, we are ready to take action.<h2 class=head1>DOING A WORK OF FAITH</h2><p>We have to learn to take action, to work, to labor, in faith, not by our feelings. When we make a resolution to visit people, we may begin to feel down. This is a common thing. We should still labor regardless of our feelings. First Thessalonians says that our work must be of faith. Faith means not doing anything in yourself, not doing anything by yourself, and not doing anything according to your feeling. We should not be people who take action just when we are feeling very good and very high. We need to take action in faith regardless of how we feel.<p>When you take action and are busy, the enemy is also busy. If you are sleeping, he will not come to visit you. But when you are active, be aware: Satan will be more active. Some say that Satan is walking to and fro to seek the weaker ones. That concept is not so accurate. He is not fighting with the weaker ones. He is mainly fighting with the stronger ones, with the ones who have decided to rise up. So when you are up, the enemy is also up.<p>Many times the environment becomes difficult when we are endeavoring to do something for the Lord. We may say that if the Lord wills, He surely will prepare everything and make everything so convenient for us. Sometimes this may be the case, but many times it is not. Consider Paul&#8217;s journeys. He was not prosperous, outwardly speaking. There were troubles, frustrations, opposition, and attacks following him wherever he went. Was he in the Lord&#8217;s will, or was he taking action by himself? Surely Paul was in the Lord&#8217;s will. When he took action in the Lord, Satan also took action to frustrate him. We should learn that when we wake up and rise up to labor in the Lord, Satan will try to frustrate us, so we should not trust in our feelings. To labor in faith means that our work is altogether not of us or by us but by another One, by the One whom we love, whom we seek, and who sent us. We simply need to go and act on His word. He tells us clearly to go and disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19a). We should say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I go not on my feeling but on Your word.&#8221;<p>Abraham is an example of one who acted by faith on the Lord&#8217;s word. He was called and sent by the Lord to Canaan, but the Lord did not tell him exactly where He wanted him to go. But Abraham still took action according to the Lord&#8217;s word. Hebrews 11:8 says, &#8220;By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.&#8221; When Abraham went out, he did not even know where to go. This afforded him constant opportunity to exercise his faith to trust in God for His instant leading, taking God&#8217;s presence as the map for his traveling. Some think that if anything is of the Lord, the Lord will let us know and tell us clearly in advance what we should do and where we should go. Actually, this is not the case. He will not tell you beforehand by giving you a driving map. Instead, the Lord Himself is the map. Abraham walked in this way by following the Lord instantly step by step.<p>Some may think that when they become a servant of the Lord, everything will be wonderful. But it is not that wonderful. In this world and in this age, there are no wonderful things. The only wonderful thing is the Lord Himself. He is wonderful. As long as you go with Him and have Him, that is wonderful. We need to forget about ourselves, about our feelings, and even about our considerations of who we are. Some of us may think we are &#8220;small potatoes&#8221; who do not have a big gift or a big function. We may feel that it is better not to take action, that it is better to go back to sleep and rest. But this fits in with Satan&#8217;s desire. We have to rise up and take action.<p>You may say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whom the Lord wants me to contact; I prayed about some people, but it seems not one is ready for me to contact.&#8221; Eventually, the Lord will say, &#8220;Just go! Go by Me, go in Me, and go with Me, not by yourself, not in yourself, and not with yourself.&#8221; If you go by yourself, that is not in faith. You are not trusting in the Lord but in yourself. We have to learn to take action in faith, believing in the Lord.<p>Sometimes you may be very excited and feel that you are in the heavens. The Lord may give you two or three good contacts who are very promising. But eventually, there may be no positive result with these ones. Often, when you contact people, when you would speak for the Lord, you will not feel so high. Rather, you may feel down. You may meet a person who does not seem promising. But later you may find out that he is a wonderful person. Through your contact with him when you felt down, you gained a very promising result. Thus, your labor and the result you gain do not depend upon your feeling.<p>I was burdened by the Lord to come to the United States. On the one hand, it was good. But on the other hand, some feelings were there which were not so encouraging. I wondered, &#8220;If I go to America, whom shall I contact and what shall I do?&#8221; There was also the question of how I would be supported financially. Today thirty-two years have passed since I came to the United States, and there has been a positive result. Forty years ago there was no arrangement among us to take care of the workers&#8217; material supply. So a worker went out empty-handed. Actually, though, when I came to the United States I was not empty-handed, because in my two hands I had the Lord. If you have everything, you do not need to exercise your faith. But if you have only the Lord, you surely need to exercise your faith. When we touch the Lord&#8217;s work, we should not do anything by our feeling. We should simply take action by faith.<p>We have been instructed and advised to repent, to confess, and to have intimate fellowship with the Lord and with our companions. Most of us have done this. But now we would hesitate, we would consider what to do, and we would wonder about whom we should contact. Dear saints, I would say this: &#8220;Go like Abraham, not knowing where to go.&#8221; You are ready. You are qualified. Just go to contact people. I can testify that eventually the Lord will send people to you.<p>Recently about seventeen districts on this globe have contacted me by either writing me or calling me. These districts are Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Western Europe, Russia, Poland, Africa, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico and the islands in the Caribbean Sea, and the United States. This shows how the Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread within the thirty-two years I have been in the United States. When the Lord&#8217;s recovery was brought into the English language, it spread to all the continents. Thirty-two years ago I never thought that such a thing would happen. But if I had stayed in Taiwan and would not have taken action, what would have happened? If all of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery would rise up to take action, the world would be turned upside down (cf. Acts 17:6-KJV). We are so limited, but He is not limited. We are not serving ourselves. We are surely not worthy of being served. We are serving Him. We made a great resolution with Him for His sake, not for our sake. We are taking the way of the vital groups not for ourselves, but for His sake, for Him.<p>Since you have repented, you have confessed, you have fellowshipped and still remain in the fellowship, you are qualified to go. You should simply take action by faith. Dear saints, today your action means a lot. If you are still hesitating, still lingering, still considering, still feeling that you are not qualified, you are wrong. Just take action. We have shared previously how the Lord honored D. L. Moody&#8217;s vow to preach the gospel to at least one person each day. He did this regardless of his feeling, and the Lord saved people through him.<h2 class=head1>NOT TRUSTING IN OURSELVES</h2><p>The only thing is this: when you take action, you should not do anything by trusting in yourself. Always hold the following prayerful attitude: &#8220;Lord, regardless of how much I&#8217;ve been working for You, without You I am nothing. I don&#8217;t depend upon anything from the human side. I only trust in You.&#8221; In 1963 I started to visit a group of saints in Las Vegas. Eventually, they made the decision to sell their hall and move to Los Angeles to meet with the church there, although I never said anything to them about doing this. I simply went there to minister Christ to them. Before I came to the United States, I did not dream that such things would happen. I did not dream that the Lord&#8217;s recovery would spread from the United States to countries like Russia and Poland.<p>You should not think that I can do something in the Lord but you cannot. This is wrong. All of you can do something in the Lord. You should just take action. The result depends upon His blessing. Throughout the years this has been my loving prayer: &#8220;Lord, I trust in Your mercy. I trust in Your blessing. I trust in Your presence. I trust in Your word. I trust in Your Spirit. I don&#8217;t have any trust at all in myself, in anything else, or in anyone else.&#8221; We all need to pray such a prayer. Many of us have received much equipping in the years that we have been in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. If we remain simple and single toward the Lord and take action in Him, He can work through us. If I would not have taken action to come to the United States thirty-two years ago, that would have been a great loss. I am saying this to encourage us all to take action.<h2 class=head1>CONTACTING PEOPLE AND SOWING THE SEED OF CHRIST INTO THEM</h2><p>When we take action, we should not forget that the main thing is to contact people. We must have an interest in people. We must love people and like to talk to people. Whether or not you know how to talk does not matter. You had better speak something you do not know. Sometimes I did this as a young person. People thought I knew a lot, but actually I did not know that much. But when we speak, the Lord has a way to speak through us. Do not forget that you do not need to talk too much. Just say a few sentences concerning Christ. You must sow the seed of Christ through your contact. This seed will grow. Now is the time for you all to take action. The more that you do, the more you will learn. What I have received through the years was mostly gained by doing and learning.<h2 class=head1>A WORD TO THE ELDERS</h2><p>I would like to say a word to the elders concerning the going on of the vital groups. The elders should be those who shepherd the flock. They may be one hundred percent for the vital groups and yet not charge the flock. I am concerned that they may not contact the individual sheep to find out how they are doing in the vital groups. The elders must do something to raise up the saints. They are not only the shepherds but also the &#8220;head sheep&#8221; at the head of the flock. If the head sheep would not take action, the whole flock will be stopped. The elders do not need to rebuke others. They just need to take care of the sheep. Every week they should contact a few saints for fellowship. Such fellowship will stir up the saints to go on.<p>The elders should take some action to supervise, but they may not like to oversee others to find out the real situation. Some of them may be afraid to do this for fear that the saints will be offended. But I assure you that most of the saints want the elders to visit them. Most of the saints love the elders and want to see them and fellowship with them. A certain saint may not like the elders, but the elders should still try to visit him. After two years, he may tell a particular elder, &#8220;Probably you don&#8217;t know how much help you rendered to me. Without your coming to visit me two years ago, I would not be here. I might be out of the church life.&#8221;<p>We should not do things according to our culture or constitution. We should do things according to the need of the Lord. The Lord needs a flock; the Lord needs the elders to shepherd the flock. Of course, I noticed that many of the elders are very careful not to offend the saints or make them unhappy. This is good. But if the parents are always so good to the children and do not correct them, the children will be spoiled. I am saying this to point out that eventually the perfected saints will be grateful to the elders who care for them properly.<p>I am burdened for both the elders and the rest of the saints. The saints may think, &#8220;We are small; we have only one talent. What can we do? Even if we do something, there will probably be no result, so it is better not to do it. It is better to wait.&#8221; Then the elders may think, &#8220;We need to be careful not to touch the saints too much. If we touch them too much, we will interfere with them, bother them, offend them, and lose them.&#8221; Thus, the elders do not feel free, because they have been bound by the saints.<p>I am burdened that all the saints would rise up to take action. I am also burdened to see the elders rise up to supervise and shepherd the flock in order to help them go on in the way of the vital groups. If all of us rise up to contact people every day, the Lord will really have a way to gain something. Just contact one or two people each day. If you do not know how to speak, just speak. If you speak, you will learn how to speak. This training should usher in your action. There is no reason or excuse that you would not take action to contact people.<h2 class=head1>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN A SPIRIT OF PRAYER WITH ENDURANCE</h2><p>Always contact people in a spirit of prayer. I realize that we all are busy and do not have that much time. You may not have much opportunity to separate time to pray to the Lord. Of course, if you can do this, it is much better. But even while you are driving to work, you can pray, &#8220;Lord, I don&#8217;t know whom I should contact today. Give me one or two to contact.&#8221; Then you can contact people in a spirit of prayer.<p>Whenever you contact people, always grasp the opportunity to say something concerning Christ, to sow a seed of Christ into them. Such a sowing word can never be forgotten. People may not respond right now, but eventually they will respond. They may even respond at the end of their life, showing that the seed of Christ sown into people is never in vain. This is why Paul told us in 1 Corinthians 15:58 to &#8220;be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.&#8221; To abound is to increase and to multiply. In order to labor we need endurance. So in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul indicated that we need to work, to labor, with endurance. This is because whatever we do in the Lord will not be in vain. If He would give us the result right now, that is good. But if not, we still have the faith that whatever we do in Him and for Him will not be in vain.<h2 class=head1>THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>In order to live a normal Christian life, three things are very much needed: 1) seeking after the Lord; 2) coming to the meetings; and 3) going to contact people. If you want to be a normal Christian, just do these three things. First, we should seek after the Lord for His life. We should desire to experience Him, to grow in Him, to live Him, and to express Him. Paul said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). He lives in me, so I live Him. Then we need to come to the weekly meetings of the church and go to contact people. Our meaning for being on this earth is not just to make a living for our existence. Our living on this earth is for the Lord, so that we can contact people and so that He can gain people through us. Every year we should endeavor to gain someone for the Lord. This is the real meaning of life for us Christians.<p>In our speaking to people, we should always remember to sow the seed of Christ. Say something from the Bible and sow the word into your contacts. This seed will remain in them, and our work will never be in vain. Also, when we go to visit people, we should bring the gospel tracts we have prepared and distribute them. Something through these pages will be sown into our contacts and also into their friends and family members. Someone to whom you give a tract may leave it on his coffee table, and the other members of his family may read it. This is the sowing of the seed of the gospel.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>ABIDING IN THE LORD AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT TO FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:5; 7:38-39; Rom. 8:4b; Acts 4:31; 1 Thes. 5:17-19</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Abiding in the Lord-John 15:5.</li><li>Walking according to the spirit (or, the Spirit)-Rom. 8:4b.</li><li>To flow rivers of living water-John 7:38-39.</li><li>By the fullness of the Spirit-Acts 4:31.</li><li>Not quenching the Spirit by praying unceasingly and giving thanks in everything-1 Thes. 5:17-19.</li></ol><p>Hymns, #770:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace,<br>Grace as a river shall flow;<br>In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace,<br>Grace as a river shall flow.	<ol class="none">	<li>Hallelujah!

Thank You.</p><h2 class=head1>ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2><p>In John 15 the Lord Jesus unveiled God&#8217;s economy in this universe in a very simple way, in the way of a parable concerning the vine tree, the true vine. Yet the revelation here is not that simple. In this message my burden is to show us that in this parable the Lord points out what our status is. To be a Christian, a believer in Christ, and to be a follower of Christ, what kind of persons should we be? The Lord says that our status in Him is to be a branch of Him, a part of Him to branch Him out (v. 5).<p>We were created by God in Adam, and eventually we were born in Adam. That was our status. But God transferred us out of Adam and put us into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Our being in Christ is a union in life, making us one with Christ in life and in nature. He is the tree and we are the branches. There is no difference in anything between the tree and the branches, because they are one entity. The only distinction between Him and us is this: He needs us to branch Him out, and we need Him to be our supply and to be our everything.<p>Here we can see our function and our commission on this earth. A branch of a vine tree is there for nothing else except to bear fruit. Bearing fruit is an issue of the flow of life. In order to bear fruit, we must abide in Christ. In John 15:5 the Lord said, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221; In order to bear fruit, we must abide in Him, remain in the union of life in Him, keep ourselves always one with Him, and never be separated from Him. If we are apart from Him, we have lost our status, we have annulled our function, and we can do nothing.<p>Look at today&#8217;s millions of Christians. Who is functioning to branch Christ out, to issue forth Christ in fruit-bearing? In Christianity we see the clerical class, the educated, trained, and disciplined ministers and preachers. What are they doing? Many of them are doing a work, but they are not doing a living work. They are not living a life as the branches of the vine tree. Then the majority of the so-called laity have become useless, having their functions annulled. Where can we see the picture that is portrayed, depicted, in this parable in John 15? It is hard to see such a picture on the earth today.<p>We also need to consider the situation among us in the light of John 15. We love Christ, we seek after Him, and we pursue Him. But we have to admit and confess that we do not live a life like a branch of the vine tree-to abide in Him all the time that we may flow Him out, branch Him out, to have an issue in bearing fruit. I want to make one thing clear: the vital groups are just normal believers living a life as the real branches of the great vine tree in this universe. We are not just preaching the gospel to win souls for an increase in our number.<p>What we expect to see is that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery all the dear saints who love the Lord, who are pursuing after Him, would see their status as the members of the living Christ. These members of the living Christ are the branches of the vine tree. We are branches of the vine tree to bear fruit, to flow Him out, to branch Him out. This is our function. This is our commission. This can take place only by our constant abiding in the vine.<h2 class=head1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Romans 8:4b shows that normal Christians should walk according to the spirit. This spirit can be spelled with either a small s or a capital S. This is because the human spirit and the divine Spirit are mingled as one spirit. There is a person today in this universe, even on this earth, who is called the Spirit, and we are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The normal Christians, the vital group people, should be those who live, act, walk, and have their being according to the spirit. In other words, they would not do anything that is not according to the spirit. Even good things and things that are according to the highest standard of morality they would not do, unless they do them according to the spirit.<p>A person who does things only according to the mingled spirit is a normal Christian, and he surely is a member of the vital groups. Such a person surely is a functioning branch of the vine tree. This kind of person always sets his mind upon the spirit (Rom. 8:6). Of course, he also knows how to keep himself away from the flesh, from the self, from the fallen humanity, in order to be one with the Spirit in everything.<h2 class=head1>TO FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h2><p>Our walking according to the spirit will spontaneously have an issue, and that issue is to flow out Christ to bear fruit, and to bear fruit is to transmit Christ into others. According to the revelation given to us in the New Testament, a person who abides in Christ, who walks according to the spirit, always flows by speaking. If there is no speaking, there is no flowing. Our flowing is to speak. If from the first day of the year to the last day of the year you never speak to anybody concerning Christ, you do not flow Him. Regardless of how much you feel you are enjoying Christ, participating in His riches, the flow of life within you has been stopped.<p>To flow is to speak. The Lord said in John 7:38, &#8220;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; When a branch is full of life, spontaneously that life will flow out. When we are filled with the Spirit, we are full of Christ, and our uttering organ will be open to speak forth Christ. When I was young, I spoke even when people were not around. When you are so full, you have to flow out, to speak. Now we have seen the status of the vital group, the commission of the vital group, and the function of the vital group.<p>We may have the impression that we merely want to see an increase in number. I have said that we should try to gain one person a year and that we should always keep four or five under our care. Some who have criticized me said that I changed. They said I used to speak about life, but now all I speak is statistics, budgets, and numbers. That is their misunderstanding. I do not mean that. Whether or not we bring someone to the Lord is not the problem. The problem is that we do not live a normal Christian life, a life of abiding in the Lord all the time, living, walking, and having our being according to the spirit in everything. If we are such persons, we will speak Christ all the time. We will speak God&#8217;s salvation and speak God as grace. We should forget about whether or not there will be some fruit. I assure you that there will be some fruit. The fruit will be the issue of our flowing.<h2 class=head1>BY THE FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT AND NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT BY PRAYING UNCEASINGLY AND GIVING THANKS IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>Acts 4:31 says that when the disciples prayed, &#8220;the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.&#8221; At that time the disciples were a group of Galileans living in Jerusalem under the threatening of the persecuting Jewish religionists, yet they did not care for anything except the Lord. They only loved the Lord. They were pursuing after Him. They did not know anything else but Christ the Son of God. All day long, they prayed unceasingly. They gave thanks to God in everything and were happy and rejoicing. Thus, they did not quench the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:17-19). Rather, they fanned their spirit into flame (2 Tim. 1:6-7). They were such persons. They were filled with the Spirit, not only inwardly but also outwardly. They had the fullness of the Spirit. A cup which is half full of water does not have the fullness of water. If water is poured into it to make it full, the water will flow out of it. Those dear saints in Acts 4:31 were full of Christ, so they were bubbling. They spoke the word of God with power.<p>What I am sharing here is the main extract of my messages for these past two years. Do not forget that to be a believer in Christ is to be a part of Christ, a member of Christ, a branch of Christ. You are a branch of the vine tree. A branch of a tree is just a part of the tree. What do we as the parts of Christ need to do? We need to abide in Him as the tree, to be one with Him in the union of life, to live, to act, and to have our being in everything according to the spirit. We need to pray all the time, thanking God for everything all the time. Then we will have the fullness of the Spirit and we will flow Christ by speaking.<p>Dear saints, this is a vital group. This is what I have seen of the Lord. This is what I expect to see-that all you dear ones who are in the recovery would be this kind of persons. We are going to gain people not by rock music or by some other impure method. We are going to gain people by purely speaking Christ, speaking grace, speaking God, to everyone. In a certain sense, we should not care whether or not someone understands us or apprehends what we are saying. We should just care for speaking, for flowing rivers of living water all the time.<p>Each one of us should be bubbling with the Lord by speaking. If we are not like this, we are a flat tire. We are not full, because we do not pray. We do not pray, because we are apart from Christ. We do not flow, because we do not have our life according to the spirit. We need to be addicted to Christ. We need to abide in Christ, keeping ourselves in the life union, the organic union, in Christ. We need to walk, live, and have our being according to the spirit. Then we will speak Christ every day and everywhere. This is what we want to see. This is a vital group of Christians.<p>We are Christians, and we must realize that a real Christian is a branch of Christ. Our status is that of a branch. As branches of Christ, we live by walking according to the spirit. Then spontaneously we flow by speaking. All the dear saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should be like this. I have given many messages on the new way, the God-ordained way, and the vital groups. I have been asked many questions about how to do things and how to carry them out. We should not be so complicated. We should make everything simple.<p>You are a branch of Christ, the great vine, and this is your status. You should abide in Him to flow Him out, to branch Him out, to bear fruit by flowing the river of grace, by speaking. If no person is around, we can even speak to the angels. We can tell the angels that they are our servants and that we are the heirs of so great a salvation (Heb. 1:14; 2:3a). If no person is around us, we can even speak to the furniture in our room. Some may think that this is crazy, but actually this is the exercise of our spirit of sobermindedness (2 Tim. 1:7). It is normal for us to flow rivers of living water all the time.<p>We should forget all of our questions. We should simply realize that we are branches of the vine tree. No matter what your earthly profession is, you are really just a branch, a part, of Christ to branch Him out, to live Him, to express Him, and to impart Him to others. Stay with Him, abide in Him, to live in the organic union with Him. Then spontaneously you will do everything according to the spirit. You will be a person praying, thanking, and rejoicing all the time. You will never quench the Spirit, but you will always fan the spirit into flame. Then you will be so full of Christ that you have to overflow with Christ by speaking.<p>To speak is the only way to flow. We should care only for this. Then there is no problem. The only problem is that we forsake our status. We do not want to be branches. We want to be something more. People used to ask me, &#8220;How can I be spiritual?&#8221; We should not be bothered and complicated with such questions. Instead, we should just be the branches of Christ. This is so simple.<p>I have been speaking for a number of years concerning the God-ordained way with its four steps: 1) begetting; 2) nourishing; 3) teaching; and 4) prophesying. We may have adopted all of these terms, but we may also have become complicated and even confused. I have a burden to tell you not to be confused and not to be complicated. Just be simple. Just realize that you are a branch of Christ, abiding in Him, walking, living, and having your being according to the spirit. Surely you will be a praising person; you will be a thanking person, a person thanking God all the time; and you will be a person praying and rejoicing. Then you will have the fullness of the Spirit. You will pour out by speaking to others. Do not care about whether they will be saved or not. Only the Lord knows. You just carry out your commission. Your function is to bear the fruit, and to bear the fruit is not just a kind of doing, but a kind of living. We all should say, &#8220;I am just a branch abiding in Christ and walking according to the spirit to flow Christ as rivers of living water.&#8221;<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE LABOR OF LOVE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:3; Col. 1:28-29; 2:1; 1 Cor. 3:8; 15:10, 58</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The vital group should press on according to the apostle Paul&#8217;s prayer in 1 Thessalonians 1:3:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Concerning the work of faith.</li>	<li>Concerning the labor of love.</li>	<li>Concerning the endurance of hope.</li>	</ol></li><li>The work of faith:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Faith in God and in His power.</li>	<li>Faith in God&#8217;s Spirit and in His word.</li>	<li>Not in our ability, method, nor in anything else.</li>	<li>The work of faith is the foundation of our Christian service.</li>	</ol></li><li>The labor of love:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The intrinsic motivation of our work of faith.</li>	<li>The inner life of our work of faith.</li>	<li>The real strength of our work of faith.</li>	<li>The key of the fruitfulness of our work of faith.</li>	</ol></li><li>The endurance of hope:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Hope in the coming Christ with His glory.</li>	<li>Hope in the reward of the coming kingdom.</li>	<li>The endurance of hope is the long life of our work of faith:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Subduing all kinds of disappointments, discouragements, and impossibilities.</li>		<li>Overcoming all kinds of oppositions, obstacles, and frustrations.</li>		<li>Consummating in gaining sinners, feeding the believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church-the Body of Christ-for the kingdom of God and of Christ.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Thank You, Lord, that You are altogether what we need. Lord, we need You. Tonight, at this moment, we need You to cleanse us with Your precious blood. Lord, we need You as the Spirit, and we need You as the word. Come to visit us as the word and as the Spirit. While we are speaking about our serving You in any way, be with us. Be one spirit with us that we may be one spirit with You. Grant us new utterance, new light, new enlightenment, and even new encouragement with new strengthening. Lord, we say again, cover us with Your prevailing blood. Amen.<p>My burden in this message is just one word: labor. In 1 Thessalonians 1:3 the apostle Paul wrote, &#8220;Remembering unceasingly your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.&#8221; Here the apostle remembered the Thessalonians first in their work of faith, then in their labor of love, and finally in their endurance of hope.<p>There is a difference between work and labor. Paul used the word work first, mentioning the Thessalonian believers&#8217; work of faith; then he used the word labor, referring to their labor of love. Nothing exhausts us as much as being vital. If we desire to be vital, we must prepare ourselves to be exhausted. It is not adequate to be vital for just one day. To be vital requires us to labor. Every farmer knows that it is not enough merely to work. A farmer must labor. This is why we need endurance. To work does not require very much endurance, but to labor, we need endurance.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S LABOR AND STRUGGLE</h2><p>In Colossians 1:28 Paul said that he announced Christ by admonishing and teaching every man in all wisdom, that he might present every man full-grown in Christ. Then in verse 29 he said that he labored for this, struggling according to God&#8217;s operation, which operated in him in power. In the next verse, 2:1, Paul said to the Colossians, &#8220;For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, even all who have not seen my face in the flesh.&#8221; In these verses Paul said that he labored by struggling. This indicates that something was opposing and working against Paul so that he needed to struggle. The word for struggling in 1:29 can also be translated &#8220;contending,&#8221; as in wrestling. This indicates that in order to labor, we need to have a fighting, struggling spirit.<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said, &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.&#8221; To plant and to water are not merely a work but a labor. We cannot plant a seed one day and after two days expect to see it grow up. After we plant a seed, we must take care of it. After one week we may see very little growth, and after two more weeks the growth may appear to be about the same. This will exhaust us and at times even discourage us. It may cause us to think that we have planted and watered in vain. However, we need to labor by continuing to till the ground and fertilize and water the plants day by day. Paul used all these illustrations to show us what kind of work he was doing.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles. Then in verse 58 of the same chapter he advised us to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.<h2 class=head1>GAINING ONE PERSON A YEAR THROUGH LABORING</h2><p>In serving the Lord we may be very enthusiastic for one week, but after that we may become exhausted. Among us there is the need of laboring and there is the need of endurance. From the beginning, when I began to speak concerning the matter of the vital groups, I stressed the need for endurance. As long as we can get one person saved in 365 days, that is wonderful. I doubt that many of us can boast that although we have been laboring for two and a half years and have not gained anyone, we are still laboring. If this is your case, you will be blessed. You will see that in the end, you will be the most fruitful one.<p>Some saints wrote me, saying that for three weeks or three months they had practiced the God-ordained way to bear fruit and did not see any results; therefore, they said that this way does not work. However, it is impossible for a woman to become pregnant and bear a child the next day. A term of nine months is needed in order to bear one child. We should not consider it a small thing if we bring one person to the Lord within one year. That is a wonderful thing for which we should rejoice.<p>To practice the vital groups, we must be vital to the extent that we are willing to labor in any way and at any cost. This requires us to endure. If you go to visit someone consistently for half a year and nothing happens, you should keep going. If you labor much and nothing happens, will something happen if you cease your labor? Seemingly, your labor has been in vain, because for six months you have not seen any result. But for the long run, there will be a result.<h2 class=head1>THE INCREASE OF THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY IN NEW ZEALAND THROUGH THE SAINTS&#8217; LABORING</h2><p>In 1970 a certain brother came into the Lord&#8217;s recovery in New Zealand. Later, he came to Los Angeles to see me purposely. I told him that the next year, 1971, I would go to New Zealand. I went to New Zealand through Australia. I traveled from Sydney through that large island to Melbourne. At that time I did not meet anyone who had a heart for the recovery. Then I went to New Zealand to see the brother who had visited me in Los Angeles. Previously, a dear saint whom I knew and who loved my books very much had visited that island and had brought with him two of my books, The All-inclusive Christ and The Economy of God. As he was departing at the airport, he gave these two books to another man. While I was visiting New Zealand, I held a small conference there. At that time the man who had received the two books took a small plane across the island and was forced to stop in the city where I was. He heard that I was speaking there, and he came to the meeting. Through that conference he was caught by the Lord, and later his brother, who was a traveling preacher, also took the way of the recovery. This was the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s recovery in New Zealand.<p>Today, twenty-three years later, there are seven hundred New Zealanders in the recovery. In addition, three hundred Chinese saints from Taiwan recently migrated to New Zealand, making a total number of one thousand saints in New Zealand. Eventually, the Lord gave them a large piece of land, and now they have a training center with a full-time training on that land. This is the result of the saints&#8217; labor. Such a case should encourage us to labor. We do not know from where and when the fruit will come.<p>We have been rejected, opposed, defamed, and criticized. The opposing ones have tried their best to blockade us. However, in the 1993 Thanksgiving Conference in Anaheim, the attendance in the last meeting was 3,260 adults plus more than 800 children. Many of those in the meetings were new faces to me. Seemingly, we do not have much increase. Actually, that is not true. The Chinese saints who immigrated from Taiwan to New Zealand are on fire. Recently, one of the couples from there told me that, because of their being there, another church was raised up. They produced not only single believers but a church.<p>We do not know where the fruit will come from. In John 4:37-38 the Lord Jesus told us that others will sow the seed and we will reap what they have sown. At other times we may sow the seed and others may reap. According to Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 15:58, our labor in the Lord could never be in vain. If we are lazy, we should not expect the angels to send anyone to us. We need to know nothing but to labor with the full assurance that our labor will never be in vain.<h2 class=head1>LOVE BEING THE MOTIVATING POWER OF OUR LABOR</h2><p>Our labor should be a labor of love. This love indicates that we love not only the Lord but also the saints. We love the stronger ones, and we love the weaker ones. We love sinners; we love our friends; and we love our relatives, our classmates, and our colleagues. We simply love people. Love is the motivating power of our labor. Because of this love we prefer to put aside many other things and to labor. We do not know who the fruit will be and from where and when it will come. We only know to labor.<h2 class=head1>LABORING WITH A VIEW FOR THE LONG RUN</h2><p>I have been speaking for the Lord since July 1932. That was the beginning of my speaking to a church, not just to individuals. I thank the Lord that today in a number of places on this earth I can see three generations of the fruit of my labor sitting in front of me. Dear saints, we should not be shortsighted. We need to have a view for the long run. We may be concerned because, after practicing the new way for some time, it seems that thus far we have seen little fruit. However, the fruit that is quick to come in will also be quick to be absent. The most enduring fruit is the fruit that is borne slowly. If within one week we gain one as a fruit, we should know that such a fruit may not live long. However, if we spend two years to gain one, that one would never forget all the time that we spent laboring on him.<p>I was saved through a pastor&#8217;s visiting. My older sister recommended me to that pastor. Then that pastor came to visit me. Many times he spoke very little to me. He simply invited me to come to his church the next Sunday. After visiting me for a number of months, at the end of the year, in December, he told me, &#8220;Mr. Lee, I will not come again until after the new year, because you have many things to do.&#8221; He stopped coming, but on New Year&#8217;s Day, I do not know why I had a thought to go to church, but I went. From that day I never left the church. We need to labor. Our labor is altogether not a small thing. If everyone will be faithful to labor with endurance, in two years we will see the increase.<p>On the one hand, time passes quickly; on the other hand, it passes very slowly. But those who labor do not care for the passing of time. They care only for their labor. They care only to contact people. When they visit people, people always consider their visit as something excellent. They visit people not in an ordinary way but in a very special way. This does not mean that they speak a lot. Perhaps they do not speak anything concerning the Lord. They simply go and visit others. This kind of visiting will be successful. If we speak too much, that will hinder our work. We need further training on how to contact people and on how to speak and even not to speak to people.<p>We are a blessed people. Wherever we go, blessing goes with us. Whomever we visit will be visited by God&#8217;s blessing. We must believe this. Those whom we visit will never consider our visit as something ordinary. They may not say anything, but within them a deep impression will be sown into their being. Even if we do not say anything, they know what our intention is in visiting them. They know that our intention is to gain them for Christ.<h2 class=head1>LABORING TO COOPERATE WITH THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT</h2><p>Our visiting people is a preparation for the Holy Spirit to sanctify them. The Holy Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit (1 Pet. 1:2), and the first step of His sanctifying is to seek the lost sinners (Luke 15:8-10). However, in order for the Spirit to seek people, we need to visit them. If we do not visit a person, the Holy Spirit cannot seek that one. Our visiting people week after week is a reminding to them. Sooner or later the seeking Spirit will enlighten their heart. The seeking of the Spirit is in many different ways. However, one principle is certain: if no one goes to contact a person, the seeking Spirit has no &#8220;line&#8221; on which to &#8220;hook&#8221; that person. We need to throw out our line; sooner or later a fish will be on the hook.<p>When I was young I was very fervent in gospel preaching. I wrote gospel tracts and distributed them. At a certain point I became troubled by the fact that there was no fruit. Eventually, however, in my home town a church was raised up by the Lord through me. One day I baptized a person. Other Christians in my home town criticized me, saying that I was not a preacher or a pastor and I never studied in a school of theology. Nevertheless, I baptized more people than they did. Eventually, in less than ten years the attendance of the church raised up by the Lord through me might have been greater than the total attendance of all the other Christian groups in that city.<h2 class=head1>OUR LABOR IN THE LORD NOT BEING IN VAIN</h2><p>Our labor in the Lord would never be in vain and could never be in vain. We should just labor. A very deceiving tactic of the devil is to keep us from laboring for the Lord. You may make an excuse, saying that you have been working in a particular place for three years and have not gained one person. Would you not try for another three years? Eventually, if we speak to people concerning Jesus, they may not believe, but they will hear a word concerning Jesus. They could never forget that. What we have done will never be in vain.<p>I have been working in the United States for thirty-one years. Seemingly, due to the opposition from Christianity, I have not gained many people. Actually, this is not the case. The Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread to five continents through this ministry. In 1949 when I was sent out from mainland China to Taiwan, there were fewer than one hundred churches outside the mainland, mainly in Southeast Asia, in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. However, today there are at least twelve hundred churches around the globe.<p>We need to labor day and night. I do not have much time to go out to visit people. My time is spent mainly on preparing message outlines and speaking. The messages that I give are taped, transcribed, polished, and printed, and the books are sent to many places. In the past three years, six million pieces of literature, including Bibles and my books and Brother Nee&#8217;s books, have been distributed freely to more than one thousand cities in Russia. Do we think that all these have been in vain? No; these publications are still working there.<p>Although the United States is a Christian country, to my feeling the need of the American people for Christ is much greater than anywhere else. When I began to work in this country thirty-one years ago, the need was not as great as it is today. We need to go out to visit people and to give them a booklet or a tract. Whether we think they will understand it or not, we need to believe that whatever speaks about Christ will work. We do not know what word will touch people. If we give someone a tract, he may throw it on the street, but what one person throws away another may pick up and bring home. Then the members of that family, their friends, and the visitors to their home will see it. We do not know what the result will be. Sooner or later people will be touched by Christ.<p>Of course, this also depends on much prayer on our side. However, we should not feel that we must pray purposely by kneeling down for ten or twenty minutes. We can pray at any time. While we are eating we can say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, remember the sinners. Lord, remember my cousin.&#8221; We should believe that our prayer will be heard and answered.<p>I am very glad that the Lord has saved me out of the world and that I have been working for Him for more than sixty-five years. I have never regretted this. I believe that a good number of people have received the benefit of my work. We need to do our best to labor for the Lord. Otherwise, our Christian life will become meaningless. We have been saved, we have been enlightened, and we know the church and the recovery, but we need to labor. Merely to work is not sufficient. Our work will not impress people; our labor will impress them. People know by their inner feeling whether we are laboring or merely working. If we contact people as a routine, that will not impress them. We must have a heart for them. We must have a desire to gain them and to labor on them. Within them there is the realization that we are for the Lord. They could never forget that. That is effective.<p>We all need to labor in love. We need to love the Lord, love His recovery, love the church, and love the saints. We should love the stronger ones and should love the weaker ones even more. We should desire to see them and speak to them. We must be on fire. This will cause us to be very contagious. Before and after each meeting I encourage you to build up a habit of contacting people. Our contacting of people will surely be worthwhile.<h2 class=head1>OUR VISITING PEOPLE BEING A RESPONSE TO CHRIST&#8217;S TRANSCENDING</h2><p>Today our Lord is prevailing. No one in Hades, on the earth, in the air, or even in the third heaven can defeat the Lord Jesus. In His ascension the Lord Jesus transcended and surpassed Hades, the earth, the air, and also the third heaven (Heb. 4:14). The Lord needed to transcend even the third heaven because the third heaven was polluted by Satan&#8217;s presence (Job 1:6). Because Satan still has a place in the third heaven, even the third heaven needs to be under the feet of Christ. Hence, Hebrews 7:26 tells us that today Christ, our High Priest, is higher than the heavens. He is not only higher than Hades, the earth, and the air, but also higher than the heavens. He is at the peak of the universe. According to Ephesians 1:20-23, Christ&#8217;s transcendence is for Him to form the church.<p>In Ephesians 1:3-14 the threefold dispensing of the Triune God only produces the materials to constitute the church; it does not form the church. Before the transmitting of the transcending Christ in Ephesians 1:22, there were the materials, such as Peter and the one hundred twenty in Acts 1, but there was no church. On the day of Pentecost the church was formed not by the crucified Christ nor the resurrected Christ, but by the transcending Christ who passed through and surpassed the power of darkness in Hades, the opposition on earth, the rulers and authorities in the air, and even God&#8217;s abode in the third heaven. He is the One who has the power to overcome all kinds of circumstances to form the church. When He formed the church, He was the transcending One. Caesar, the high priests, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the elders were all opposing Him. Jesus did not care for these opposing ones. He is transcending. When He poured out Himself on the earth, the church was formed. Peter and the one hundred twenty became one. On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up to speak, he did not stand up by himself; he stood up with the eleven (Acts 2:14). It was not Peter who spoke; it was the church that spoke. The church had come into existence; hence, from Acts 2 the church is mentioned specifically (5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3, 4, 22; 18:22; 20:17, 28).<p>The unique transmitting of the transcending Christ is not for producing materials to constitute His Body but for forming the materials into one Body. Today we need to realize that our going out to visit people belongs to Christ&#8217;s transcending. Hades is opposing, the whole earth is opposing, and the rulers and authorities in the air are opposing. Even God&#8217;s abode in the third heaven was polluted by the presence of Satan. Christ has transcended and surpassed all these. No one can compete with Him in His transcendence. He is the One who has every kind of power. In Matthew 28:18 He said, &#8220;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&#8221; Then in verse 19 He said, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&#8221; Our going out to visit people is a response to Christ&#8217;s transcendence, in which He received all authority. This is for the forming of the church. If we do not go, the church cannot be formed.<h2 class=head1>NOT TRUSTING IN MIRACLES OR IN SPECIALLY GIFTED PERSONS</h2><p>We should not think that a vital group will do wonders. To think this way is Pentecostal. The vital group is like a fruit tree that bears fruit. It is not a miraculous thing. Year round, from spring to winter, the same tree stands there apparently the same, but every year that tree bears fruit.<p>The Lord trusts in His members, not in the spiritual &#8220;giants.&#8221; As small members in the Lord&#8217;s Body, we all are very useful to Him. Every member must work; every member must function; every member must visit others. Then we will all become vital. Do not think that by hearing a stirring message and praying for three days and three nights something miraculous will happen to us to cause us all to be vitalized. There is not such a thing. Through my study I have found out that no revival really works. But the sevenfold Spirit is now moving on this earth (Rev. 5:6). He is moving in Australia, in New Zealand, in South America, in Central America, and in North America. He is moving in many places and in many hearts. He is also moving in our hearts. If we all would realize that we do not need a great &#8220;revival&#8221; but simply need to go out to visit people, this would be much more effective than a hundred spiritual giants.<p>We should not trust in specially gifted persons. We should not consider them more capable than we are. In reality, we may be much greater than they are. We need to receive mercy from the Lord to labor. According to my experience, if I do not labor, I cannot be healthy. When I labor, all the illnesses become afraid of me. However, when I cease to labor, illness may come. We should not welcome sickness. Rather, we should love people. Every day we need to be beside ourselves, doing things that other people would consider foolish. Every day we need to contact people and speak to people about Christ.<p>If you are such a person, surely you will have companions. The Lord will give you companions. Furthermore, your endeavoring will be very contagious. Some people will be attracted by what you are. Then they will come to you. Spontaneously you will have a group, and that group will be your vital group.<p>We need to take the apostle&#8217;s word in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 concerning the labor of love, and his word in Colossians 1:28-2:1 concerning his laboring by struggling to gain every man, to admonish every man, to teach every man, and to present every man full-grown in Christ. If Paul can do this, we also can do it. We should not say that we cannot do it. We can do it.<h2 class=head1>THE ENDURANCE OF HOPE</h2><p>In addition to our labor of love, we also need the endurance of hope. We need to be willing to suffer opposition. We need to be a person who endures in hope of the Lord&#8217;s coming. According to Luke 16:9, in the kingdom age many will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles because of our labor.<p>Our hope is in the coming Christ with His glory, and it is also in the reward of the coming kingdom. The endurance of hope is the long life of our work of faith. Through such an endurance we can subdue all kinds of disappointments, discouragements, and impossibilities, and we can also overcome all kinds of oppositions, obstacles, and frustrations. Such an endurance consummates in gaining sinners, feeding the believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church, the Body of Christ, for the kingdom of God and of Christ.<p>Some may say that to be vital is impossible. However, we must say that it is not impossible. Everything is possible. No one has ever overcome Christ. Christ has overcome all His opposers, including us. Since this is the case, He can overcome everyone. We should simply go out with Him. We should go out in His name to let everyone whom we visit know that we are working for Jesus Christ. This will work.<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>HAVING ENTERED THROUGH THE NARROW GATE AND WALKING ON THE CONSTRICTED WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:13-14</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution, Christ displayed the two possible ways of people&#8217;s life and work before God-Matt. 7:13-14:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The broad way:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Through the wide gate.</li>		<li>Leading to destruction.</li>		<li>Many walking on this broad way who have entered through the wide gate.</li>		<li>According to the worldly systems satisfying the natural tastes.</li>		<li>To get the crowd.</li>		<li>To maintain a career of man.</li>		<li>Achieving man&#8217;s enterprise.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The constricted way:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Through the narrow gate.</li>		<li>Leading to life.</li>		<li>Few walking on this constricted way who have found it.</li>		<li>According to the divine regulations fulfilling the spiritual requests.</li>		<li>To bring in God&#8217;s elect.</li>		<li>To bear the testimony of Jesus Christ.</li>		<li>Carrying out God&#8217;s economy.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>For the building up of the church of God-the Body of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The entry in all things must be narrow:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In preaching the gospel.</li>		<li>In teaching the truth.</li>		<li>In edifying the believers.</li>		<li>In maturing the saints.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The ongoing in all the works must be constricted:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In saving the sinners.</li>		<li>In feeding the new believers.</li>		<li>In perfecting the saints.</li>		<li>In building up the church of God-the Body of Christ.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your recovery. We remember, Lord, that this is not our recovery but Yours. How we thank You for the past. Until today we have enjoyed Your rich presence all the time that has made up for our weakness and our shortcomings. Lord, we have fully experienced and realize that we are nothing. Apart from You we can do nothing and have nothing. Lord, we need You. We need Your presence all the time with Your rich mercy and Your abundant blessing. Lord, thank You. It has been Your mercy with Your blessing that has brought us through all the time. Day after day, week after week, month after month, and even year after year, Your mercy has been our strengthening and our trust. Lord, we still ask for Your mercy, for Your blessing, for Your presence, for Your anointing, for Your Spirit, and for Your word. Thank You, Lord. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE DECREE OF THE KINGDOM&#8217;S CONSTITUTION FOR REGULATING GOD&#8217;S PEOPLE&#8217;S LIFE AND WORK</h2><p>In this message we want to fellowship about the narrow gate and the constricted way. In Matthew 7:13-14 the Lord said, &#8220;Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.&#8221; The human thought is that we first walk the way and then enter through the gate. But the divine way, God&#8217;s way, is to enter in through the gate and then walk on the way.<p>This word is in the Lord&#8217;s decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution recorded in Matthew 5-7. Nearly all the Christian teachers refer to this as &#8220;the sermon on the mount.&#8221; But I do not like the word sermon. The Lord was not a professor, giving the people a sermon or a lecture. He is the King. The New Testament opens by presenting to us the kingdom. It is not just the kingdom of God but the kingdom of the heavens.<p>After a long period of time in the Old Testament through thirty-nine books, the New Testament came to present us the first item on the heart of God. This first item is the kingdom, not just the kingdom of God but the kingdom of the heavens. Regretfully, many Christian teachers do not know how to discern between these two aspects of the kingdom. The first aspect of the kingdom is the kingdom of God. That is somewhat general. But the second aspect is the kingdom of the heavens. This is neglected and nearly missed by most Bible teachers. If you go to them and ask them what the difference is between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens, they will say that they are the same. But if you know the book of Matthew, you can see that Matthew stresses the aspect of the kingdom of the heavens to the uttermost. Kingdom of the heavens is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God. Matthew mentions the kingdom of God only four times (12:28; 19:24; 21:31, 43). But all the way through the twenty-eight chapters of Matthew, the kingdom of the heavens is mentioned repeatedly (see note 34 on Matthew 5:3 in the Recovery Version for the denotation of the kingdom of the heavens).<p>The four Gospels present to us a Savior of four sides. He is a &#8220;square&#8221; Savior. The New Jerusalem is not round but square (Rev. 21:16), and our Savior is also square. If you are a &#8220;round&#8221; man, you are crafty. We all need to be square like our Savior. Even the universe has four directions: north, south, east, and west. Christ has only four sides. In Matthew He is the King; in Mark He is the Slave; in Luke He is the Man; and in John He is God.<p>Matthew presents to us the first aspect of Christ. Chapters one through four of Matthew are an introduction. After this introduction the King came. He went to the mountain and in chapters five through seven gave the decree of the constitution of the kingdom which He was going to establish. Matthew 7:13-14 is a little part of this constitution decreed by our King in His kingdom.<p>Some of us may wonder why I am sharing this in our vital group training. We need to see that the decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution is altogether a matter of regulating God&#8217;s people&#8217;s life and work. When I use the word life, I mean living, and when I use the word work, I mean working. I am not referring to just our life within but to our living without, our daily living. God&#8217;s people&#8217;s living and working should be something organic according to the divine regulations fulfilling the spiritual requests. This is fully revealed in the decree of our King in His kingdom&#8217;s constitution.<h2 class=head1>BEING REGULATED ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE IN ORDER TO BE HEALTHY, NORMAL, VITAL BELIEVERS</h2><p>Our vital groups are not wild or reckless. We should be well regulated. If we are not well regulated, we can never be living and vital. If you ask a healthy person why he is healthy, he will tell you that it is because he takes care of the principles of life. A healthy person, for example, will not work at night but during the day. George Muller said that he would not even travel at night. He said that if you travel in the day, that is healthy; but if you travel in the night, that is unhealthy. To sleep at night from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. is very healthy. But to sleep during the day is unhealthy. This is a life principle.<p>God made the heavens and the earth, and He also ordained the night and the day. The night is very important, so it came first. The evening and the morning are one day in Genesis 1 (v. 5). For your health, the night is important. If you take care of your night in a wise way, you will be healthy. Still there are a number of jobs in our society which require people to be on duty at night. We have to thank the nurses and the policemen who do their duty at night, sacrificing themselves for others. But according to the God-ordained principle, the night is for us to sleep, and the day is for our living and working.<p>Healthy people will tell you that they are regulated according to the principles of life. Each one of these principles regulates us. If we eat too fast, we will suffer. Neither should we eat too slow. That is not healthy eating. Healthy eating must be moderate, neither too fast nor too slow, in order to satisfy the inner feeling of our body. When we take care of the principles of life in the human realm, this makes us vital physically.<p>We are being trained to be vital. But in our concept, we think that to be vital is to be like Samson. Samson, however, was not vital. He did not live long. He even had to commit a kind of suicide by sacrificing himself in order to kill others (Judg. 16:30). On the other hand, Boaz was very vital. He was a regular person. In the past summer training, we pointed out that we cannot see anything of life in Judges. But the book of Ruth, a book of four chapters, is a book of life. I believe that if that book were written today, the writer could get a Nobel Prize. That is a marvelous short novel full of life. Boaz was a healthy person; he was vital. Some powerful Pentecostal preachers were immoral, and yet they were powerful. They were like Samson.<p>Do you want to be like Samson or like Boaz? We surely want to be like Boaz, a person who was regulated according to the life principles. He was a vital person. Who brought Christ to you? Samson is not in the lineage of Christ. But Boaz is a most important link in the lineage of Christ (Matt. 1:5). Christ could come to us because of Boaz. This is what it means to be vital.<p>When I was looking to the Lord for this message, the Lord impressed me, &#8220;Tell the saints who love Me and who want to be vital something about the narrow gate and the constricted way.&#8221; To be vital should not be a miracle. The trees do not grow in a miraculous way. We planted many small trees around the meeting hall in Anaheim seventeen years ago, but today they are all big. Their growth was according to the principles of life. God ordained these principles.<p>We are being trained in the God-ordained way revealed in the Bible. The God-ordained way is to have a living and a working which are always narrowed and constricted. The gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life. But the gate is wide and the way is broad which leads to destruction. In the spiritual field, there is no broad way. The way in the spiritual field is always constricted. On this way our freedom is always restricted.<p>Every tree is restricted. If all the trees grew without restriction, that would be a calamity. But all the trees grow and spread in the way of constriction. The trees need the God-ordained constriction plus the human cutting, the human trimming. The trimming is human. The constriction is God-ordained. Even though the trees are constricted according to God&#8217;s ordination, they still need the human hands to trim them.<p>In the spiritual realm, we also need the trimming. A miracle is not mentioned in John 15 concerning the bearing of fruit, but trimming is strongly referred to by the Lord. Are you going to bring forth fruit? You need to be trimmed, pruned (v. 2). To be trimmed is to be constricted. We should not spread too much. We should not be wild but constricted.<p>We may wonder why we cannot see much bearing of fruit among us. The fruit of life does not come by means of a miracle. We need to see that the more we are constricted, the more we are regulated. The more we are regulated, the more we are healthy. Then we are ready to bear fruit. Fruit comes out of our health. A sick tree cannot bear fruit. Living things which are sick cannot produce. God&#8217;s ordination is for living things such as the trees to grow vitally. We Christians should also be growing vitally. To be vital means to be healthy. We need to be healthy and normal. We should not expect to get many persons saved. We should always be prepared to bear one remaining fruit a year. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, give me one fruit per year, remaining fruit, healthy fruit, fruit that is healthy just as I am.&#8221;<p>We might think that the apostle Paul would bring thousands to the Lord, but we can see in Paul&#8217;s history that this was not the case. In Colossians 1:28-29 Paul said that he labored to announce Christ, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present every man full-grown in Christ. He desired to admonish every man, teach every man, and present every man. The &#8220;every man&#8221; work could never be a miracle. Paul was the biggest gift, so we may think he would do everything miraculously. But the Bible tells us that Paul was not able to do that many miracles. Paul was not one who depended upon miracles. He was one who labored all the time.<p>In Acts 20 we see that he was with the saints in Ephesus for three years. He said that he served the Lord and admonished each one of the saints with tears (vv. 19, 31). Tears indicate much hardship and difficulty. He said that he admonished the saints &#8220;night and day&#8221; (v. 31). He taught publicly in the meetings and from house to house (v. 20). He taught publicly, but his work was much more in the &#8220;every man&#8221; way. He was not just giving lectures. Paul tutored each one of the saints.<p>A person who is always soaring in the air cannot bear remaining fruit. Perhaps he will say that he gained three last week and two more this week, but after a year he will not gain one as remaining fruit. He may say, &#8220;Well, last week I got two. Eventually, I realized they were not so good, so I gave them up. Now I have found some better ones.&#8221; Eventually, however, not one is better, and everyone has to be discarded. The mothers are not like this. Every mother loves her child regardless of the child&#8217;s appearance or behavior.<p>T. Austin-Sparks knew this quite well. He came to visit us in Taiwan for the first time in 1955. He said, &#8220;Every mother loves her child. If you are wise, don&#8217;t say anything bad about her child. Otherwise, you will offend her.&#8221; Once a mother brought her child to him, and this child was not so attractive. But he dared not to say that before the mother. The mother handed over the child to him, and he felt he had to say something. He said, &#8220;Oh, what a child!&#8221; This was a neutral saying, but this caused the mother to think, &#8220;My, what a child I have.&#8221; To a mother, all her children are good. We need such a mother&#8217;s heart (1 Thes. 2:7). Concerning a new one, we should not say, &#8220;He is not good material; I am sure he could never be like the apostle Paul.&#8221; If we have such an attitude, we will not be able to bear remaining fruit.<p>We should not work on that many people. Instead, we should always keep just three or four under our hand. We must learn to restrict ourselves in our labor. The Lord&#8217;s constitution in Matthew tells us we have to enter. Then we have to walk. We should not think that we do not need to work too much, since we should not contact too many. This would mean that we have stopped entering the narrow gate and walking on the constricted way. This is against the kingdom constitution to the uttermost. The Lord&#8217;s constitution of His kingdom is that we have to enter and then walk. We have to work.<p>When I say that we should not spread too much, I do not mean that we should not work. Rather, we have to work every day. A good student prepares his lessons every day and does a little bit every day. The problem with us is that we do not work regularly. After being in the training concerning the vital groups, we still may not have started the vital work. We may say that we do not feel that we are vital and that we will work when we become vital. But this is wrong. If we do not work, we can never be vital. If we would work, then we would be vital.<p>What is it to be vital? To be vital is to be common. We Christians should be common in a living way. We should always contact the Lord, trying our best to remain in our spirit, doing everything according to the spirit, and praying unceasingly. This makes us a common believer, a vital believer. I can testify that without a certain amount of prayer, I cannot give a message. The message comes out of my common prayer. If we do not have a time to be with the Lord in the morning to have some prayer, we will become weak and down. The only way to rise up is to pray, &#8220;Lord, forgive me and cleanse me. Lord, anoint me.&#8221; Taking care of the life principles makes us vital.<p>We should carry out what God has ordained. God ordained that we should bear fruit. God ordained that we should contact people for His kingdom&#8217;s sake. This is God&#8217;s ordination, and we have to carry it out. If we do not carry out God&#8217;s ordination, we can never be common. Instead, we will be abnormal Christians. Physically speaking, we must breathe, eat, sleep, and exercise properly if we want to be normal and healthy. If we do not take care of these things, it is impossible for us to be healthy. To be vital simply means to be healthy, and to be healthy we need to breathe, to pray. We have to eat and drink the Lord. We also need to exercise to do something. At least we need to go out twice a week to contact people. This is God&#8217;s ordination, and we have to carry it out. We also need to rest. To sleep means to rest in the Lord. Do not think that to be vital is a miracle. To be vital is just to be common, to be normal.<p>Over thirty years ago, a brother told me that every time he saw me, I was so fresh. He wondered how I could be like this. If I do not pray and touch the Lord in my spirit, I can never be fresh. Instead, I will be stale. The key to my being fresh is that I contact the Lord. This causes me to lead a normal Christian life, to become vital. Often I pray for the churches around the globe. If I do not pray, I feel abnormal. Vitality comes from our being normal, common.<p>Now that we have had some training in the vital groups, we must take action. We should not wait. We must do our duty to carry out God&#8217;s ordination. If we do this, be assured that we will bear at least one remaining fruit yearly. All the life principles are implied in John 15. Bearing fruit is a normal situation of a branch of the vine tree.<p>We need to practice what we have seen in a common way. Then we will be vital, and we will see the Lord&#8217;s blessing following us. In these days I am so grateful to the Lord that His blessing has been following me for so many years. From my hometown, Chefoo, I went to Shanghai. From Shanghai I traveled through the provinces of China. Eventually, I was sent to Taiwan. From Taiwan I went to the Philippines and to southeastern Asia. Then I came to the United States. For more than sixty years, I have seen the Lord&#8217;s blessing following me. If the Lord&#8217;s blessing can be with me, it surely can be with all of us. If the Lord&#8217;s blessing is not with us, we are abnormal; we are not vital. We must learn to enter through the narrow gate and then to walk on the constricted way. Thank the Lord for His constriction.<p>We should not expect to be flourishing and spreading in an unrestricted way. Our going to Russia was not our kind of flourishing. It was the Lord&#8217;s doing. We have seen the Lord&#8217;s constriction even in our going to Russia. When we drive on the highway, we have to drive within the lines. That is constriction. If we do not drive in this way, we will damage ourselves and others.<p>Do not expect to be big. You need to be restricted. The environment in the church life narrows us down and restricts us. We have to enter through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way. Do not expect to do a big work and to become a great person. Just live normally, commonly, always entering through the narrow gate and walking on the constricted way. Then be assured that you will bear remaining fruit each year. Also, many saints will be helped by you to pass through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way.<p>I have been working for the Lord for over sixty years. Nearly every day I am learning to enter through the narrow gate and to walk on the constricted way. I want to be constricted. I do not want to maintain a career of man to achieve man&#8217;s enterprise. Instead, I want to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to carry out God&#8217;s economy. We should live a normal, common Christian life, seeking after the Lord and pursuing Him all the time. Always exercise to enter through the narrow gate and to walk on the constricted way.</body></html>
