<P>The Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross. Sinners, look at His blood-like sweat! Look at His forehead, bleeding from the piercing of thorns! Look at the blood on His back from the stripes! Look at the blood on His hands and feet! Look at the blood beneath His arms! Look at the blood from His whole body! Oh, look at the blood from His very heart! "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22b). This bleeding Savior can forgive your sins. Why do you delay? Do not be cheated by thinking that He bled and suffered only as a pattern for man. The Lord Jesus Himself said, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). Please do not misunderstand; He shed His blood in your stead, and He was crucified in your place. All the suffering He endured was to bear your sins. "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God" (1 Pet. 3:18). "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (2:24). Sinners, if you are oppressed by sin, where are your sins? Will you bear them by yourself or hand them over to Christ? You must remember well: the death of Christ is a death for you. He loves you. Do not harden your heart. You should consider His sufferings so that, on the one hand, you may know His love and, on the other hand, realize the suffering of the coming judgment if you do not believe in Him.</P><P>We have mentioned the suffering in His body. The suffering in His heart was not any less! His disciples escaped and hid. Some cheated and betrayed Him, and some denied Him! How lonesome He was as He hung on the cross. He tread the winepress alone! No one had compassion on Him. It was a dark scene indeed! He is God, the Most Holy One, who hates sin to the uttermost. But He bore the sins of the world; He was made sin for the world. No one can fully understand such humiliation. On the one hand, Satan and his evil demons mocked Him. "If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!" (Matt. 27:40). On the other hand, God abandoned Him. "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). What a desolate scene! Friends, God hates sins even if they are upon His only begotten Son, who was bearing the sins of others. God cannot tolerate sin. He had to forsake His Son even when He was bearing the sins of others. God also has to forsake sinful sinners. If you will not receive Christ as your Savior, you will be forsaken by God forever. O Lord Jesus, the suffering which You endured on the cross is beyond my mind to fathom. O Lord, You suffered to the uttermost. How pitiful You were! I want to receive You as my Savior today.</P><P>Psalm 22 describes the suffering of the Lord Jesus on the cross. David, in his experience, prophesied of the Lord's suffering. Verses 11 through 18 say, "Trouble is near, / For there is none to help me." This speaks of the scattering of the disciples. "Many bulls surround me, / The mighty bulls of Bashan encompass me. / They open their mouth at me, / Like a ravening and roaring lion." This was the rampage of Satan and his forces against the Lord. It could have been through men. "I am poured out like water." Isaiah 53:12 also says, "He poured out His soul unto death." What a suffering to pour out one's life in such a way! "All my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax." This describes His suffering as He hung on the cross. His heart was broken. "My strength is dried up like a shard, / And my tongue is stuck to my jaws; / You have put me in the dust of death." This was the judgment of God's flaming wrath on Him at the cross. This was also bearing man's suffering in the lake of fire. At this time, He said, "I thirst." If you compare this with the rich man's unbearable thirst in Hades, you will begin to realize the suffering of the Lord Jesus. "For dogs surround me; / A congregation of evildoers encloses me." This describes the scene around the cross. "They pierce my hands and feet." This refers to nailing His hands and feet. The Son of God was crucified on a cross! "I count all my bones." This shows the suffering of being nailed on the cross. "They divide my garments to themselves, / And for my clothing they cast lots." This was fully fulfilled on Calvary. I hope that whoever reads these few lines will ponder over these verses from the Bible until the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus becomes a vivid reality before their eyes. Alas, His death was the most cruel death in the history of the world. No one ever died as He did! Because He was full of compassion to redeem all sinners, He died such a death. Readers, if the punishment of the lake of fire cannot cause you to fear, you should be moved by the love He demonstrated on the cross and receive Him.</P><P>Now salvation is accomplished! You do not need to do anything. The Lord Jesus has completed the work of salvation for you. He paid the entire price so that you could receive a free salvation. You do not have to pay anything.</P><P>He came down from heaven so that you could ascend to heaven.</P><P>He bore the offenses of sinners so that you could obtain God's acceptance.</P><P>He was forsaken by God for a time so that you could be welcomed by God forever.</P><P>He became poor so that you might become rich.</P><P>He died on the cross so that you might live in heaven eternally.</P><P>What love can be greater than this? Sinners, please do not remain hard-hearted, and do not delay. This is the moment you should come swiftly to Him. He has not given up hope for you.</P><P>"Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted. / But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed. / We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him" (Isa. 53:4-6).</P><P>"What must I do to be saved?...Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:30-31).</P>
