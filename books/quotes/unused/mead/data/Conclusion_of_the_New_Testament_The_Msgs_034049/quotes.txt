[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #034-049 CONTENTS
[2]  As the fulfillment of Isaiah 11:10, Christ in Revelation 5:5 is called the Root of David.
[3]  This title He is also the Root of David s father Jesse, Isa 11:1 signifies that Christ is the source of David.
[4]  As we shall see, Christ in His humanity was a descendant of David and was born of David.
[5]  But Revelation 5:5 says that Christ is the Root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ.
[6]  In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also the child born to us.
[7]  Luke 2:11-12, the fulfillment of this prophecy, says, A Savior was born to you today in David s city, who is Christ the Lord.
[8]  In the foregoing message we saw that in the fulfillment of certain Old Testament prophecies Christ is both God and man.
[9]  As the God-man, He has prepared the way for God to dispense Himself through humanity into His chosen people.
[10]  If we have an inclusive view concerning Christ as the One who is both God and man, we shall see that He, the very God, became a man so that God may have a way to dispense Himself into us.
[11]  The One Who Bore Our Griefs Infirmities and Carried Our Sorrows Diseases
[12]  Isaiah 53:4 says, Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[13]  In Psalm 8:2 we have the prophecy that Christ would be the One praised by babes and sucklings.
[14]  As the fulfillment of this prophecy, Matthew 21:16 says, And said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying?
[15]  Prophesying that Christ would come to do the will of God, Psalm 40:6-8 says, Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
[16]  From the time of man s fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used for God s chosen people as types Gen 3:21; 4:4; 8:20; 22:13; Exo 12:3-8; Lev 1:2 , pointing to Christ who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God.
[17]  Zechariah 13:7 prophesies concerning Christ as the smitten shepherd: Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
[18]  This verse speaks of a man who is the Lord s fellow, the companion of the Lord of hosts.
[19]  Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver by men, but following that He was smitten on the cross by God Himself.
[20]  In this message we shall see more aspects of Christ s person in His crucifixion and burial as revealed in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.
[21]  When Christ was on the cross, God took all our sins and put them upon Him as the Lamb of God.
[22]  This is a prophecy that Christ would be the One to whom gall and vinegar would be given.
[23]  in the Seventh Year of the Sixty-ninth Week
[24]  Christ, the Messiah, was cut off, crucified, in the seventh year of the sixty-ninth week from the decree to restore and to build Jerusalem.
[25]  In particular, we shall consider prophecies related to Christ s resurrection.
[26]  Therefore, God is a Father of Christ in two senses: first, in the sense that God was the Father of Christ in His divinity from eternity; second, in the sense that God is the Father of Christ in His humanity in resurrection through which Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God.
[27]  This is a prophecy concerning Christ in resurrection seeing the fruit of His labor, the fruit of the travail of His death.
[28]  He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.
[29]  The death of Christ fully satisfied God s righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ s death Rom 3:24 .
[30]  Genesis 49:10 says, The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
[31]  As the Pacificator Christ is not only the Peacemaker; He is also the One who rectifies the situation between us and God and between us and one another.
[32]  As the Christ and the Son of the Living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church Matt 16:16-18 .
[33]  Christ is the One who in His reproducing resurrection declared the Father s name to the brothers and praised Him in the midst of the church.
[34]  Here we have a prophecy of Christ as the Priest ordained by God with an oath according to the order of Melchisedec.
[35]  All the other aspects of Christ revealed in Hebrews, such as the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Captain of salvation, the Apostle, and the real Joshua are the necessary qualifications for Him to be such a Priest, who can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost Heb 7:25 .
[36]  As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God.
[37]  Isaiah 52:13 prophesies concerning Christ as the One exalted, lifted up, and made very high: Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
[38]  Ephesians 1:20 and 21 is the fulfillment of this prophecy: Which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming.
[39]  God s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, with the supreme authority.
[40]  In Psalm 110:1 we have a prophecy regarding the resurrected Christ seated at the right hand of Jehovah: The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
[41]  Altogether, there are more than ten instances in the New Testament where the resurrected Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God.
[42]  Here the first Lord refers to God, and the second, to Christ, whom David called my Lord Matt 22:44-45 .
[43]  After Christ was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation: You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor, and have set Him over the works of Your hands Heb 2:7 .
[44]  The Coming Christ a. As the Son of Man on the Cloud
[45]  The Lord was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, He is now the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God after His resurrection Acts 7:56 , and He will still be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds.
[46]  Zechariah 14:5b says, The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.
[47]  The fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 14:5 is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:14: If we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who are asleep will God, through Jesus, bring together with Him.
[48]  The kingdom which the Lord will bring with Him at His second coming is the eternal kingdom that God will set up on earth Dan 2:44 and which is received from the Ancient of Days and belongs to the Ancient of Days, that is, to God.
[49]  Christ will also be the stone falling on the Gentile kingdoms and scattering them as chaff.
[50]  In His wisdom God uses not only prophecies to predict the coming of Christ but also types and figures to portray Christ.
[51]  Therefore, we can see Christ s person both in the fulfillment of the prophecies and also in the fulfillment of the types and figures in the Old Testament.
[52]  Here in Revelation 2:7 this expression refers to the crucified implied in the tree as a piece of wood 1 Peter 2:24 and resurrected implied in the zoe life John 11:25 Christ who is in the church today, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the enjoyment of all God s redeemed people for eternity Rev 22:2, 14 .
[53]  Adam is a type of Christ Gen 2:7; 1 Cor 15:45, 47; Rom 5:14 .
[54]  In Romans 5:14 we are told that Adam was a type of the coming One, Christ.
[55]  To put on Christ by being baptized into Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment.
[56]  According to 1 Peter 3:20-21, the ark made by Noah and into which he and his family entered is a type of Christ.
[57]  This indicates that the Triune God is in Christ, mingled with human nature typified by the wood used in the ark s construction.
[58]  When Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he slept one night in the open air, using a stone for a pillow.
[59]  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it Gen 28:12 .
[60]  When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven v. 17 . In this dream the ladder did not come down from heaven but was already on earth.
[61]  In Genesis 49:9 we have the type of the lion of Judah: Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he couches, he lies down as a lion lit.
[62]  Another type of Christ is the unleavened bread Exo 12:8, 15, 17-20; 1 Cor 5:8 .
[63]  He is the bread of God v. 33 , He is the living bread v. 51 , and He is the true bread v. 32 . Here we have five characteristics of Christ as our manna, our bread: heavenly bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the living bread, and the true bread.
[64]  After the showbread table is the lampstand Exo 40:24-25 , where we experience Christ as the shining light of life John 1:4; 8:12 .
[65]  The fact that the lampstand follows the showbread table indicates that the light comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.
[66]  When we enjoy Christ as our food, we have light because the life was the light of men John 1:4 .
[67]  The lampstand in the tabernacle Exo 25:31-40 signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ.
[68]  The two rings of gold as receptacles for the carrying poles signify the moving of Christ s intercession, and the poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold signify that Christ s human nature with His divine nature is the strength for the moving of His intercession.
[69]  Exodus 25:21 says, In the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
[70]  Because the law, God s testimony, was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony Exo 25:22; 26:33-34 ; and because the ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony Exo 38:21; Num 1:50,53 .
[71]  The peace offering Lev 3:1 typifies Christ as the Peacemaker Eph 2:15 .
[72]  Apart from Christ, we cannot have peace with God or with others.
[73]  Because there can be no peace in the universe without Christ, we need Him to be our peace offering.
[74]  Furthermore, the drink offering typifies not only Christ Himself, but also the Christ who saturates us with Himself as heavenly wine until He and we become one to be poured out for God s enjoyment and satisfaction.
[75]  The vine typifies Christ as the sacrificing One who cheers God and man; the fig tree, the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our life supply; the pomegranate, the abundance and beauty of the life of Christ; the olive tree, Christ as the man filled with the Spirit and anointed with the Spirit as the oil of exultant joy; the animal life, Christ with His redeeming life; milk and honey, Christ in His richness and sweetness; stones, iron, and copper, Christ as the materials for building and fighting.
[76]  In keeping with the principle seen in Matthew 12, that Christ is greater than all the types, greater than all things and persons in the Old Testament that typify Him, Christ is the greater David.
[77]  Another type of Christ is the temple 1 Kings 6:2 .
[78]  In the Old Testament the temple was the house of God 1 Kings 6:1 .
[79]  As God s house, the temple, which was the enlargement of the tabernacle 1 Kings 6:2, 20; cf.
[80]  In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.
[81]  The King of glory is the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle v. 8 . Psalm 24:7-10 is fulfilled in a full way in Revelation 19:11-16, which speaks of Christ as the Warrior who is King of kings and Lord of lords v. 16 .
[82]  As the King of glory Christ has many diadems on His head v. 12 , His name is called The Word of God v. 13 , and a sharp sword proceeds out of His mouth v. 15 . Christ has been crowned and glorified.
[83]  According to Psalm 36:8 and 9 and Ephesians 5:14, Christ is the light in the temple.
[84]  When we enjoy the fatness of God s house and drink of the river of His pleasures, we are brought to the fountain of life, and this life becomes the light John 1:4 in which we see light.
[85]  The Bible, in the most pure and holy sense, is the record of a divine romance, the romance of a universal couple God in Christ as the Husband and His redeemed people as the wife.
[86]  Often in the Old Testament the Lord refers to Himself as the Husband and to His people as His wife Isa 54:5; 62:5; Jer 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek.
[87]  This divine romance is portrayed in full in Song of Songs, where the seeking one again and again speaks of her beloved, who is a type of Christ as our Beloved, our Husband.
[88]  The Bible speaks of Christ as a stone in different aspects.
[89]  As a stone Christ is solid, strong, and stable.
[90]  First Peter 2:4 says that Christ is a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.
[91]  As the living stone Christ makes us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature so that on Him as the foundation and cornerstone we may be built up a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .
[92]  But on the third day Christ was resurrected, and that resurrection was a sign of God s choosing, a proof that God had chosen Christ to be the stone for His building.
[93]  The fact that Christ, the Lamb of God, is the building stone with seven eyes reveals that the seven eyes of Christ are for God s building.
[94]  Having covered Christ s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament, we come in this message to another classification concerning Christ Christ s person in the parables of the New Testament.
[95]  In recommending Christ John the Baptist said that His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire Matt 3:12 .
[96]  The ministry of John the Baptist was to introduce people to Christ so that Christ might become their Redeemer, life, and all.
[97]  However, some of John s disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to certain of John s practices and turned those practices into a new religion that frustrated people from enjoying Christ.
[98]  Because these disciples of John practiced fasting, they were troubled by the feasting of Christ and His disciples and condemned them for not fasting: Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
[99]  Christ was first the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him Luke 15:22; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 .
[100]  In Matthew 9:17 the Lord Jesus says, Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed.
[101]  This new wine signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor and cheering strength, stirring us to excitement and satisfying us.
[102]  The meal offering is a type of Christ in His humanity, with the fine flour signifying the fineness and evenness of Christ s humanity.
[103]  In Matthew 13:45 and 46 the Lord Jesus says, The kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all, whatever he had, and bought it.
[104]  The merchant in verse 45 is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom.
[105]  In Matthew 13:46 we see Christ s work in gaining the one pearl of great value.
[106]  The parable of the householder Matt 20:1-16 was given by the Lord Jesus to explain His word about the first being last and the last first 19:30 , a word spoken in answer to Peter s question, We have left all and followed You; what then is there for us? v. 27 . Matthew 20:1 and 2 say, The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
[107]  After the Lord Jesus has spoken the parable of the evil husbandmen of the vineyard in Matthew 21:33-46, referring to the Old Testament, likened to a vineyard, with the focus on the labor under the law, He continues to speak another parable, the parable of the marriage feast in Matthew 22:1-14, referring to the New Testament, likened to a marriage feast, with the focus on the enjoyment of grace.
[108]  In the former parable Christ is the Heir who inherits the Father s possession and becomes the cornerstone of God s building, joining together God s people of different sources.
[109]  In the latter parable Christ is the Bridegroom who satisfies the Father s desire and becomes the pleasure of God s invited ones.
[110]  The Bridegroom here signifies Christ as the most pleasant and attractive person John 3:29; Matt 9:15 , and the virgins signify the believers who are looking forward to the coming of Him as the most attractive Person in the night.
[111]  Whereas the unshrunk cloth in Matthew 9:16 signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies the Christ who was treated in crucifixion and who became in resurrection the completed garment to cover us before God.
[112]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ s person in the parables of the New Testament.
[113]  Seeing this, the Pharisee said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, because she is a sinner v. 39 . By His divine attribute of omniscience the Lord knew what His host was saying in his heart v. 40 and said, A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
[114]  The others present said among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins? v. 49 . They did not realize that Christ, as the moneylender in the parable, is the incarnation of the forgiving God, that He is the very God, the One who has authority to forgive sins.
[115]  The record of the parables of watching in Luke 12:35-48 is an allusion to the parables in Matthew 24:42 25:13.
[116]  Hence, the lord in Luke 12:36 and 43 is Christ, as the householder and the bridegroom in Matthew 24:42 25:13 are.
[117]  He is our Lord who will come back to be with us in a pleasant way as one from the marriage feast, and will reward us whether pleasantly or unpleasantly according to how we take care of His appointment to us as His slaves.
[118]  This parable indicates that God as the owner of the vineyard came in the Son to the Jewish people as to a fig tree Matt 21:19; Jer 24:2, 5, 8 planted in God s promised land as the vineyard Matt 21:33 to seek fruit from them.
[119]  This man of noble birth signifies Christ the Savior with the highest status, the status of the God-man.
[120]  In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus said, I am the true vine.
[121]  It is the Father s pleasure that all He is, all the riches of His nature, and all the fullness of the Godhead be the riches of this vine.
[122]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FORTY-NINE CHRIST HIS PERSON 29
[123]  In this message we shall cover Christ s person in the Father s husbandry, in the new covenant, and in the apostles preaching.
[124]  In the Father s husbandry Christ is the vine.
[125]  This true vine, which is Christ the Son, with its branches, which are the believers in the Son, is the organism of the Triune God in God s economy, the divine dispensing, to grow with His riches and express His divine life.
[126]  Let us now go on to consider Christ s person in the new covenant.
[127]  Christ, our Apostle, came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of His divine nature, life, and fullness.
[128]  Christ is the Shedder of the better blood to enact the new covenant.
[129]  The new covenant required the shedding of the blood of the God-man, the shedding of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God 1 John 1:7 .
[130]  Because Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world John 1:29 by offering Himself on the cross as the sacrifice for our sins once for all Heb 10:12 , His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle, has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even the redemption of the transgressions under the first, the old, covenant Heb 9:15 , which transgressions were only covered by animal blood.
[131]  Hebrews 9:14 says, How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
[132]  Moreover, this precious blood speaks to God for us saying that by it, as unveiled in the book of Hebrews, the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ who receive this covenant by faith.
[133]  In the new covenant Christ is also the Mediator.
[134]  As the Mediator Christ goes between us and God, and in resurrection He executes the new covenant, which He bequeathed to us by His death.
[135]  This better covenant was not only enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life Heb 8:10-12 , but also was consummated with Christ s better sacrifices Heb 9:23 , which have accomplished for us eternal redemption Heb 9:12 .
[136]  The new covenant was consummated with better sacrifices and with the blood that speaks better things.
[137]  Christ offered Himself as one sacrifice Heb 9:14; 10:12 .
[138]  As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than those of animals.
[139]  The apostles are such captives; their move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him is God s celebration of Christ s victory over His enemies.
