Actually, we start out being the Body. If you like to be a member, you are a member. If you do not like to be a member, you are nevertheless a member. If you stand on the ground of an individual, you will miss the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Body issues from oneness and culminates in oneness. There needs to be a great change in our realization of the truth. If everyone would stand on the ground of the Body, things would become much easier. If a man does not stand on the proper ground, much trouble will result. One piece of a jigsaw puzzle that is out of place will put many other pieces out of place also.</p><p>The more we deal with the flesh individually, the more flesh there will be. In the Body there is no individual life, only the corporate life. Anything that is contrary to the Head and the Body does not belong to this life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Riches in the Body</h2><p>Many riches are in the Body. The Body is full of light. Where there is the Body, light spontaneously comes. The Body is the place where light is deposited. In the Body we have the greatest light. God's light is found in the Body. How much individual guidance can one have? If you are not the eyes, how are you going to see? The Body is also full of supply. What one cannot obtain individually, he obtains in the Body. If you only existed as an individual member, it would only be a matter of whether or not you were individually useful. But if you are in the Body, whatever function you do not have, others will make up for it. Their function will become your function. The hands can touch, and the feet can walk. This causes the members of the Body to build each other up.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">Love Being Expressed Only in the Body</h2><p>Brother Chow asked concerning love in the Body.</p><p>Brother Nee: It is difficult for an individual to love by himself. Love is in the Body. Ephesians 4 speaks of the "building up of itself in love'' (v. 16). Only when one is in the Body does he know what love is. Philadelphia is manifested in love, not in doctrines. Ephesians 5 speaks of the love in the Body. Verse 29 says, "No one ever hated his own flesh.'' First Corinthians 12:26 says, "Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.'' One only sees a person hurting others' bodies. One seldom sees anyone hurting his own body. When we have the love in the Body, we can speak the truth one to another. With some people, you cannot rebuke them apart from the Body. But when you are in love, you can rebuke them. With some people, you cannot say an honest word apart from the Body. But in the love of the Body, you can say an honest word to them. Love can only be manifested in the Body. Only in the Body is there genuine love.</p><h2 class="head2">Loving in the Body</h2><p>It is difficult to put many things in the Bible into practice unless these things are placed in the right position. When they are in the right position, they can be accomplished easily. It is difficult for one to love individually. But in the Body it is easy to love. For example, the Bible says that we are all priests, and that the office of the priesthood is universal. But if you say to a nominal member in a denomination, "You are a priest,'' and he takes your word and goes to the pastor the following week during the Holy Communion and says to the pastor, "We are all priests; either of us can conduct the ceremony,'' you will find that there will be immediate trouble. What we have spoken cannot be realized in certain places. Some speak of guidance but ignore the Body. Immediately, there is confusion. Guidance is in the Body. Love is also in the Body. When a person is not in the Body, he cannot see the right result.</p><p>Many words which are difficult to say to individuals can be spoken in the Body. This is because with the Body we have the right position. For over twenty years I have not dared to speak concerning money. But today I dare to speak about money. This is because I am in the Body. If a brother has need today, I can take off my hat and ask you for money. If the same thing happened before and we were standing on a different ground, it would have been unthinkable for me to do it. Today, since we are in the Body, if I do not ask you for money, who do I ask for money? In the Body asking others is just like asking oneself.</p><p>This is what we mean by the Body. Only in this Body is there love and authority, and only here can we deal with the flesh. If we are in the Body, not a single word will irritate us or cause us to stumble.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
