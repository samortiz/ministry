When I pray, I also mention your work for our gracious Lord. May our Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you and bless your work by faith, your sufferings of love, and your endurance of hope.</P><P>Brother, I truly thank the Lord because He is leading us step by step. When I was groping in the darkness, He put me in a lonely, quiet country place. In these two years, He has disciplined me, built me up, and made me learn the lessons I needed to experience in order to serve Him. He really graces me, leads me, and keeps me in His grace day by day. He disciplines me so that I may see my own corruption more and more and see the preciousness that is in Him. The Lord said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." I have only just seen this sentence. It truly is limitless light.</P><P>Brother, our heavenly Father is truly the loving Father. He has unlimited mercy and unlimited grace. In the past days, I was discouraged and disappointed many times. Each time He comforted and encouraged me. Although I am sometimes confused and fail many times, He graces me much and has mercy on me so that I will know His love and my hopelessness. The more I think of the love of the Father, the more I feel ashamed of myself.</P><P>Brother, I really thank God that apart from the most precious Bible which He has given us, He has given me The Present Testimony and books like The Spiritual Man. To tell the truth, apart from the Bible, I have received much light from these books. Many times when I am touched by what I have read, I kneel down to thank and praise the Father, saying, "God, I thank You because apart from the precious Bible, You have given me this kind of precious spiritual food, The Present Testimony, etc." Truly, since receiving the light of the truth from these books, I could not fail to give thanks for these books and pray to God. May God build up His children more through the messages in The Present Testimony and the books like The Spiritual Man. May He cause His children everywhere to really benefit from the release of the truth. May the Lord bless the messages in these books so that His truth will be realized soon to glorify Him. Amen!</P><P>I have added a letter concerning the news of the meeting in Yu Ni and prayer requests for the furtherance of my work. Please publish it for those in fellowship through the Collection of Newsletters. I am not very educated, so mistakes are unavoidable in my writing. If you see a word that should be changed, please do so (or ask the editor to correct it for me). Thank you very much. The Lord be with you.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Teng Chih Ch'eng<br>June 15</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
