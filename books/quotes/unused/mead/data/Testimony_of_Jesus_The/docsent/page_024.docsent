   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT ENTERING INTO THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS TODAY S ARK ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LORD S PRESENT REVELATION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 7:1, 16; 9:1; Phil 2:12-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose of God s salvation is not only that man be saved but also that he would be a testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible records that all the saved ones throughout the ages were not only for their salvation but for God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can see this clearly in the case of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time of Noah the generation was degraded, but God came in and called Noah to build an ark Gen 6:11-14a; 1 Pet 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ark was not only to save Noah from God s judgment and eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even more, it was, on the negative side, to save him out of that degraded, perverted generation, and, on the positive side, to usher him into a new age in order to carry out God s eternal plan, His testimony, on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the beginning God s purpose in creating man was to have a corporate expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The corporate man was destined to be God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why man was made in the mold of God s image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man is a copy of God, and God is the mold in which, through which, by which, and with which man was copied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, man is a copy of God, not mainly to serve God, work for Him, or worship Him but to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thought that man is made to worship, serve, and work for God and behave himself for His glory comes from fallen, degraded religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It sounds nice, but in actuality it is a devilish concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is nothing in the beginning of Genesis that tells us that man was made to serve God, worship God, and work for God, or to behave himself for God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, Genesis says that man was made in the image of God in order to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not want us merely to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can work out everything Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He can simply call the things not being as being Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He says, Light, light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can say, New heaven and new earth, and the new heaven and new earth will be here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are nothing, and we can do nothing for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When someone takes a photograph of a person, he has no intention for the photograph to worship him or work for him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His creation, God took a photo of Himself with the intention to glorify Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man was not destined to worship God, serve Him, or work for Him; he was destined to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To glorify God does not mean that we do something to give Him glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not need us to give Him glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, He needs us to simply glorify Him, that is, to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To this end, God may say to us, The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not need you to work for Me, and I do not need you to worship Me. I already have millions of angels serving, working, and ministering for me and also worshipping Me. The four living creatures say, Holy, holy, holy day and night without rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, neither the heavens, the earth, nor all the angels can express Me. Therefore, I need you not to do anything else but to express Me. You were made in My image; you are My photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not try to take the angels job and forget your own function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your destiny is to express Me. However, for man to be a photograph of God cannot in itself adequately and livingly express God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also need Him to enter into us to be our life, our nature, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if we would lose our temper, we must do it by Him to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a photograph would say to the one who took it, I want to worship you, the person would reply, How foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not want you to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the picture may say, Dear master, I would like to shine your shoes and wash your shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The person may reply, You can do nothing for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After this the photo may say, Poor me!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am not qualified to worship or to serve you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am useless and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are here with a burden to bring glad tidings to all the photographs : Do not be disappointed; be encouraged, because you have a higher mission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your destiny is not to worship God, work for Him, or serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your destiny is to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the photographs should be joyful and say, Have you seen the wonderful person whom I express?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah, now I know my function and my destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am here simply to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is our heavenly, wonderful function.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would ask you to read your Bible again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the first two chapters of Genesis there is nothing that says we must work for God, worship God, and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This thought, that fits our natural concept, came from Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Genesis 1 and 2 simply tell us that we are God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are destined eternally to be His image and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This expression is the top worship, work, and service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has the heavens for His throne, the earth for His footstool, and millions of angels to serve Him, work for Him, and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now God needs a corporate expression to glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the real definition, meaning, and significance of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Revelation, the final book of the Bible, the Lord also does not tell us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, the entire book of Revelation shows the need for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jesus needs us not to worship Him or work for Him but to be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The poor thought of Christianity is too selfish, only considering people s own salvation, welfare, peace, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These things are like candy to the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A good mother would never allow her children to eat too much candy and dessert instead of proper, nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sweets damage the proper appetite, and they cause children to have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is an illustration of much of today s teaching in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the itching ears like to hear comfort, peace, joy, and rest 2 Tim 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If someone goes to them to say, You need to be the testimony of Jesus at any cost, they would reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They may say, What do you mean by this?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are saved, and we will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Jesus is sweet and good to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we have trouble, He rescues us, and if we have suffering, He comforts us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our pastor has always taught us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Where did you come from?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is your Eastern mystical philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Almost no Christian minister dares to say something against today s trend of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If he does, his financial support may be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, those sent by the Lord are never afraid of having their supply cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They would give their life for this.</S>
