   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO TENONS FOR BALANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth point with which we must be deeply impressed is related to the two tenons under each board v. 22 . There are always two sides, two aspects, to the things created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a member in the church you are one board, but you must have two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The two tenons may be compared to your two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are one person but with two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your feet are needed for balance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you stand upon one foot, you will eventually lose your balance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must always be balanced by the number two.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only do we have two feet, we also have two hands, two arms, two shoulders, and even two ears and two eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything is in twos for balance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must remember that we always have to be balanced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If anything stands alone, it will lose its balance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must always be checked, tested, and confirmed by others that we may have the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, we will be peculiar and will go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The significance of the two tenons is that they show us our need for balance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have seen before, if a board had only one tenon, it would turn easily and even fall, just as we may easily fall if we stand on one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are walking and wish to turn, we must lift one foot off the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot turn when we are standing on two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians today may easily be turned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are like a board with one tenon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritually speaking, they may face in one direction today, but tomorrow they may face in the opposite direction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy for such ones to be changed and fall because they do not have two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING COMPLETED</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The width of the boards of the tabernacle was one and a half cubits v. 21 , indicating a half measurement of three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One half always needs the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As members of the Body we are just one half.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must remember that we always need another member to make us complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In creation there is the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man is not complete unless he has a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, a woman is not complete unless she is married to a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The couple is the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The husband is one half, and the wife is another half.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes when the brothers and sisters come into the meeting, a wife and her husband may sit together as one whole.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Each is a half, and they both need the other half to make them a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the building of the church our need is to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can never be individuals; we must always be completed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>JOINED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be joined with others by the Holy Spirit and in the Holy Spirit with the holding power of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to 36:31-34, the bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold were in the golden rings, and the golden rings were joined to the gold overlaying the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This typifies the holding strength and the holding power of the divine nature and life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the boards were joined together within the gold and by the golden bars.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The boards could be joined together as one simply because they were in the gold; that is, in type they were in the divine nature and divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The strength and the power for joining together was the bars, which represent the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to 36:31 and 32, there were five bars on the south side, five bars on the north side, and five bars on the west side.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The three groups of bars indicate that this Spirit is the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be impressed with the picture in Exodus 36.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There were three groups of bars, and each group consisted of five bars.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Five is four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, four bars were smaller and one bar, the middle one, was bigger, extending from one end of a wall to the other end. This is a picture of the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Four represents the creature, while one represents the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two added together become five.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the bars signify the Holy Spirit of the Triune God, who takes the full responsibility for God s building by mingling His divine nature with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How could the church be built up with so many believers?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It could be done only in the divine nature and divine life of Christ by the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
