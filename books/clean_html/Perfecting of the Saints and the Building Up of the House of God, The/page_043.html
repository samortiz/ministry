<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING BEING USEFUL IN THE LORD&rsquo;S HAND</h2>
<p>I would like to fellowship concerning our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. As those who serve the Lord, our usefulness is crucial. We want to have spiritual weight, but we must realize that spiritual weight is for us to be useful. As we serve the Lord, the most important matter is our usefulness.</p>
<p>Over the years the Lord has used us for His work on this island. However, we have limited the Lord much more than we have been used by Him. In other words, we have not been as useful as we could have been, because there are problems that hinder our usefulness. These problems limit the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Therefore, we all need to go before the Lord to see how we limit Him. We all limit the Lord in one way or another. We may limit the Lord in one way, in a few ways, or in many ways. Consequently, we are used by the Lord on the one hand, but we limit Him on the other. Instead of being greatly used by the Lord, we are used only in a limited way. This proves that there are problems in our usefulness. If we do not resolve these problems, we will always limit the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Heart Being Enlarged</h2>
<p>The heart of the Lord&rsquo;s worker must be enlarged. A worker must have a large heart. This does not mean that we should be proud. Things in the world and in human society are often full of contradictions. For example, a person with a small heart is more likely to be proud, but a person with a large heart is less likely to be proud. It may seem that a person with a large heart would be proud. However, a person who is truly enlarged is not proud, but a person who is small and fine is often proud. The smaller a person&rsquo;s heart is, the prouder he tends to be, and the larger a person&rsquo;s heart is, the humbler he tends to be.</p>
<p>To have an enlarged heart does not mean to be proud. It means that a person&rsquo;s heart is as inclusive and broad as God&rsquo;s heart. Solomon is an example of a person with a large heart. In 1 Kings God gave Solomon largeness of heart and wisdom (4:29). Most believers know that God gave Solomon wisdom (3:9, 12), but they do not know that God also gave Solomon a large heart. First Kings 4:29 says that largeness of heart is like the sand on the seashore. The seashore encloses the sea. Therefore, God gave Solomon a heart that is larger than the sea.</p>
<p>Everyone who is truly wise has a large heart. A person with a narrow heart is foolish, but a person with a large heart is wise. A large heart and wisdom cannot be separated. A wise person has a large and broad heart. God gave Solomon wisdom by giving him a large heart.</p>
<p>A person who has a large heart is inclusive. A person who aspires to be great or to do a great work does not have a large heart. None of us should have the thought to be great or to do a great work. On the contrary, as those who serve the Lord, we must learn to let God enlarge our heart so that we are considerate of God&rsquo;s heart. When we are concerned with what is on God&rsquo;s heart, our concern will match God&rsquo;s concern, and our intention will match God&rsquo;s intention. This is closely related to our capacity and affects our usefulness in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Some people aim too high and are not realistic. This is not a large heart. These believers dream of the day when they are able to lead a multitude of sinners to salvation and perfect many saints. To have such thoughts is to give free rein to fantasy. This is to have a heart that is not large. We must learn to come before the Lord, be calm, and allow Him to enlarge our heart so that we consider His heart and care for what He cares for. Then our spiritual knowledge and learning will not be one-sided; instead, it will have many sides. An enlarged heart is not one-sided. A person who is one-sided can be compared to an unturned cake (Hosea 7:8). With time he becomes spiritually unbalanced and deficient. A spiritually unbalanced believer does not have an enlarged heart.</p>
<p>If our heart is enlarged, we will not be unbalanced in our spiritual knowledge and learning. Moreover, we will not be unbalanced in the ministry. Every worker should have a particular ministry, but we should not focus on our ministry. If we do, we will suffer loss. We should be general rather than specialized. It is better to know a little of everything than to know only one thing. When the young saints begin to serve the Lord, it is better for them to learn to be general. This is the way that students are taught in the world. A medical student must study every field. He studies the ear, nose, and throat, the eyes, internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics. He must learn everything. After he has a solid base of medical knowledge, he can specialize in one area. He would have serious problems in the future if he were to begin his medical training by specializing in one area. Hence, it is necessary for him to first study general subjects.</p>
<p>Those who are beginning to serve the Lord must learn to do everything. We should not say that we want only to preach the gospel. This is our preference and not the result of being enlarged by God. We must be enlarged by God until we are willing to learn to pray, read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, touch the inner sense, fellowship with the saints, be proper deacons, and even learn to be elders. We should not despise our youth. Not only so, the brothers should learn to do the things that the sisters do, and the sisters should learn to do the things that the brothers do. When we begin to serve the Lord, we must begin with &ldquo;general practice.&rdquo; If after seven years we know only how to read the Bible or how to enter our private room and pray, we will not be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The best preparation for one who serves the Lord is for him to endeavor to learn as many things as possible in the first ten years of his service. Any believer who wants to learn how to serve the Lord should be helped to learn every service. It may be that he learns one service for two months and then another service for another two months. It is important for him to learn to do everything. If he serves in this way, after a while he will be clear concerning the focus of his service.</p>
<p>A believer who is restricted to a particular service is not very useful. A believer who is useful is not restricted in his service. He can be specialized in one thing but not restricted to one thing. Rather, he does many things and functions in many areas so that he is not limited in his ministry.</p>
