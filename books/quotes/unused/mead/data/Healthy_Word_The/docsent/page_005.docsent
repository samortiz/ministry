   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: I recently met some brothers who are in the same profession as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My tendency is to invite the brothers to work together for the gospel s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, I wonder if this is the Lord or something of my self, my natural man, trying to organize or have an activity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: A tendency to try to organize something for the gospel comes from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not need to organize or initiate anything, because Christ is the Lord and the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have no right to make a decision concerning what to do or what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are merely slaves of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to pray, Lord, I am not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not have the right to initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, I just want to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I live because You live.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If You go, I go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What You do, I do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If You stay, I stay.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are truly living Christ, we even do not need to seek His leading in how to preach the gospel, for the gospel will be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way we simplify our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We often complicate the Christian life by thinking about different ways and by initiating different activities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should forget about all the ways and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we rise up in the morning, we should simply worship the Lord and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When many Christians pray, they are trying to force the Lord to do something for them, because they have already made a decision and planned something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to realize that this kind of prayer insults the Lord s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I used to plan and make decisions and then ask the Lord to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I regret that I insulted the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today I have no plan, and I initiate nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every morning I simply pray, Lord, thank You for giving me another day to worship You, live You, enjoy You, walk with You, and take You as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, strengthen me and hold me in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After praying like this, we should simply follow the Lord throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord leads us to work together with some other brothers, we should simply do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Lord does not lead us to do something, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result of living in this way, we will have no burdens, complications, troubles, or anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will have nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Matthew 11:30 the Lord said, My yoke is easy and My burden is light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for easy means pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s burden is pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, we do not bear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply live Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not complicate our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord does not need us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If He wants something to be accomplished, He can do it simply by speaking a word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 1:3 says, God said, Let there be light; and there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord does not need us to accomplish something for Him, but He needs us to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we see this, we will be liberated from all burdens, complications, considerations, and anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, we will be full of Christ as peace, rest, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Question: Before I came into the church life in the Lord s recovery, I met with different religious groups, which had different doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Recently, when I began reading the Bible, I quickly became distracted, thinking about doctrinal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Answer: Because today s Christianity has become complicated and confused, it is very difficult for a new believer to discern all the different teachings and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, the Bible clearly reveals that there is only one God, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day God in the Son became a genuine man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He died on the cross for our sins to accomplish redemption for us by the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After three days He resurrected physically and spiritually and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now, as our Savior, Lord, and Master, He is sitting at the right hand of God, and one day He will come back to receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, He is now the life-giving Spirit in our spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, today while He is in the heavens and we are waiting on the earth for His coming back, we can live by Him, taking Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to fellowship with Him, pray to Him, and read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The basic items of the Christian faith revealed in the Bible are simple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to come back to the Bible and to the Lord in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also need to meet with the saints in the Lord s recovery in a pure, simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never bring in different concepts to complicate the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must keep the Lord s recovery pure and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason, we should not have different concepts, ways, activities, movements, or organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should have only the Bible and the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need only to live by Him according to the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to be simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Especially if we have spent time in different religious groups, thoughts will often come into our mind to bother, distract, veil, and cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we need to pray that the Lord will cover our mind and thoughts with His helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then the Lord will save us from many distracting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we pray in this way, we will be preserved in a simple and pure way to enjoy the Lord s presence and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Question: I desire to have a simple, uncomplicated enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, I often feel that there are many distracting complications in me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How can I get rid of them?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Answer: We do not need to get rid of these complications.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should simply ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to reject the thought that complications are still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After we repent and ask the Lord to cover our mind, we should not believe that complications are still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>According to our consciousness, they may still be in us, but this is a lie from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to declare to the enemy, Any sense I have of complications in me is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only God is the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are no complications in me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The simplicity of Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All I have is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, our human spirit is indwelt by Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and these two spirits are mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We simply need to walk in this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should deny any distracting thoughts that come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the devil comes to us with some accusation, we should not argue with him but flee to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Satan s occupation is to bother us, and he is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He will usually not do something big but will find a small way to bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As long as he bothers us, he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to see through his subtlety and not respond to his proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should deny any distracting thoughts and stay in our spirit, enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Question: I want to go on with the Lord and to express Him in my daily life, but it seems that I live two lives one at my job and another outside my job.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I am very busy the whole time I am at work.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I do not know how to lay hold of the Lord in the midst of all that I have to do at my job.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Answer: The subtle enemy often uses a fact related to our living to deceive us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The biggest lie is often told using the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Apparently, something spoken may be a fact, but the intention in speaking it is to deceive.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You should not think that you have two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You need to tell the enemy and the whole universe, I do not believe that I have two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I have only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Also, begin every day by worshipping and contacting the Lord, telling Him, Lord, thank You for another day for me to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Lord, be with me today.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Strengthen me, sustain me, and hold me in Your hand this whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I may forget You, Lord, but You would never forget me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I do not trust in my ability or my faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Lord, I put my trust fully in You for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Many of us have been influenced by different doctrines from our background in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>As a result, we have considerations that are frustrations and distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need to deny, ignore, and not believe all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We believe only one thing, that is, the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our trust is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We do not need to plan or prepare how we will face different situations in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have no expectation, plan, or schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We have only the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>All day, and especially in the morning, we contact Him and allow Him to sustain us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We do not need to be concerned for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We never have tomorrow; we always have only today.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Every day is today.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The Christian life is simple, real, living, sweet, and joyful.</S>
