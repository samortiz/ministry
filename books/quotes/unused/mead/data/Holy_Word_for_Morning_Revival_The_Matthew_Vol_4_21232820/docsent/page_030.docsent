   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 20 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 27:1-5, 15, 24, 26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to 1 Pilate the governor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But they said, What is that to us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You see to that yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>5 And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>15 Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>24 And Pilate took water and 1 washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this 2 man's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>26 Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he 1 scourged and delivered up to be 2 crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spiritual significance of chapter twenty-seven is that it is related to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 27:19 Pilate's wife referred to the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and in verse 24 Pilate himself called Him a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very meaningful that Matthew inserted the record of the destiny of Judas into his account of Pilate's judgment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The record of Judas testifies of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even the betrayer of the Lord Jesus eventually realized that He was a righteous man and that what had been done to Him was altogether unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, "We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is better that we use it to buy a parcel of land for burying strangers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6-7 ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that even the religious leaders had a formal righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The concept here in chapter twenty-seven is rather deep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This contrast implies that the kingdom of the world cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason it cannot stand is that it is not built upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 1 Pilate, an agent of Caesar Tiberius, was a Roman procurator in Judea Palestine from A.D. 26-35.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not long after he unjustly delivered up the Lord Jesus to be crucified, his rule ended abruptly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was banished and committed suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the evil conspiracy the Jewish religionists convinced the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>24 1 This was to appease his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>24 2 Some MSS add, righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>26 1 This utterly exposed the darkness and injustice of politics!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This injustice fulfilled Isa 53:5, 8.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>26 2 The Jewish death penalty was carried out by stoning Lev 20:2, 27; 24:14; Deut 13:10; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Crucifixion was a heathen practice Ezra 6:11 adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus' being crucified was a fulfillment not only of the Old Testament prophecies Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13; Num 21:8-9 but also of the Lord's word concerning how He would die John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These could not have been fulfilled by stoning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>See note 32 1 in John 18.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
