   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Sacrament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the sacrament, the same council quoted Philippians 2 which says that the Lord Jesus was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross v. 8 . The Catholic Church declares that in the holy mass, the Lord's obedience is so extraordinary that He becomes not only obedient to the Father but to men as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is willing to come down from heaven and to remain on the altar in obedience to man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It says that in the sacrament, the Lord lies still and allows men to carry Him to the righteous as well as to the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was obedient to His parents on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He is obedient to men, and His obedience will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Catholic Church goes on to say that the most wonderful thing about this obedience is His willingness to obey the creature, that is, the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What an insult this is to God's glory!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How deep and great is this indescribable offense!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basis of its teaching about the mass is John 6:55, in which the Lord said that His flesh is true food and His blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, when the Lord said that His flesh is food, He was referring to receiving His life, not to the bread in His supper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Catholic Church says that whoever partakes of the bread is saved and that whoever does not partake of the bread is damned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a great confusion of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord spoke such a word in John 6, He was still alive on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had not died yet, and His words could not have referred to the bread of His supper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the night the Lord instituted His supper, He said, "Take, eat; this is My body."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Roman Catholic Church makes the bread the physical body of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord also says that He is the door John 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Catholic interpretation, this must mean a real wooden door.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord also says that He is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Catholic Church's interpretation, this would mean that He is a physical vine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we cannot become a physical branch even if the Lord becomes a physical vine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This twists the Scripture; it has gone beyond the boundary of proper biblical interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no such thing as transubstantiation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that we will all see through such a serious heresy as transubstantiation in the mass.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Holding Back the Cup</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us consider the reason the Catholic Church holds back the cup when it administers the mass to ordinary believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the catechism of the above mentioned council, several reasons are given for holding back the cup: 1 to avoid the embarrassment of spilling "the Lord's blood," 2 to enable anyone to receive such life, even if he is sick, 3 to accommodate those who cannot take wine, 4 because wine is harmful to the human body, and 5 because wine is not available in some places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to understand that transubstantiation is not the greatest heresy; the greatest heresy is the teaching concerning sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one decree of the above mentioned council, it says that the body and blood of Christ are daily presented on the altar by the priests, together with His soul and His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It says that there is no substantive difference between the holy sacrifice offered at mass and the sacrifice offered on Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It considers the worship conducted by the Church during the mass the same as the sacrifice Christ offered to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason it considers the mass to be a sacrifice is because the Roman Catholic Church is run by a priesthood, and this priesthood requires the offering of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The mass is the result of its search for a valid sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament we are told in Hebrews that the Lord accomplished eternal redemption when He offered up Himself once.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament the priests stood to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament our Priest has sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By offering Himself once, He became the source of eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 7:26 and 27 say that Christ is a priest to Himself; He is both the priest and the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can offer Him to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hebrews speaks of the Lord offering Himself up four times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament we find the altar, the laver, the table, and the lampstand in the tabernacle, but we do not find any chair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the priests offered sacrifices by standing up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could the priests sit down and rest when sin was still present outside the sanctuary?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as there are sheep in the pit, the Sabbath cannot be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, at the consummation of the ages, the Lord has offered Himself once and has accomplished the eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has sat down at the right hand of the Father; He has rested.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet some people are saying that the redemption at Golgotha is not complete and that man must go to God with the help of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From this we can see what a heresy this teaching concerning the sacrifice is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The priesthood is even a greater heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one is qualified to be a priest to the Lord, and no one can be the Lord's priest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord has offered Himself up once, and redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no more sacrifice for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Besides Him there is no other priest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without Him no one can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to tell the priests, "You lowly creatures, what makes you think that you are qualified to be the Lord's priests?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to show the new ones what Hebrews 10:1, 4, and 11 say about Old Testament sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Old Testament priests stood daily in their service to God, offering the same sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These sacrifices could never take away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But Hebrews 9:28 says that the Lord offered Himself once and bore the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 12 says that the Lord entered once for all into the Holy of Holies through His own blood, obtaining an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hebrews 7:27 says that He does not need to offer sacrifices daily, as the high priests did, because He did it once for all when He offered up Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since the Lord has done it once for all, it is useless for anyone to continue to offer more sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The redemption at Calvary is completed once for all; there is no need of a second offering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to be clear about Hebrews 9:26.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the Lord's work was not complete, the sacrifice at Golgotha would not have been enough and there would have been the need of repeated sacrifices on Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first sacrifice would have been insufficient, and there would have to be additional sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If this were the case, the Lord would have to suffer many times since the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But by offering Himself up once at the consummation of the ages, He has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The same decree also states that the mass is a true sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every time the priests consecrate the mass, the Lord is once more being offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As the people receive the elements, the priests meditate on the Lord's death and His love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This sounds nice, but this is an offense to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The blasphemers who wrote these things wrote out of their natural sentiments; these words are worth nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Catholic Church tries to make men believe that the bread they receive is transformed, that it is the Lord's flesh and body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It teaches men to worship it as they would worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As the priests lift up the bread, they call upon the worshippers to worship it as they would worship the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>CONCERNING POLITICS</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Another thing associated with the teaching of Jezebel is the Catholic Church's ties with earthly politics.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since 1913 Rome has been advancing these ties vigorously.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By 1949 great developments have been made in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In 1913 fourteen nations had diplomatic ties with Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By 1949 seventy nations had diplomatic ties with Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will see the power of the Roman Catholic Church greatly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>During the above same period, the number of Protestants in China decreased by a third, while the number of Roman Catholics increased six times.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The number of converts in the Catholic Church increased by a hundred thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This shows us that the Roman Catholic Church will be greatly revived one day.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is prophesied in Revelation 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to be watchful and to be on the alert concerning the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have the prophetic word made more firm, to which we do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not live as though there was no prophetic word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We cannot allow the Catholic teachings of Jezebel to defile us.</S>
