   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine life is God, and God is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If He were like a piece of gold and not a Spirit, how could He get into us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He must be a Spirit to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, God can get into man only because man has something that has come out of God, the breath of God, which became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To grow in the growth of life is altogether a matter of the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We, who have the breath of God as our spirit, must grow by this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to grow in life we should not merely exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need bodily exercise, but this does not help us to grow in life either.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To grow in God as life we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we exercise our spirit, we make the way for God to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The unbelievers do not have God growing in them because they do not know how to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason we have to go to them to tell them that they need God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They need to speak something out of the depths of their being, their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they do this, they will exercise their spirit, and when they exercise their spirit, God will have a way to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real salvation is the grafting of an uncultivated, wild branch into Christ as the cultivated tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have to learn to preach the gospel in this way rather than in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The old way is to say, "Dear friend, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today you are living a poor life, always sinning and fighting with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You don't have happiness, and, moreover, you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, you have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus died for you, and you can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then you will have a happy life, and you will go to a happy place, heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not the deeper gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the shallow gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord raised up new light among us, the new way, and brought us into it, a certain number of arguments were aroused.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some said that to preach the gospel was not something new; they had done it before and were still doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in what way are we preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may be in the shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians do not know how to preach the gospel in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The deeper gospel is something new, yet something ancient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in the Bible but not in man's natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, I have the burden to conduct a training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would like to train the saints to know things, not in a superficial way but in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we preach the gospel in this deeper way, we do not touch the "flesh and bone" of man; we touch the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go to preach such a gospel and touch the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When man touches his own spirit, God has a way to enter into him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then this man is grafted into Christ; he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must remember the principle of our growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To grow in life is to grow with the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to increase with the increase of God who is life.</S>
