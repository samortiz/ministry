We thank You from our depths that in Your recovery You have never stopped speaking to us; You have been speaking to us again and again. Lord, we believe that this time You will still speak to us a word concerning Your salvation from another angle. Your word is light and revelation; Your word is also spirit and life. May You be one spirit with us here to speak with us, to speak in our speaking, and even to make our speaking Your speaking. Lord, cause us to forget the past by taking away our old veils layer by layer that we may listen in quietness to Your fresh words, words which You have never spoken in our midst before. Lord, bestow Your grace upon us. We trust in Your precious blood, in Your mercy, in Your grace, and even more in Your presence. We ask You to anoint this meeting, anoint every person, anoint every action, and anoint all our words, whether testimonies, sharings, or prophesyings. Amen.<p>In this conference we want to see the complete salvation of God, especially its organic aspect. The central burden of the messages may be expressed by the following statements:<p>1)The complete salvation of God has two aspects-the judicial aspect and the organic aspect.<p>2)The judicial aspect is the procedure of God&#8217;s salvation through the redemption of Christ for God&#8217;s salvation to fully meet the righteous requirement of His law.<p>3)The organic aspect is the fulfillment of God&#8217;s salvation through the life of Christ for the believers to be transformed and to grow and mature in the life of God.<p>4)The salvation of God is with Christ as the center, the Body of Christ as the line, and the New Jerusalem as the goal, and is fully accomplished through the life-giving Spirit.<p>We have also used the main points of the messages to compose a new hymn (to the tune of Hymns, #837) [The following is a literal translation from Chinese.]:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>God, the saving carried out by Your life<br>	Fully meets the requirement of Your righteousness;<br>	Your salvation is perfect, faultless,<br>	Not only right judicially but also rich organically.<br><br></li>	<li>Redemption is accomplished judicially,<br>	Salvation is carried out organically;<br>	Judicially, Your righteousness is satisfied,<br>	Organically, Your heart&#8217;s desire is fulfilled.<br><br></li>	<li>Judicially, I have been justified by You,<br>	Organically, I am being made one with You:<br>	Regenerating me to be a God-man,<br>	Sanctifying me dispositionally, and renewing my whole being.<br><br></li>	<li>Transforming and conforming me to the Lord&#8217;s glorious image,<br>	Manifesting the metabolism in life;<br>	Maturing in life to become a full-grown man,<br>	Coordinating with others to be built up as one Body.<br><br></li>	<li>My body will be redeemed and enter into glory,<br>	I will attain sonship to its highest portion;<br>	Mingled with You to be a mutual dwelling,<br>	The holy city New Jerusalem becomes my song.</li>	</ol><h2 class=head1>THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD HAVING TWO ASPECTS-THE JUDICIAL ASPECT AND THE ORGANIC ASPECT</h2><p>The complete salvation of God has two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. It is not that easy to understand what organic is and what judicial is. However, by the word judicial we know it has something to do with the law, and by the word organic we know it has something to do with life. Therefore, God&#8217;s complete salvation has both the judicial aspect, an aspect related to the law, and the organic aspect, an aspect related to life.<p>We all know that God so loved the people of the world that He gave His only begotten Son to them that they may have eternal life (John 3:16). God gave His only begotten Son to the people of the world that they may receive eternal life by believing into Him and receiving Him. In eternity God had a good pleasure, His heart&#8217;s desire, to be one with man, even to make man the same as He to be His species. Hence, in the creation of man He created man in His image and after His likeness for man to become a vessel to contain Him. He created the plants and the animals each after their own kind; when He created man, however, He created him in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:11-12, 20-21, 24-27). Image is something inward and likeness is something outward. Since God created man in that way, was the created Adam man or God? Yes, he was a man but he had God&#8217;s image and God&#8217;s likeness. Therefore, at the time of creation, the idea concerning a God-man was already there.<p>In the New Testament God came to regenerate man with Himself as life. John 1:12 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&#8221; When we become children of God, we have God&#8217;s life and nature. Since goats beget goats and cows beget cows, surely God begets gods. If cows begot cows and goats begot goats yet God begot human beings, this would indeed be something strange. That which is begotten must be the same as its begetter. There is no such thing as a cow giving birth to a donkey or a goat giving birth to a dog. God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s intent is to make us the same as He is that we may be exactly like Him not only in the inward image and the outward likeness but also in His life and nature. We the regenerated people of God have the life of God and also the nature of God. This is really precious.<p>However, the God-created man sinned and fell by following Satan; thus, man violated God&#8217;s righteousness. God so loved the people of the world that He even wanted to make man the same as He is by His life. Yet man was seduced by Satan and became fallen by committing sin; thus, man violated the righteousness of God. What man violated was not God&#8217;s grace or God&#8217;s love but God&#8217;s righteousness. According to the entire holy Scriptures, God&#8217;s righteousness is God&#8217;s principle of doing things. Whatever God does is righteous, and His righteousness as the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14) is the strictest. Therefore, we see two things here: God&#8217;s love and God&#8217;s righteousness. According to His love, God wants to make man the same as He is. However, man sinned and violated God&#8217;s righteousness. God&#8217;s righteousness is strict; whatever God wants to do for man must meet the requirement of His righteousness. Whatever is required by righteousness becomes the law. Therefore, the Bible shows us that after God&#8217;s creation of man and man&#8217;s fall, after a period of time, God came to give man the law. The law of God was written and enacted according to His righteousness. Since God is righteous, every item of the law enacted by Him is righteous, and every item is a righteous requirement; hence, the law becomes the law of righteousness (Rom. 8:4a; 9:31).<p>Therefore, concerning all that God wants to do for man according to His heart&#8217;s desire, there is a great need judicially. All that God wants to do for man organically according to His life requires that God redeem the fallen sinners back judicially according to His righteous requirement. God&#8217;s righteousness requires that God redeem the sinners. It is as if God&#8217;s righteousness says to God, &#8220;O God, it is good that You love them, and it is also good that You desire to carry out many things in them organically. But You must first redeem them to satisfy the requirements of Your righteous law.&#8221; This is redemption. By redeeming the sinners judicially, God may freely do as He pleases by His life organically according to His heart&#8217;s desire. &#8220;To do as one pleases&#8221; does not sound very positive. How can we say that God may do as He pleases? Yes, indeed, because of His redemption, today our God may do as He pleases. If He wants to save a robber, He may do so; if He wants to save a prostitute, He may also do so. Hence, in the Bible we see a robber saved (Luke 23:39-43) and we also see harlots saved (Matt. 21:31-32; cf. Luke 7:37; John 4:17-18). Today God truly may do as He pleases. Thus, God&#8217;s complete salvation comprises the redemption required judicially and the salvation accomplished through God&#8217;s life organically. We need to distinguish between these three things: God&#8217;s redemption, which is judicial; God&#8217;s salvation, which is organic; and God&#8217;s complete salvation, which is the totality of God&#8217;s redemption and God&#8217;s salvation.<h2 class=head1>SATAN&#8217;S SURVEILLANCE OF GOD</h2><p>God was willing to allow the highest angel created by Him (Ezek. 28:13-14) to rebel against Him with a group of angels and be His opposer. In this way Satan has become &#8220;the opposition party&#8221; in the universe particularly to watch over God and oppose God. The Bible tells us that Satan opposes God and rebels against God. Therefore, God has convicted him, ordering that he be thrown into the bottomless pit for his termination (Isa. 14:12-15). However, this punishment has not been executed. The judgment paper is here, but the execution is not yet. Hence, Satan is still at large in the universe. Although the Bible says that God has bound Satan, how much He binds Satan is up to Him. This is why we have so many hardships and afflictions, natural disasters and man-made calamities, failures and frustrations, etc. These things happen because Satan is still here disturbing us. God is sovereign over everything. He announced the verdict that Satan would be cast into the abyss, but He did not remove Satan right away. If He had removed Satan, He would not have an opposition party. God wants to keep an opposition party in order to prove His perfection. Without an opposition party, God&#8217;s perfection cannot be manifested. God may do whatever He wants for Himself, and whatever He says, that is it. However, an opposition party is here to prove that whatever God says and does are in accord with His righteous law.<p>Furthermore, God granted His opposer, Satan, the freedom to be an observer in the councils held by Him with His angels and even the privilege to criticize His doings (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6). When God was holding a meeting with His angels, Satan also went to observe. The angels did not stop him, because they knew that he had the privilege. Satan went into the councils and even made some criticisms. The book of Job shows us that God and Satan had a conversation. Satan said to God, &#8220;You see how Job is. You have given him so many good things. You have won him over to be Your perfect one.&#8221; God said, &#8220;Okay, from now on, I turn Job over to you. You may do as you like but you may not take his life.&#8221; Not only was this so in Job&#8217;s time, but even to this day Satan is still accusing us before God day and night (Rev. 12:10).<p>Hence, all that God wants to do for man through His life organically according to His love must also take care of the criticisms of His opposer, Satan. This also requires that the salvation which God wants to accomplish for man, including redemption and saving, first meet the judicial requirement of God&#8217;s righteousness.<h2 class=head1>THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&#8217;S JUDICIAL REQUIREMENT AS THE PROCEDURE AND THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHAT GOD WANTS TO DO ORGANICALLY AS THE PURPOSE</h2><p>In the complete salvation of God, what He does in the judicial aspect is the procedure, and what He does in the organic aspect is the purpose. In the aspect of procedure, that which God has fulfilled according to His judicial requirement is redemption, including forgiveness of sins, washing away of sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and positional sanctification. We were sinners under God&#8217;s condemnation and also enemies of God, but now we have been forgiven, washed from our sins, justified by God, reconciled to God, and sanctified unto God positionally. This is to be redeemed. However, the complete salvation of God is not just this much. If you have received only these five items of redemption, what you have received is but a one-sided salvation and not the complete salvation. The first aspect of God&#8217;s complete salvation is the judicial aspect, and what it accomplished is for us to be forgiven of our sins, washed from our sins, justified, reconciled to God, and sanctified positionally. These five items qualify and position us to enter into the grace of God. Romans 5:2 says, &#8220;We have obtained access...into this grace in which we stand.&#8221; How can a sinner obtain access into the grace of God? There must be the fulfillment of the judicial aspect so that the sinner may receive forgiveness of sins, washing away of sins, justification by God, reconciliation to God, and positional sanctification. All of these items are a matter of procedure, qualification, and position. The judicial aspect qualifies and positions us sinners to enter into the grace of God to enjoy the salvation which God has accomplished for us according to His life organically in the aspect of purpose (Rom. 5:10). Here we see that God has accomplished a salvation with two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect. Redemption is accomplished judicially, and saving is carried out organically.<p>The second aspect of God&#8217;s complete salvation is the aspect of purpose. In the aspect of purpose, that which God has carried out by His life organically is salvation, including (1) regeneration for us to receive the eternal life of God, (2) shepherding for us to grow and exist in the divine life, (3) sanctification in our disposition, (4) renewing in our mind, (5) transformation in our image, issuing in (6) God&#8217;s building, (7) conformation to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son, that is, maturity in the divine life, and (8) glorification, which is the consummation of God&#8217;s eternal economy (Rom. 8:30). Whereas that which is accomplished judicially is the initial step as redemption with five items, that which is carried out organically is a further step as salvation, which is different from redemption and includes eight items. Redemption is accomplished judicially, whereas salvation is carried out organically. The eight items in the organic aspect issue in the church of God to constitute the Body of Christ which will consummate the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s eternal economy, that is, an organism constituted with the processed Triune God and His regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified elect joined and mingled as one to be the enlargement and expression of God in eternity.<p>The processed Triune God and His regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified elect will be joined and mingled as one to constitute an organism as the enlargement and expression of God in eternity. In the beginning of Genesis, when God created Adam, Adam was all alone without a counterpart. Then God took a rib out of Adam and built it into a woman. Adam and this woman were joined as one (Gen. 2:21-24). This is the increase of Adam. In John 3, a chapter on regeneration, John said, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&#8221; (v. 29). The Bridegroom is Christ, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated people, who have the divine life and nature, as the increase of Christ, the corporate bride. Therefore, in verse 30 John went on to say, &#8220;He must increase, but I must decrease.&#8221; The increase in this verse is the bride in the preceding verse, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated people. Eventually, Revelation 21 unveils to us that the entire New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb, Christ (vv. 2, 9), becomes the enlargement and expression of God.<p>Unfortunately, most of the believers through the generations have considered the redemption which God accomplished for us in procedure as the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation, stressing the five items which God has accomplished for us in the aspect of redemption according to His righteousness judicially, while neglecting the eight items which God will do for us in the aspect of salvation through His life organically. This is a great shortcoming of the majority of believers today in the salvation in God&#8217;s life. As a result, they neglect the pursuing and growing unto full growth in God&#8217;s life and hardly see anything concerning the building of the Body of Christ, much less the consummation of the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s eternal economy, which is the New Jerusalem. Moreover, even concerning the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the entire Bible, nearly no one knows what it is, yet some consider the New Jerusalem as the heaven where the believers will go after their death. Because of the lack of knowledge concerning the universal oneness of Christ and the unique goal of God&#8217;s economy, they form different sects and establish their own churches according to the partial truths of their fragmentary seeing, thus resulting in the divided and confused condition of Christianity today.<h2 class=head1>THE JUDICIAL ASPECT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>We need to be clear that the complete salvation of God is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. The judicial aspect is according to the righteousness of God (Rom. 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31) as the procedure of God&#8217;s salvation to satisfy the requirements of God&#8217;s righteous law on the sinners. It is for sinners to be forgiven before God (Luke 24:47), washed (Heb. 1:3), justified (Rom. 3:24-25), reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10a), and sanctified unto God positionally (1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 13:12), thereby entering into the grace of God for the accomplishment of the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation. However, redemption as the judicial aspect cannot carry out the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation, because it is merely the procedure, not the purpose. For example, a cook spends a great amount of time cooking in the kitchen to prepare a feast. However, the cooking is not his purpose but merely a procedure. Later when the guests are invited to enjoy the feast, that is the purpose of the cooking. Likewise, in the salvation of God we should not remain in the aspect of procedure, the judicial aspect; rather, we should go on to the aspect of purpose, the organic aspect.<h2 class=head1>THE ORGANIC ASPECT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>The organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation is through the life of God (Rom. 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b). Whereas the judicial aspect is according to the righteousness of God to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption, the organic aspect is through the life of God to carry out God&#8217;s salvation, including regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification. This is the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation to accomplish all that God wants to achieve in the believers in His economy through His divine life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>REGENERATION AND SHEPHERDING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 1 Pet. 1:23; John 3:15, 36; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; John 21:15-17; Eph. 4:12; 1 Pet. 5:1, 4; John 14:6; 10:9-11, 14-16; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4; Heb. 13:20; Rev. 7:16-17</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the propagation and nourishment of the divine life.</li><li>Regeneration:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Regeneration being the center of God&#8217;s entire salvation and the commencement of God&#8217;s salvation in its organic aspect:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It being to regenerate and re-create the believers in their spirit through the Spirit of God-John 3:6b.</li>		<li>Through God&#8217;s word of life-1 Pet. 1:23.</li>		<li>For the believers to have the spiritual life of God in addition to their natural life-John 3:15.</li>		<li>The spiritual life of God being divine and eternal-John 3:36.</li>		<li>This divine life being the basis and means of the believers&#8217; spiritual life and living.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Such a regeneration being a washing in God&#8217;s salvation (Titus 3:5), and this washing being a great renewing of the believers by God&#8217;s salvation to enable them to get rid of all that is of their natural life and the old creation and become God&#8217;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</li>	</ol></li><li>Shepherding:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The second step of the Triune God&#8217;s organic salvation.</li>	<li>Shepherding including feeding-1 Pet. 2:2; John 21:15-17; Eph. 4:11; 1 Pet. 5:1-4.</li>	<li>The Lord being the life and the good Shepherd-John 14:6; 10:9-11, 14-16.</li>	<li>The Lord being the Chief Shepherd and the great Shepherd-1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4; Heb. 13:20; Rev. 7:16-17.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: O Lord, we thank You from our depths that we have been freed from all personal affairs and have been gathered into Your name, sitting here before You and listening to Your speaking.

We truly regard this. We pray that You would again give us utterance, fresh utterance, instant utterance, utterance that can meet Your need today. We pray that You would cause those of us who speak to be able to speak and those of us who listen to be able to listen. O Lord, may none of us consider ourself to have already known and understood. O Lord, cause us to know that we are all like children, for we still know so little of what we ought to know. O Lord, have mercy on us and visit us. May Your Spirit of grace anoint us today, anoint this meeting, anoint every attendant, and anoint every move and action. Furthermore, O Lord, we cannot forget Your enemy. Even though You tolerate him, we still say, Lord, You must restrict him, and You must bind him. Lord, draw the boundary around us by Your prevailing blood and do not allow Your enemy to cross over one step to distract or disturb us. Do preserve us in these two to three days. Moreover, rebuke him and command him to leave us. O Lord, we desire to be free before You to enjoy Your presence. Amen.<h2 class=head1>ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES CONCERNING THE JUDICIAL ASPECT AND THE ORGANIC ASPECT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>In the previous message we saw that God&#8217;s complete salvation is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. This is definitely a great and important matter which may not be easily comprehended by our mind. In the beginning of this message I would like to give a further explanation concerning this matter based on some illustrations found in the holy Scriptures.<h2 class=head2>The Blood of the Lamb and the Flesh of the Lamb</h2><p>Concerning the judicial aspect and the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, there are some illustrations in the Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament, the most evident illustration is the keeping of the Feast of the Passover by the children of Israel. When they kept the Passover, the situation was like this: First, they were enslaved in Egypt for over four hundred years and were unsuccessful in their struggling for freedom; second, like the Egyptians, they were sinful before God, they deserved to die, and they deserved God&#8217;s punishment. Now God sent Moses to lead them out of Egypt, but there were two problems with them that made it difficult for them to get out. First, like the Egyptians, they were under God&#8217;s condemnation and deserved the death penalty. Furthermore, Pharaoh and the Egyptian army would be difficult for them to overcome. Therefore, God gave them the Passover to save them in these two aspects.<p>Exodus 12 shows us the way to keep the Passover. On the fourteenth day of the first month every household of the children of Israel had to kill a lamb. Once the lamb was killed, it was divided into two parts, one part being the blood and the other part, the flesh. God commanded the children of Israel to put the blood of the lamb on the two side posts and on the lintel of their houses, for that night God would send the destroying angel to smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, and when the angel saw the blood on the door of anyone&#8217;s house, he would pass over it. The children of Israel did according to God&#8217;s word, so when the destroyer came to their houses, he passed over them. The function of the blood of the lamb was to deliver them from God&#8217;s condemnation and penalty of death. This is the judicial aspect.<p>God charged the children of Israel not only to sprinkle the blood of the lamb but also to roast the flesh of the lamb and eat it inside the blood-sprinkled house. They had to eat it with their loins girded, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hand; they also had to eat it in haste. I believe that while they ate, they were standing, not sitting. This means that after the eating they had to flee from Egypt. Hence, after they sprinkled the blood of the lamb, the children of Israel also needed to eat the flesh of the lamb hastily. On the judicial side the blood was sprinkled on the door to meet God&#8217;s need; on the organic side the flesh was eaten and received into the children of Israel to meet their need for moving on. The way before them was quite long, at least three days&#8217; journey. Without eating the flesh of the lamb, they could not go even for three hours, needless to say three days. Without eating the flesh of the lamb, they would be overtaken by the Egyptians. Therefore, every household had to eat the flesh of the lamb until they were full that they might be ready to take the journey ahead. This is the organic side.<p>Hence, the Passover in the Old Testament shows us that God&#8217;s salvation has the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect. The redeeming aspect, signified by the blood of the lamb, is according to God&#8217;s judicial requirement; the saving aspect, signified by the flesh of the lamb, is according to God&#8217;s organic provision of life.<h2 class=head2>The Robe and the Calf</h2><p>Next, let us look at an illustration in the New Testament. Luke 15 speaks about a son who left home to wander abroad and became a prodigal son. One day the prodigal son clothed in rags returned home. Although he was still his father&#8217;s son, he appeared outwardly as a prodigal son. When he was still a long way off, his father saw him and ran to embrace and kiss him. Afterward, his father immediately ordered the slaves, saying, &#8220;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him.&#8221; That robe was known to all the household because it had been prepared earlier by the father to be put on his son upon his return. The son had become the prodigal son, and even though he came back to the father&#8217;s house, he still had to put on that robe so that he might look like a son before his father. This is the aspect of redemption. The father had certain qualifications, and to be his son there were certain requirements. When the son left home to wander abroad, he lost his status as a son and became a prodigal son. When the father put that robe upon him, he immediately became a son again. This refers to the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation.<p>However, it is not sufficient merely to be clothed with the robe and become a son. At this time, on the one hand, the son was happy, but on the other hand, he must have said in his heart, &#8220;Father, what I need now is not to be clothed with a robe outside. I am not fed inside. I was feeding on carob pods for several years. Today I come back with an empty stomach. Please hurry and give me some food.&#8221; Perhaps the son was ashamed to say it, but the father went on to say, &#8220;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry.&#8221; At that time the son must have been dancing with joy. After eating the fattened calf, the son was satisfied and no longer hungry. Hence, the robe signifies the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, and the calf signifies the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation.<h2 class=head2>The Lord&#8217;s Blood and the Lord&#8217;s Flesh</h2><p>Once a week we come to the Lord&#8217;s table, and on the table the bread and the cup are displayed. The cup, signifying the blood which the Lord shed for our sins, is for meeting the need of redemption; hence, it is related to the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. The bread, signifying the Lord as the bread of life, is related to the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. In John 6 the Lord said, &#8220;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&#8221; (v. 55). This word was spoken based on the type of the Passover. In the type of the Passover in the Old Testament, the children of Israel sprinkled the blood of the lamb and ate the flesh of the lamb. However, in the fulfillment of the Passover in the New Testament, we drink the Lord&#8217;s blood and eat the Lord&#8217;s flesh. To drink the blood is judicial for redemption; to eat the flesh is organic for the move after receiving redemption. When the Lord established His table before His death, He used the bread and the cup as symbols (Matt. 26:26-28). When we eat the bread and drink the cup, this signifies that we eat the Lord&#8217;s flesh and drink the Lord&#8217;s blood. The total result of these two items is that we receive God as our eternal life, for the Lord said, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&#8221; (John 6:54). Therefore, we eat and drink the Lord in order that we may have Him as our eternal life. Only by the drinking of the blood, which is judicial, and by the eating of the flesh, which is organic, can the goal of God&#8217;s salvation be accomplished.<h2 class=head1>FOUR WAYS OF SPEAKING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN CONCERNING RECEIVING THE ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>Receiving the eternal life is spoken of in four ways in the Gospel of John. First, John 3:16 says, &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life.&#8221; Next, John 3:14-15 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.&#8221; Then John 6:54 says, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life.&#8221; Finally, in a simple way, John 3:36 says, &#8220;He who believes into the Son has eternal life.&#8221; These four portions show us that the purpose of God&#8217;s loving us is that we may have His eternal life; that the Lord was lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent to deal with the old serpent, Satan, for the purpose also that we may have the eternal life of God; that we eat the Lord&#8217;s flesh and drink the Lord&#8217;s blood for us to be redeemed and to enjoy everything that the Lord Jesus has given to us in life-all this is for us to have the eternal life of God; and, finally, that we believe into the Lord in order that we may have the eternal life of God.<p>The eternal life spoken of in the holy Scripture is called by the general Christians the everlasting life. According to their understanding, to receive the everlasting life means that one day we will all go to heaven to enjoy blessings and happiness forever. When I heard this kind of speaking in my youth, I was not satisfied. Gradually, I began to know that the everlasting life is the eternal life, which is the very life of God. This life is the very God Himself. God loves us that we may receive Him as our eternal life. The Lord Jesus died for us on the cross as a serpent and dealt with Satan that we may receive God as our eternal life. He sacrificed His life and shed His blood that we may receive God as our eternal life. Simply speaking, we believe in the Lord that we may receive God as our eternal life.<h2 class=head1>THE FIVE ITEMS OF THE JUDICIAL REDEMPTION AND THE EIGHT ITEMS OF THE ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD&#8217;S COMPLETE SALVATION</h2><p>God is the eternal life, and He desires to come into us to be our life. His coming into us is purposeful. After He comes into us, the first thing He does is to regenerate us. Do not think that God&#8217;s intention is merely to redeem you. Rather, God&#8217;s intention is to regenerate you. Suppose you are not a good person, and I want to change you so that you will be as good as I am. However, regardless of how much I try to change you, you still cannot be like me. What is needed is for me to enter into your being and cause you to be born again with my genes. In this way you will have my life and nature and can really become like me. This is precisely the way that God comes into us to regenerate us with His life and nature that we may have His life and nature. This is regeneration.<p>We all have believed in the Lord Jesus. We all have been saved and have had our sins both forgiven and washed away. Not only so, we have also been justified, reconciled to God, and separated, sanctified. Then, have we been regenerated? We have believed in the Lord, our sins have been forgiven, our sins have been washed away, we have been justified by God, we have been reconciled to God, and we have been separated, sanctified, unto God. All these items are sure. But do we know whether we have been regenerated? If we are sure concerning the aforementioned items, it is simply not possible to say that we have not been regenerated.<p>I believe we all know the five items of the judicial redemption of God&#8217;s salvation which include forgiveness of sins, washing away of sins, justification by God, reconciliation to God, and positional sanctification. But some may not know what regeneration is, nor do they know whether they have received the eternal life. To be regenerated and thereby receive God as our eternal life is the first item of the organic salvation of God&#8217;s complete salvation. In the organic salvation the first thing is for us to be regenerated and receive God&#8217;s eternal life. Following this, we have shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification.<p>To us, these eight points, beginning with regeneration, passing through shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, and conformation, and reaching all the way to glorification, are not easy to understand. We are very knowledgeable concerning all the five items on the judicial side. We know that we are sinful and that when we repent, confess our sins before God, and believe in the Lord, we receive forgiveness of sins and our sins are washed away, we are justified by God that we may be reconciled to Him, and we are sanctified positionally. We know all these things. Hence, some people may say, &#8220;These five things are sufficient for us to go to heaven. God will never condemn us again. He has forgiven us forever, so we can live in peace.&#8221; Therefore, they preach the gospel to others, saying, &#8220;Just be at peace and rejoice by trusting in Jesus. Try to be a good person and try to help others, then one day you will go to heaven.&#8221; They feel that this is good enough and that there is no need to talk about other things. This is the general condition of Christianity today. But the Bible says that this is not sufficient. In addition to the five items, the Bible covers another eight items: regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification.<p>We should not despise the five items on the judicial side, and even more we should not despise the eight items on the organic side. The former group of five items is the base, like the foundation of a house. We need to build the latter group of  eight items on the foundation of the former group of five items. I know that we brothers and sisters in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are very clear concerning the first five items. This shows that we have had adequately clear fellowship concerning the five items as the foundation. Therefore, our burden today is to fellowship concerning the latter eight items that we may have a more thorough knowledge concerning the eight organic items.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION AND SHEPHERDING-THE PROPAGATION AND NOURISHMENT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>In this message we want to see the matters of regeneration and shepherding in the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. God&#8217;s organic salvation begins with regeneration and continues with shepherding. Regeneration is the propagation of God&#8217;s life by the imparting of God&#8217;s life into the believers that they may be regenerated and partake of God&#8217;s life. Shepherding is the nourishment of God&#8217;s life that the regenerated believers may grow and have their existence in the divine life, thus manifesting the function of the divine life in them.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>Regeneration Being the Center of God&#8217;s Complete Salvation and the Commencement of God&#8217;s Salvation in Its Organic Aspect</h2><p>It is neither easy to speak nor easy to understand the truth concerning regeneration as an organic matter. When I first believed in the Lord, I, too, did not know what regeneration was. When I went to ask the Chinese pastors, most of them would say that regeneration means that all the things in the past died like yesterday and all the things henceforth are born like today. One day while I was attending a meeting of the Brethren Assembly, I noticed they had a book entitled A True Explanation of Regeneration. When I saw it I was very happy. I obtained the book and finished reading it quickly. Eventually, I found out that the book did not give a clear explanation of regeneration. Later, I read a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, in which he said that regeneration is to have the life of God in addition to our natural life. When I read it I was greatly enlightened within. From that time on, I have become more and more enlightened. From my depths I thoroughly realize that God has His heart&#8217;s desire, His good pleasure, that is, to obtain a group of people and to make them the same as He, with His image without and His life and nature within.<h2 class=head3>To Regenerate and Re-create the Believers in Their Spirit through the Spirit of God</h2><p>How does God achieve this? It is through His Spirit. After we repented and believed in the Lord, our sins were forgiven and we were reconciled to God. Then this God who loves us and who is the life-giving Spirit comes into us to regenerate our spirit. John 3 refers to Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. He respectfully addressed the Lord Jesus as One who had come from God as a teacher to Israel, and he therefore came to get some advice from Him. However, the Lord Jesus said to him, &#8220;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; (v. 3). Nicodemus did not understand the meaning of regeneration. He thought that regeneration was for a man to enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born. So he said to the Lord Jesus, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born, can he?&#8221; (v. 4). However, the regeneration which the Lord Jesus referred to was for one to be born of water (that is, death) and the Spirit (that is, life) (v. 5). Then the Lord went on to say, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (v. 6). The first Spirit is the divine Spirit, referring to God. God is Spirit. When we are born of Him, we are born of the Spirit and eventually, we are spirit, the second spirit referred to in John 3:6. This is to be regenerated.<h2 class=head3>Through God&#8217;s Word of Life</h2><p>First Peter 1:23 says, &#8220;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&#8221; This shows us that regeneration is through God&#8217;s word of life. A great majority of the regenerated ones were regenerated through the word of God. The word of God as a gene enters into us and operates in us. In this way we were regenerated.<h2 class=head3>For the Believers to Have the Spiritual Life of God</h2><p>John 1:12-13 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; This portion tells us that the way to be regenerated is to receive the Lord Jesus by believing into Him. He is the Word from God (1:1), and He is also the light from God (v. 9). When we receive Him, we have the authority to become children of God. This authority is nothing other than the life of God. God gives us His life as our authority that we may become children of God. Hence, we are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. This is regeneration, which is a great matter.<p>Therefore, we may say that regeneration is the center of God&#8217;s complete salvation and the commencement of God&#8217;s salvation in its organic aspect. It is God Himself as the Spirit coming into our spirit to make us alive. In other words, we are regenerated, made alive, in our spirit by the Spirit of God. This is regeneration.<p>This indeed is our experience. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were so confused about everything that we even did not know what being a man was all about. However, after we were saved, we became clear in our spirit. This is the Spirit of God coming into our spirit to enliven it and open our understanding so that we begin to know what God is all about, what the universe is all about, and what we ourselves are all about. Then we know that this God who regenerated us dwells in our spirit.<p>When I saw that I, one who had been regenerated of God, had God dwelling in me, I was so excited that I almost wanted to run to the street and shout, &#8220;Friends, don&#8217;t touch me. I can&#8217;t be touched. I have God in me.&#8221; Some may say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this person crazy?&#8221; Yes, we all should be crazy for having God in us. By seeing that we have God in us, we can give up what we loved and what we were not able to give up in the past. We have been made alive in our spirit by the Spirit of God; He has put His genes in us that we may have His life and nature.<p>Through regeneration the believers have the spiritual life of God in addition to their natural life (John 3:15). The spiritual life of God is divine and eternal (v. 36). Such a divine life is the basis and means of the believers&#8217; spiritual life and living. Spiritually, all of our living is based upon the divine life of God in us.<h2 class=head2>Such a Regeneration Being a Washing in God&#8217;s Salvation, and This Kind of Washing Being a Great Renewing of the Believers by God&#8217;s Salvation</h2><p>Titus 3:5 says, &#8220;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This verse refers to God&#8217;s salvation. God saves us according to His mercy through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Regeneration is a great washing in us. Regeneration washes away not only our sins but also all our natural human elements until everything of our old man will be thoroughly purged away.<p>Among those who are present here, there are some Hakka people, and there are also some from Shantung. Whether it is a Hakka from southern China or a native of Shantung from northern China, neither can be changed. However, God has chosen us and also regenerated us. Regeneration is God coming into us, and then He washes us layer after layer. When He comes into us, immediately He becomes our life. We all know that every kind of life has its taste. The cat life has its taste, the dog life has its taste, and so does the horse life, the cow life, the goat life, etc. The Hakkas have their taste, and the Shantung people also have their taste. All our taste comes from our five senses-the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, and the sense of touch. The Hakkas have the Hakka insight that comes from their sense of sight, and they have the Hakka way of speaking that comes from their sense of hearing. Furthermore, the Hakkas have the Hakka way of life. All the things that come in through the five senses constitute our taste. However, one day the Triune God came in to be our life. When we have Him as our life, our inner taste is changed. This is the organic work of God.<p>Let me speak a little about my experience. I was saved at the age of nineteen. Before that time, I was a genuine Shantung native with my entire being filled with the Shantung flavor. My favorite pastimes were watching Peking opera and playing soccer, with the latter as my greatest enjoyment. On Sundays a few of us would play soccer from seven or eight o&#8217;clock in the morning until six or seven o&#8217;clock in the evening. Not only so, if I did not watch the Peking operas, I would feel very unsatisfied. My mother simply had no way to deal with me. From our youth she brought us to the Sunday Christian service, and she also promised that as long as we would go to the service, she would give us meat and other good food to eat. In spite of this, I still would not go. I just wanted to play soccer. As long as I could play soccer, I could forget about sleep and meals.<p>One day Miss Peace Wang came to my hometown to preach the gospel. When I heard the news, I went out of curiosity to listen to her preaching. That afternoon she preached a message concerning how Satan, like the Pharaoh of Egypt, detains people in his system. Her preaching was so full of power that when I heard the message, I was awakened suddenly and said to myself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to follow Satan; rather, I want God.&#8221; That afternoon after listening to the preaching of the gospel, I came out of the chapel, and on my way home, as I was standing on the street, I lifted up my head and spoke to heaven, saying, &#8220;O God, I don&#8217;t want this world anymore. From now on, even if You give me the whole world, I don&#8217;t want it. I just want You. From now on, I just want to bring the Bible with me to preach the gospel in the villages. Even if I have to drink the water from the mountains and eat the roots of the trees, I am willing.&#8221; I prayed such a prayer. From that time on, I was freed from the Peking operas. But I still considered within myself that playing soccer was good for my health and was not harmful, so there was nothing wrong with it. Therefore, on Sundays, I would go to the church service in the morning, and then in the afternoon I would go to play soccer. One day, I was again on the playground playing ball with others. At one point while I was standing there, the ball rolled toward me and stopped right in front of my feet. Everyone was watching to see how I would kick the ball, and I also displayed a certain posture for kicking. Eventually, when I was about to kick, my foot could not function and I simply could not continue playing. So I turned around and left the playground. My friends asked me, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Nothing.&#8221; From that time on, I never played soccer again. This is my experience of the washing of regeneration, and it has been washing in me for seventy years. Up to this day I still sense that I have two or three layers of my old Shantung nature that remain to be washed away. The washing is still going on.<p>Let us give another illustration. Thirty years ago I was here in the United States releasing the word of God. At that time many hippies came to listen to my speaking. Some of them wore a headband, and some had long beards and dark countenances. Among them there was one who resembled John the Baptist. He used to go to the campuses shouting, &#8220;Repent!&#8221; He had a big beard and was very husky, so he looked quite intimidating. He also came to our meetings. He was barefoot, and he sat in front of me swinging his feet. Eventually, after a few days, his long beard was gone. After another few days, he came in a pair of sandals. However, his five toes were still exposed. After a few more days, he put on a pair of shoes. When we look at him today standing here, we cannot imagine that he is an ex-hippie. I did not advise him to change himself. However, after he heard the word of God, the life-giving Spirit began to wash him from within. His insight changed, his sense of hearing changed, and his taste changed. This is the washing of regeneration.<p>Hence, regeneration is a washing in God&#8217;s salvation (Titus 3:5). Such a washing is a great renewing of the believers by God&#8217;s salvation to enable them to get rid of all that is of their natural life and the old creation and become God&#8217;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). The washing of regeneration begins with our regeneration and continues with the renewing of the Spirit, both of which are on the aspect of the organic salvation and are matters of life. In the washing of regeneration there is the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Following the washing of regeneration, the Holy Spirit continues to work within us to re-create us that we may become a new creation, thus making us renewed. Finally, this renewing enables us to get rid of all that is of our natural life and the old creation and become God&#8217;s new creation.<h2 class=head1>SHEPHERDING</h2><h2 class=head2>The Second Step of the Triune God&#8217;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>Now we will go on to see the shepherding in God&#8217;s organic salvation. After the believers are regenerated and receive God as their eternal life, they still need to receive the shepherding in God&#8217;s life. In His organic salvation God the Father of the Divine Trinity first regenerates us by God the Spirit and then shepherds us in God the Son as our Shepherd that we may grow and exist in His life for eternity. This is the second step in the organic salvation of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>Shepherding Including Feeding</h2><p>Shepherding includes feeding, as the nursing mother feeds the baby for the baby to grow, as mentioned in 1 Peter 2:2. In this way the Lord commissioned Peter to feed His lambs and shepherd His flock on His behalf (John 21:15-17). He also raised up those such as Peter to be His deputy shepherds to feed His lambs and shepherd His flock (Eph. 4:11; 1 Pet. 5:1-4).<p>First Peter 2:2 says, &#8220;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word....&#8221; I recall my experience and it is exactly so. I loved to read books, and I did so with diligence. When I was saved, I began to love the Bible and enjoyed reading the word of God. Whenever I read it, I was enlightened and sensed its incomparable sweetness. At that time I was not yet married. I loved the Bible to such an extent that every night after praying on my knees by my bed, I still would not put the Bible down. Rather, I would take the Bible with me to bed and place it by the pillow. After I read it again for a short while under the lamp, I felt so sweet. When I woke up in the morning, I would quickly reach for the Bible and read it. Of course, as I look back, I admit that was a grace given to me by God. By loving the Bible and longing for the milk in the word, I received the Lord&#8217;s feeding and shepherding.<p>Furthermore, in Song of Songs the Lord instructs His lover to go forth on the footsteps of His flock and be at the place where He pastures His sheep (S.S. 1:7-8). Later, He also pastures His flock among the lilies, that is, among those who seek the Lord and who live a life of trusting in God with a pure heart (2:16; 6:3).<h2 class=head2>The Lord Being the Life and the Good Shepherd</h2><p>The Gospel of John tells us not only that the Lord is the life (11:25; 14:6) but also that the Lord is the good Shepherd who came that we might have life and have it more abundantly (10:10-11). He Himself is also our pasture for us to eat freely of Him and be nourished by Him (10:9).<h2 class=head2>Forming the Jewish Believers and the Gentile Believers into One Flock under His Shepherding</h2><p>Furthermore, the Gospel of John tells us that the Lord as the good Shepherd would lay down His life to form the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one flock under the shepherding of Himself as the one Shepherd (10:14-16).<h2 class=head2>The Lord Being the Chief Shepherd and the Great Shepherd</h2><p>The believers throughout the generations have been under the shepherding of the Lord as the good Shepherd (1 Pet. 2:25). As the Chief Shepherd (5:4) and the great Shepherd of God&#8217;s flock (Heb. 13:20), He will shepherd us for eternity as the Lamb of God and guide us to springs of waters of life for us to have eternal satisfaction, without thirst or hunger (Rev. 7:16-17). By this He accomplishes a great part of God&#8217;s organic salvation.<p>We all were regenerated and are under the shepherding of the Lord as the good Shepherd. Thus, we partake of God&#8217;s life and are nourished and grow unto maturity in it (Eph. 4:13b; Col. 1:28), manifesting the function of God&#8217;s life in us for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal economy and the achievement of God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION AND RENEWING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 15:16; 8:2; 6:19, 22; Eph. 1:4; Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19; Rom. 12:2a</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the dispositional sanctification in the divine nature and in the Spirit&#8217;s renewing of the believers&#8217; mind.</li><li>Dispositional sanctification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Dispositional sanctification being for the believers to be sanctified in their disposition that they may partake of the holy nature of God and be one with Him in this attribute of His-Rom. 15:16.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Through the sanctifying work in the believers by the Spirit of life-Rom. 8:2.</li>		<li>With the element of the life of God as the material.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>This aspect of sanctification implying transformation-Rom. 6:19, 22.</li>	<li>This being the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose in choosing the believers-Eph. 1:4.</li>	<li>Both the positional sanctification in the judicial aspect and the dispositional sanctification in the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation being ultimately manifested in the New Jerusalem for it to become the holy city-Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19.</li>	</ol></li><li>Renewing:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers are spontaneously renewed in their spiritual life when they are sanctified dispositionally by the Holy Spirit.</li>	<li>Requiring the believers not to be fashioned according to this age, but to be transformed by the renewing of their mind-Rom. 12:2a.</li>	<li>To be renewed in the mind is to get rid of all the old concepts concerning the things of the human life and be made new again by the teaching of the holy Scriptures and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</li>	<li>Such a renewing of the mind issuing in the transformation of the believers in their spiritual life.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the previous two messages we referred to the two aspects of God&#8217;s complete salvation, the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. We also covered the first two items of the organic aspect, regeneration and shepherding. In this message we will go on to another two items: dispositional sanctification and renewing.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BEING GOD&#8217;S WORK IN BOTH THE JUDICIAL ASPECT AND THE ORGANIC ASPECT</h2><p>First of all, we want to see that the contents of the New Testament are God&#8217;s work in both the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. In God&#8217;s complete salvation, the judicial work was accomplished in only thirty-three and a half years, from the Lord&#8217;s incarnation to His becoming the life-giving Spirit in resurrection as the incarnated One. The Gospel of John begins in chapter one by saying that in the beginning was the Word and the Word became flesh (vv. 1, 14), and it concludes in chapter twenty (chapter twenty-one being an appendix) by telling us that the Lord resurrected as the Spirit (v. 22). In between it tells us how the incarnated Jesus passed through all kinds of hardships on earth, lived a life under the shadow of the cross, and eventually went to the cross to die there. Then through His death He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This is the content of the Gospels. Following this, the book of Acts gives a record of the apostles preaching the judicial work accomplished by the Lord in thirty-three and a half years. People in different places heard and believed in what the apostles preached, issuing in the churches. Then the churches constitute the Body of Christ organically and will ultimately consummate the New Jerusalem. After the book of Acts, there are the twenty-two Epistles, from Romans to Revelation, all of which speak concerning the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, that is, concerning regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification.<p>In brief, of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, the first four Gospels unveil the history, speaking in particular concerning the Lord Jesus; the fifth book, Acts, tells us how this Jesus was announced to different places. This announcing was greatly effective and it brought in the churches, issuing in the Body of Christ and ultimately consummating the New Jerusalem. Following Acts, the twenty-two Epistles cover particularly the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem. In what way? By speaking concerning regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification. These items, from regeneration to glorification, are for the producing of the church, the Body of Christ, and eventually the consummating of the New Jerusalem. Hence, these eight items are matters in between the church and the New Jerusalem. Therefore, the New Testament covers the work of Christ in two periods. The first period was His thirty-three and a half years on earth, and in this period all of God&#8217;s work was judicial and was accomplished by the Lord Jesus. The second period is from the time after His resurrection to the present day through eternity, and in this period all of God&#8217;s work is organic and is being carried out by the Spirit. Therefore, Philippians 1:19 refers to &#8220;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God, has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply. This bountiful supply involves the judicial work of the first section and the organic work of the second section.<p>The first item of the organic work of God is regeneration, which is to bring the Triune God into man. Regeneration means that Christ is received by man and enters into man. This Christ who enters into those who receive Him is the embodiment of the Father. Therefore, when He comes in, the Father also comes in. Not only so, the realization, the reality, of Christ is the Spirit. Therefore, when Christ comes in, not only both the Father and the Son come in, but the Spirit also comes in. The three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-all come in and abide in the regenerated ones, become one spirit with the believers, and are joined with them as one. This is an exceedingly great matter in the universe. Therefore, D. L. Moody, the founder of the Moody Bible Institute and a great evangelist in America in the last century, said that regeneration is the greatest miracle in the universe.<p>If we do not have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit abiding in us to be constituted with us as an organism, there can be no church and no Body of Christ. Therefore, in Ephesians 4 Paul referred to one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father (vv. 4-6). This one God and Father Himself has an aspect of three-He is over all and through all and in all (v. 6). Not only is the Father here, but also the Son and the Spirit are here. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit and the redeemed, regenerated, shepherded, sanctified, renewed, transformed, built-up, conformed, and glorified people are constituted together to become an organism, that is, the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY</h2><p>However, the view of Christianity today concerning the Bible is too low. The Lutherans do not put much emphasis on the growth in life and transformation. They consider that once a person believes in the Lord, he is justified, but they do not pay much attention to the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. Likewise, proponents of the reformed theology also do not care for the matters of growth in life and transformation, which they consider too troublesome. Rather, they think that once a person believes in the Lord, he receives a salvation that is eternally secured. God has chosen us once in eternity and that is sufficient and will never change. Their teaching comes short of the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures. We cannot say that there is nothing more after God&#8217;s choosing. Ephesians 1:4 indeed says that we were chosen. But Ephesians does not have only this one verse. Ephesians 1 has many more verses telling us that there are still many things after God&#8217;s choosing. Thus, we simply cannot say that God&#8217;s choosing is sufficient. People in the Pentecostal movement also neglect the matters of growth in life and transformation. They consider that it is more important to speak in tongues and that a person cannot be saved without speaking in tongues.<p>This is the condition of today&#8217;s Christianity. They do not know the organic matters in God&#8217;s salvation. Not only so, many people in Christianity do not know that the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit. They even do not know what the Spirit is, nor do they know that there is a spirit in man. They consider the spirit and the soul as one and synonymous. Not only so, they mix up the heart, the soul, and the spirit, considering them synonymous.<p>This condition of Christianity today is incurable. All we can do is wait for the Lord to come back. According to Revelation 17, when the Lord comes back, the first thing He will do is burn the Catholic Church with fire (v. 16); next, He will command the angels to bind into bundles all the false Christians, the tares, in Christianity and cast them into the lake of fire (Matt. 13:30, 41-42). Third, He will gather all the genuinely saved ones to His judgment seat; there He will judge them to see whose living and work are gold, silver, and precious stones and whose living and work are wood, grass, and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12-15; 4:4-5; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12). If the living and work are wood, grass, and stubble, the Lord will burn these things with fire. As a result, only a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones will remain. The Lord has shown me these truths after my studying of the Word for seventy years. However, I feel so pained when I look at the condition of today&#8217;s Christianity. Without the Lord&#8217;s mercy, the Lord&#8217;s recovery may have two kinds of conditions. One condition is to be like that of Sardis, that is, living in name but dead in reality (Rev. 3:1). The other condition is to be like that of Laodicea, that is, neither hot nor cold (v. 16). Being living in name and yet dead and being neither hot nor cold were our condition several years ago. That is why in 1984 I went to Taiwan to study the Lord&#8217;s new way for His recovery to go on. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, generally speaking, we have come out of the conditions of Sardis and Laodicea. But we need to be humble lest some fall into such conditions.<h2 class=head1>SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Now we will go on to see the sanctification in the divine nature and the Spirit&#8217;s renewing of the believers.<h2 class=head2>Positional Sanctification Belonging to the Judicial Aspect of God&#8217;s Salvation</h2><p>First, we must know the difference between positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification. The former belongs to the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, whereas the latter belongs to the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation.<p>Before we were saved, we were altogether in the world. After we were saved and regenerated, the Lord completely separated us to make us holy. This is positional sanctification for the believers to be separated out of the world and made holy unto God (1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 1:7). As mentioned in Matthew 23, when the gold is placed in the market, it is something common, but when it is placed in the temple, it is sanctified (v. 17). This kind of sanctification does not change at all the inward disposition; it changes only the outward position. Every regenerated person more or less has this kind of experience. Immediately after we were saved, we simply did not want to mingle with those in the world; we had been separated from them. This is positional sanctification, separation. This positional sanctification is through the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 10:29; 13:12) for the believers to become God&#8217;s peculiar people (1 Pet. 2:9-10 and notes).<h2 class=head2>Dispositional Sanctification Being for the Believers to Be Sanctified in Their Disposition That They May Partake of God&#8217;s Holy Nature</h2><p>However, it is not sufficient to be separated and made holy unto God positionally. After we are sanctified positionally and reconciled to God, as we begin to pursue in life, we will sense something within us which is not our disposition but God&#8217;s nature. This nature within us deals thoroughly with our natural disposition, our peculiar disposition, and our temperament so that the divine nature becomes our disposition. This is to sanctify the believers dispositionally that they may partake of God&#8217;s holy nature and be one with God in this attribute of His (Rom. 15:16). This kind of sanctification uses the element of God&#8217;s life as the material and is carried out through the sanctifying work in the believers by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).<p>This is exactly my experience. After I was saved, because I loved the Lord and was growing in life, God&#8217;s holy nature continually carried out a sanctifying work in me. When I went to the department stores, I looked at one item, yet I could not wear it; I looked at another item and I could not use it. When I first changed to wearing Western clothes, buying neckties was a big problem. Some neckties were too wide, others were too narrow, and still others were too fancy. Today my neckties are neither too wide nor too narrow nor too fancy. This is because when I go to buy a necktie, there is a nature within me that wants me to buy this kind of necktie. Brothers, the yardstick for our living and our clothing is the divine nature within us. This divine nature of God within us is the yardstick for our living. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #841 says, &#8220;Thou art all my life, Lord,/In me Thou dost live;/With Thee all God&#8217;s fulness/Thou to me dost give./By Thy holy nature/I am sanctified,/By Thy resurrection,/Vict&#8217;ry is supplied.&#8221; By the Lord&#8217;s holy nature we are sanctified. This kind of sanctification is not outward but inward. Therefore, we do not say that this is positional sanctification; rather, we say that it is dispositional sanctification.<p>The yardstick for our living is not the outward regulations or laws but the inward divine nature. In some parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio there is a Christian sect with many established criteria for not loving the world, mainly concerning the believers&#8217; wearing of clothes or hats. They even limit the women&#8217;s clothing to only three colors: white, black, and dark blue. They also specify that the men should wear hats with a broad brim. Some fashionable people did not like hats with a broad brim, so they secretly made their hat with a narrower brim. But their pastor condemned the narrow brim as worldliness. Eventually, some of them kept two kinds of hats in their home, one with a broad brim and another with a narrow brim. When the pastor came, they wore the one with a broad brim, and after the pastor left, they put on the one with a narrow brim.<p>Brothers and sisters, do we regulate ourselves with outward regulations? Do we live and walk according to the holy nature of God or according to outward regulations? Today we do not need these outward regulations; we need only God&#8217;s holy nature, which is able to make us holy. For example, concerning women&#8217;s apparel, the Bible gives us only a word saying that women should adorn themselves in proper clothing (1 Tim. 2:9). But what kind of clothing is considered proper? The divine nature within you will tell you. This is dispositional sanctification; this is the organic work which Christ as the Spirit is carrying out in us. It is not something judicial; it is something altogether organic. This aspect of sanctification implies transformation (Rom. 6:19, 22) for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose in choosing the believers (Eph. 1:4). Eventually, both the positional sanctification in the judicial aspect and the dispositional sanctification in the organic aspect of God&#8217;s complete salvation will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem for it to become the holy city (Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19).<h2 class=head1>RENEWING</h2><h2 class=head2>The Believers Are Spontaneously Renewed in Their Spiritual Life When They Are Sanctified by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Now we will go on to see the renewing in the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. In the preceding message we saw that regeneration is to have God as our life. It is a matter in the life of God. After regeneration we pass through shepherding, and then we have the dispositional sanctification, which is a matter in the nature of God. Not only do we need to be regenerated in life, but we also need to be sanctified in our disposition. No human disposition is good; only the nature of God is holy. When we are saved, the element of God&#8217;s holy nature comes into us; this holy nature begins to work in us to sanctify us dispositionally. Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us before the foundation of the world to be holy. This shows us that to be holy is the purpose of God&#8217;s choosing. To be holy is to have God&#8217;s nature, whereas to have the sonship, in verse 5, is to have God&#8217;s life. Through regeneration we have the life of God, and through sanctification our disposition is changed. When the believers are sanctified dispositionally, they are spontaneously renewed in their spiritual life.<h2 class=head2>Not Being Fashioned according to This Age, but Being Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind</h2><p>Romans 12:2a says, &#8220;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; We should not be fashioned according to this age. This means that we should not be fashionable. Rather, we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind. Some say that this kind of renewing is the so-called teaching by Confucius and Mencius that &#8220;the principle of the Great Learning is to develop the bright virtue and to renew the people&#8221; and that &#8220;if you can renew yourself for one day, then let there be daily renewing.&#8221; However, the renewing taught in the Bible is not the same as the renewing taught in the books of Confucius and Mencius. The renewing taught by Confucius and Mencius is merely to improve oneself or adjust oneself daily. In contrast, the renewing taught by the Scriptures is the renewing of the mind; it is altogether a matter related to the mind. The mind is our mentality, our philosophy, our religious concepts, our views concerning people and things, etc. We need to be renewed mainly in our mind.<p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; The preceding verse says to put off the old man (v. 22), the succeeding verse says to put on the new man (v. 24), and the verse in the middle says to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The spirit of our mind is the regenerated spirit mingled with the Spirit of God spreading into our mind to exercise control over it. In this way our mind is renewed. Furthermore, Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;...the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; This also shows us the importance of our mind. Our mind can be renewed only by our setting it on the spirit.<p>Not only so, the New Testament teaches us to have the mind in us which was also in Christ Jesus (Phil. 2:5). This is equivalent to taking the mind of Christ Jesus as our mind. By regeneration we have the life of God, by sanctification we partake of the nature of God, and by renewing we have a change in our mind.<p>We who have been separated, sanctified, unto God should not be assimilated by the world. Rather, we should care for the transformation by the renewing of our mind which the Lord Spirit is carrying out by moving and working in us through the divine life and the divine nature. I saw a brother wearing a pair of shoes adorned with tassels, but now I notice that he is wearing another pair of shoes without any adornment. This is because his mind has been renewed; he is no longer fashioned according to this age. I am happy because we are not those who daily speak about living Christ yet who wear shoes with tassels. Likewise, the sisters should not, on the one hand, speak about loving the Lord, and on the other hand, apply lipstick heavily. I do know that if the sisters will say more, &#8220;O Lord, I love You,&#8221; the lipstick they apply will become less and less daily and will eventually disappear. This is because their mind will be renewed and transformed.<h2 class=head2>To Be Renewed in the Mind Being to Get Rid of All the Old Concepts concerning the Things of the Human Life and Be Made New Again by the Teaching of the Holy Scriptures and the Enlightening of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>How can our mind be renewed that our whole being may be renewed? The way of renewing lies in prayer and in reading the Scriptures, because for us to be renewed in our mind is for us to get rid of all our old concepts concerning the things of the human life and be made new again by the teaching of the holy Scriptures and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. When you read the Bible and become familiar with it, the Holy Spirit will enlighten you and guide you. When the Holy Spirit comes to enlighten you while you thus pray and read the Word day by day, the mind in you is being changed from the old to the new. Your view is different and your being is renewed.<h2 class=head2>Such a Renewing of the Mind Issuing in the Transformation of the Believers in Their Spiritual Life</h2><p>Such a renewing of the mind issues in the transformation of the believers in their spiritual life. Titus 3:5 refers to the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The washing of regeneration washes away our old life; following this, the renewing of the Holy Spirit changes our mind. When our mind is renewed, our whole being is transformed. This is to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things in the old nature of our old man, whereas the renewing of the Holy Spirit dispenses the new things, the divine essence of the new man, into our being. Through this we turn from the old condition in which we were into a completely new condition, from the state of the old creation into the state of the new creation.<p>Today our problem is due mostly to our mind. Brother Nee said that some people are afraid of others stealing their wallet from their pocket, so they are always feeling in their pocket for their wallet; he said that this is an indication that they have mentally stolen from others. This is to have a disordered mind. Sometimes when someone has something wrong in his mind, he begins to have wild imaginations. A wife may begin to weep when she indulges in wild imaginations. All these matters are related to the mind. God Himself has become our life, He is changing our disposition, and He is also renewing our mind. Thus, we can have the proper concepts and can pursue Christ in a proper way. Often when some came to me to debate about some biblical questions, I said, &#8220;It is impossible for your kind of mind to understand the Bible, and I won&#8217;t argue with you. Your mind is a mind that simply cannot understand the Bible.&#8221; Our disposition needs to be sanctified so that we may partake of God&#8217;s holy nature; our mind also needs to be renewed so that we may be transformed in our spiritual life. This is the saving that God renders to us in the organic aspect of His salvation.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>TRANSFORMATION AND BUILDING UP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:16, 18; 4:16; Matt. 16:13-18; John 1:51; 2:16-22; 14:23, 2; Rom. 12:3-5; 1 Cor. 1:10-13; 3:9-15; Gal. 6:14-15; Eph. 3:17; 4:4-6, 11-16; Rev. 3:12-13; 4:3a; 21:2, 10-23; 22:1-5</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the metabolism in the divine life and in the joining and knitting in the building up.</li><li>Transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Transformation being not an outward change or correction, but the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers.</li>	<li>By the believers turning to the Lord and thereby removing the various kinds of veils of their old concepts-2 Cor. 3:16.</li>	<li>Even more, by the believers, with an unveiled face, beholding the Lord and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord-2 Cor. 3:18.</li>	<li>Thus they are being transformed into the same image as the Lord from one level of glory to another level of glory for the Lord&#8217;s expression.</li>	<li>Even as from the Lord Spirit, that is, Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</li>	<li>This requiring the believers&#8217; outer man to be decaying (to be consumed) that their inner man may be renewed day by day-2 Cor. 4:16.</li>	</ol></li><li>Building up:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Building up is the God-men&#8217;s being joined and knit together with other God-men in the divine life by their growth in the divine life.</li>	<li>Brought forth through the joining and knitting by the transforming Spirit-Eph. 4:15-16.</li>	<li>The building up of the Body of Christ in the New Testament is this kind of building up by being joined and knit together in the divine life, and its purpose is to consummate the building of the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head1>THE THREE STAGES OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>From Eternity Past into Time</h2><p>We all know that the Lord Jesus as the eternal God is from eternity to eternity, yet with Him there is an aspect of three stages. The first of the three stages is from eternity past to the time of creation. He created the heavens, the earth, and man. The entire universe was created by Him. In His creation He made man the center. In eternity past, He was merely the only begotten Son of God, who is the same as God and is the Second in the Divine Trinity. At the time of creation, He came out of eternity and entered into time.<h2 class=head2>Coming with Divinity and Entering into Humanity, Living on Earth for Thirty-three and a Half Years, and Dying on the Cross for the Accomplishment of the Judicial Aspect of God&#8217;s Salvation</h2><p>Although He had come out of eternity, He had not yet come with His divinity into humanity. He came out of eternity to enter into time, but He did not come with His divinity to enter into humanity. In His creation, He created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26) that He might attain His purpose. However, man fell, and Jehovah came to judge the fallen man. In His judgment, He spoke a prophecy with a promise, that is, that the seed of woman would bruise the serpent&#8217;s head (3:15). At that time Adam and Eve could not do anything, even though they hated the serpent. Suddenly they heard that the seed of woman would come and would bruise the head of the serpent, so they were very excited. However, while the bruising of the serpent&#8217;s head by the seed of woman was to deal with Satan, man still had the problem of sin before God. For this reason, God killed a sacrifice and made coats with the skin of the sacrifice for Adam and Eve to put on (v. 21). Before they put on the skin, both of them were naked (v. 7), without any covering before God. After God provided them with the coats of skin, they were redeemed and covered. Furthermore, God would come personally to become the seed of woman to destroy Satan.<p>Hence, four thousand years after that prophecy with a promise was spoken, God came personally. After four thousand years, that is, two thousand years ago, He came not only from eternity into time but also with divinity into humanity. Now He is not only in time but also in humanity. He as God in eternity was incarnated. John 1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....the Word became flesh&#8221; (vv. 1, 14). At that time, the God-created man was fallen and had become flesh already. Genesis 6:3 says, &#8220;And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh...&#8221; (ASV). Since man had become flesh and God would have nothing to do with the flesh, the Holy Spirit would no longer have any contact with man.<p>This God is the Word becoming flesh, but having only its form, without its reality. Romans 8:3 says that He had &#8220;the likeness of the flesh of sin.&#8221; He had only the likeness, like the bronze serpent which was lifted up on the pole having only the serpent&#8217;s form but without the serpent&#8217;s poison (Num. 21:4-9; John 3:14). This was the eternal God entering into the flesh. He was in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years. This is His second stage. The first stage is in eternity, and the second stage is in the flesh until He was on the cross, saying, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; (John 19:30). On the cross He flowed forth blood and water (v. 34). Blood is for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s redemption in the judicial aspect; water is for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s salvation in the organic aspect.<p>The Lord Jesus was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years to accomplish the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, fulfilling all that God had required according to His righteousness. What He did in His living of thirty-three and a half years was to accomplish the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. He did nothing according to His own will; everything He did was in subjection to the Father (John 5:19, 30; 8:28) through the end when He went to die on the cross. At that time, He knew that it would be a great suffering, so in Gethsemane He prayed and conferred with God, saying, &#8220;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will&#8221; (Matt. 26:39). This is altogether on the judicial side. Eventually, He went to the cross, and there He cried out with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; (27:46). We must remember that in John 8:29 the Lord said, &#8220;He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone.&#8221; The Father was always with the Son and had not left the Son to be by Himself alone. However, for a short period of time on the cross He asked God why He forsook Him. God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners (1 Pet. 3:18)-He bore our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6) and was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21). Christ accomplished all of this in the flesh. This is the second stage.<h2 class=head2>Becoming the Life-giving Spirit through His Resurrection from the Dead for the Fulfillment of the Organic Aspect of God&#8217;s Salvation</h2><p>At the very moment that the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood flowed forth, and with the blood, water also flowed forth. Now both are flowing on. Blood is for the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, whereas water is for the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. When the Holy Spirit moved us, we repented, confessed our sins, and received forgiveness. This forgiveness is based on the judicial aspect, signified by the redeeming blood. However, we still need the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, signified by the water which flowed forth with the blood, that we may attain the eternal purpose of God in us. Blood is for redemption; water is for life dispensing. Through His resurrection from the dead the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and as such He dispenses His life into the redeemed ones for the fulfillment of the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. This is the third stage.<p>Hymn #450 [in the Chinese hymnal] says, &#8220;Spirit begets spirit, and spirit worships Spirit/Thus I am filled with the Spirit;/The Spirit becomes the word with abundant life/ Flowing forth rivers of living water.&#8221; &#8220;Spirit begets spirit&#8221; means that God is Spirit and we have to be born of Him in our spirit that we may be regenerated. Furthermore, since God is Spirit, we must worship Him with our spirit. In this way we will be filled with the Spirit. Moreover, the Spirit becomes the word with abundant life flowing forth rivers of living water. This is the conclusion of the entire Bible-a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1).<p>God&#8217;s salvation in its judicial aspect required only thirty-three and a half years for its accomplishment, but the organic aspect is endless. The judicial aspect is very simple, consisting of only five items: forgiveness of sins, washing away of sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and positional sanctification. However, the organic aspect comprises eight items-regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification-which need to be defined with twenty-two Epistles from Romans to Revelation. The Lord Jesus needs eternity to accomplish His organic work, and the apostles needed twenty-two books to define it.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>In the preceding messages we saw God&#8217;s organic salvation in regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, and renewing. In this message we will go on to see transformation and building up.<h2 class=head2>Transformation Being the Metabolic Function of the Life of God in the Believers</h2><p>Transformation is not an outward change or correction but the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers. Transformation is not to make some corrections from without; it is the function of metabolism from within and is manifested without. This is expressed in a line of the new hymn for this conference: &#8220;Manifesting the metabolism in life.&#8221;<p>Suppose a person is undernourished and appears thin and sickly. He cannot improve by merely applying some powder to his face. Rather, he needs to be supplemented with nutrition; then his physical condition will improve and his facial color will spontaneously become rosy. Luke 15 tells us that when the prodigal son returned home, he had a robe put on him for his covering, yet he still appeared thin and sickly. Merely to have the robe was not sufficient; he still needed to eat the fattened calf for several days. When metabolism began to work in him, he would naturally become strong and his facial color would look pretty. Thus, the beauty that comes by applying powder is not genuine beauty; only that which is expressed outwardly through the inward metabolism is genuine health and real beauty.<p>If the believers are willing to grow in the divine life, the element of the divine life will increase in them and bring forth a metabolic change. Thus, their inward disposition will be transformed, and their outward image will also be transformed to be the same as the image of the Lord. This is not moral cultivation by examining oneself and mending one&#8217;s ways as taught by Confucianism in China. That is man&#8217;s own moral cultivation. When we are transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding Him, this is not the result of our self-cultivation, but it is the Lord Spirit, the life-giving Spirit whom the Lord Christ became in His resurrection, who moves within us to bring forth a metabolic change through the increase of the element of the divine life in us (2 Cor. 3:18). This is altogether a transformation brought forth by the moving and working of the Lord Spirit and the divine life within us.<h2 class=head2>The Believers Being Transformed into the Image of the Lord by Turning to the Lord and Beholding Him with an Unveiled Face</h2><p>If we desire to have this kind of transformation, we must first remove the various kinds of veils of our old concepts by turning to the Lord (2 Cor. 3:16) and by beholding Him with an unveiled face and reflecting His glory like a mirror (v. 18). The problem with the Jews was that they had a thick veil on their heart. If we are veiled, we cannot be transformed. However, whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Then we can behold the Lord with an unveiled face like a mirror. Consequently, what is expressed through us as a mirror is the glorious image of the Lord. In this way we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord from one level of glory to another level of glory for His expression.<h2 class=head2>The Believers Being Thus Transformed into the Same Image as the Lord from the Lord Spirit</h2><p>It is from the Lord Spirit, that is, from Christ as the life-giving Spirit, that the believers are being transformed into the same image as the Lord. This Spirit contains the bountiful supply to be our new element. Paul said that he lived Christ and magnified Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21a). If we live by our natural life, we cannot be transformed and we cannot magnify Christ. The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is an element in us. When this bountiful supply comes into us, it begins the inner process of metabolism and issues in an outward manifestation. People will see that what is manifested through us is not ourselves but Christ. We must enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and allow Him to work in us. This is transformation.<p>Suppose you and another brother live together. Every day that brother has morning revival, prays, reads the Bible, and meditates on the Lord&#8217;s word. After a period of time, you will surely notice some transformation in him. I am usually awake early in the morning at four or five o&#8217;clock, and I just muse on the Lord&#8217;s word. Then the Holy Spirit comes, and the light comes. When I touch Christ as the Spirit, His element comes into me and it issues in a metabolic function in me. This is similar to the metabolism in our body. After we eat some proper food and receive some proper element into us, the elements of the food become our element through digestion and assimilation so that we look so radiant and so energetic. If you touch the Lord day by day and allow His element to come into you, metabolism will spontaneously transpire in you that you may be transformed and eventually be like the Lord.<p>When we have problems in our daily life, we do not have to seek advice from others, because we have a spirit in us and the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in our spirit is very near to us. We can ask Him about everything, without any need to use the telephone or the fax machine, for He can talk with us right within us. You can talk with Him and confer with Him in everything. The Lord&#8217;s Word says, &#8220;In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God&#8221; (Phil. 4:6). Hence, if you have some problem, you just need to tell Him. He is right within you, and He is with you face to face. The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is in us not to trouble us but to be our Paraclete, Comforter, Supporter. I always pray, &#8220;O Lord, now I am going to take a walk. Support me, sustain me, and strengthen me.&#8221; This is to drink the Lord. In this way I have no anxiety. When anxiety comes, you should say, &#8220;O Lord, this anxiety is Yours, not mine; I give it to You because You bear it for me.&#8221; Thus, you receive the Lord&#8217;s element into you and metabolism will work constantly in you. Consequently, what is expressed through you outwardly is Christ. This is to live Christ. Those who do not know this secret consider to live Christ a difficult thing. Actually, you just need to practice speaking with the Lord constantly; then spontaneously you will live Christ.<h2 class=head2>Transformation Requiring the Believers&#8217; Outer Man to Be Decaying That Their Inner Man May Be Renewed Day by Day</h2><p>Eventually, transformation requires the believers&#8217; outer man to be decaying (consumed) that their inner man may be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). This does not require us to do it ourselves; instead, the Lord is working in our environment to consume our outer man. When the outer man is being consumed, decaying, the inner man is renewed day by day. God always gives us the most suitable spouse for our marriage. When a young person begins to choose a spouse, he puts forth much effort and follows many principles. After a great deal of consideration, eventually he chooses someone. Although the people around him do not agree with his choice, little do they know that it is God&#8217;s arrangement. After the two are married, they begin to deal with each other even from the very first night. One cannot sleep without the windows open, whereas the other catches a cold whenever the windows are open. When the discussion yields no solution, the two begin to quarrel. This is the mutual consuming between husband and wife. The more the husband is consumed by the wife, the more spiritual he becomes. The same is true in the church life. When several people serve in coordination, there is always someone who has a tough personality that is unbearable. Even so, you should not lose your temper, so you have to endure, sometimes even to the point of becoming ill. The Lord arranges this kind of situation that our outer man may be decaying so that our inner man may be renewed. In this way we are transformed.<h2 class=head1>BUILDING UP</h2><p>Following transformation, we want to see the building up in the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation.<h2 class=head2>Building Up Being the God-men&#8217;s Being Joined and Knit Together with Other God-men in the Divine Life by Their Growth in the Divine Life</h2><p>The transformation of the believers in the divine life causes them to be joined and knit together with other believers as fellow members of Christ because of their growth in the divine life. This joining and knitting together becomes the building of the God-men with other God-men in the divine life.<h2 class=head2>The Building Up Being Brought Forth through the Joining and Knitting by the Transforming Spirit</h2><p>This building in the divine life is the building of the jasper wall of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is not the result of piling a piece of jasper upon another piece of jasper, but the issue of the joining of all the jasper stones by the transforming Spirit. This building is also the building referred to in Ephesians 4:15-16 as the issue of the believers&#8217; growing into the Head, Christ, in all things, that is, &#8220;all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>For the Consummation of the Holy City, the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The building up of the Body of Christ mentioned in the New Testament is the building up by being joined and knit together in the divine life. This kind of building which is first carried out in the Body of Christ will consummate the building of the holy city, the New Jerusalem. This kind of building is a testimony and a great manifestation of the function of the divine life, that is, the manifestation of the glorious jasper-like image of God (Rev. 4:3a).<h2 class=head2>The Revelation in the New Testament</h2><p>Concerning God&#8217;s building on earth today, the New Testament contains sufficient revelation, teaching, instruction, and warning. Now let us mention them briefly.<p>First, in Matthew 16 after the Lord had led us to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, He immediately told us that upon this foundation of our knowledge of Him, He would build His church for resisting the gates of Hades (vv. 13-18).<p>Second, in John 1:51 the Lord told us in an implied way that for God&#8217;s wandering people on earth, there is the need for a builded house of God on earth to serve as the base for His heavenly ladder on earth to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven. In chapter two He declared that this house of God is built by Him in resurrection with His resurrection life and power (vv. 16-22). Then in 14:23 He told His close disciples that He and His Father would go to His lovers to make an abode with them (cf. 14:2).<p>Third, in Romans 12 the apostle exhorted us that we should think so as to be sober-minded concerning ourselves, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith, that we may be coordinated with all the members as one Body, that is, the building of God (vv. 3-5).<p>Fourth, in 1 Corinthians 1 the apostle condemned sectarianism and urged us to keep the oneness in the one Christ (vv. 10-13). In chapter three he said that we are God&#8217;s cultivated land, God&#8217;s building. We need to grow Christ as wheat and be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones, the element of the Divine Trinity, and thereby build the church of God on the foundation that has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. On the contrary, if we participate in God&#8217;s building by the flesh (wood), according to man&#8217;s will (grass), and according to the worldly people&#8217;s practices (stubble), our work will be consumed by the Lord and we will suffer loss (vv. 9-15).<p>Fifth, Galatians shows us that all of our living and work must pass through death and resurrection in Christ to be freed from the old creation and become the new creation for God&#8217;s building on earth (6:14-15).<p>Sixth, Ephesians, a book specifically on the church as the Body of Christ, stresses particularly the building up of the Body. Ephesians 3:17-19 says that Christ desires to make His home, to build His dwelling place, in our hearts that we may be filled with God unto the fullness of God for God&#8217;s expression.<p>Furthermore, chapter four reveals to us that the Body of Christ is an organism constituted and built with the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and His redeemed people, with the Father as the source, the Lord as the element, and the Spirit as the essence to be its intrinsic factors and the God-chosen, regenerated, and transformed believers to be its outward frame. No doubt, this is the building as the issue of the coordination of the God-chosen and transformed believers with the processed Triune God (vv. 4-6).<p>Chapter four goes on to show us that we need to be perfected until we become full-grown in Christ and are one in the faith, not being blown away or carried about by the winds of different teachings. It is only in this way that the Body of Christ can be built up (vv. 11-14). The same chapter also charges us to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, so that out from Him &#8220;all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&#8221; (vv. 15-16).<p>Seventh, in Revelation, in 3:12-13 the Lord promised His overcomer that He would make him a pillar in the temple of His God for him to be one with God, with the New Jerusalem, and with the Lord in His new name.<p>Ultimately, in Revelation 21 and 22 the hidden and mysterious God presents to the apostle John the New Jerusalem in its entirety as the consummation of all the revelations, visions, types, and prophecies in the holy Scripture, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The holy city, which was hidden from the ages in God, who created all things and mankind, and which was seen by John, is the dwelling place (tabernacle) of the Triune God in eternity. It is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God as the city itself-the nature of the Father as gold being its base, the pearls produced by the Son in the secretion of His resurrection life through His death and resurrection being its gates, and the precious stones, jasper in particular, transformed by the transforming Spirit being its wall and foundations-and His redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed elect. In the city there is a throne as the center for the ruling of God&#8217;s eternal kingdom; there are God and the Lamb as the temple in the city to be the place for His elect to worship and serve Him and to be their dwelling place; there are God and the Lamb as the light of the city; there is the river of water of life (the Spirit) flowing out of the throne, the center, to water the entire city and quench its thirst; and there is Christ as the tree of life growing in the river of water of life and producing new fruit in abundance as the supply to the entire city for its satisfaction and joy. Such a wonderful and unsearchable holy city becomes the mutual abode of God and His elect in eternity as God&#8217;s enlargement and expression for eternity.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between dispositional sanctification and transformation?<p>Answer: Dispositional sanctification is a change in disposition, a change in our peculiar disposition. Everyone has a peculiar and strange disposition, and there is no exception to this. After we have been sanctified, our former peculiar and strange disposition is changed and becomes proper, matching God&#8217;s nature. On the other hand, transformation is the outward manifestation as the issue of the metabolism in life within us. Dispositional sanctification changes our strange disposition, whereas transformation swallows up all the weaknesses in us by metabolism, resulting in an outward manifestation.<p>Question: When do we reach the maturity in life? At the Lord&#8217;s coming back or today?<p>Answer: Maturity is a daily matter, but no one dares to determine the degree of maturity. Paul said, &#8220;For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:4-5). If you feel that you have matured very much a month after you hear this message, it shows that you are not mature. The immature ones always feel that they are mature. On the contrary, the mature ones are humble and feel that they are not mature and are still lacking very much.<p>Question: We have been regenerated in life and changed in our disposition with God&#8217;s life and nature. Why do we still need to be transformed in our mind for our whole life?<p>Answer: God does not use our natural life; He uses only His own life. God has generated us in life, but our disposition is strange, so He sanctifies us with His holy nature. Furthermore, He also transforms us metabolically from within so that we have the outward expression of the divine image. This is the work of the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation. God carries out this organic work by His life, by His nature, and by the expression of His image. Eventually, the consummation of God&#8217;s work is for us to be conformed and glorified. However, all of these things must be carried out through transformation by the renewing of the mind. For example, the Bible clearly shows us that the Triune God is eternally co-existing and co-inhering, yet many in Christianity insist that there are three separate Gods. Another example is concerning 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says clearly that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, yet many in Christianity say that Christ and the Holy Spirit are two. This shows that unless our mind is turned, renewed, and transformed, we cannot accurately understand the Bible. The transformation of our mind takes a lifetime.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CONFORMATION AND GLORIFICATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:29; Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a; 1 John 3:2; Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12; Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the consummation of the divine economy.</li><li>Conformation-Rom. 8:29:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Conformation being the consummation of the believers&#8217; transformation in life.</li>	<li>Conformation being to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God&#8217;s firstborn Son being Christ as the God-man.</li>		<li>To be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son being that the believers become full-grown in life as God-men:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death in all things through the power of His resurrection-Phil. 3:10.</li>			<li>To live Christ for magnifying Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (who is the God-man)-Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>			<li>To be the reprints of the God-man, Christ, that the believers may be exactly like Him, the firstborn Son of God-1 John 3:2.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>Glorification-Rom. 8:30:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Glorification being the spreading forth of Christ&#8217;s glory from the believers by their growing to maturity in Christ&#8217;s life.</li>	<li>Being also the believers&#8217; entering into the glory of God-Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12.</li>	<li>Being also the believers&#8217; enjoyment of the redemption of their body-Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30.</li>	<li>Being also the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s complete salvation in the believers.</li>	<li>The ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s complete salvation being the New Jerusalem-the crystallization of the union and mingling of God with man, the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</li>	</ol></li><li>The interrelation of God&#8217;s judicial redemption and God&#8217;s organic salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God&#8217;s judicial redemption qualifies and positions the believers to enjoy God&#8217;s organic salvation and enter into God&#8217;s higher grace for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal economy and the attainment of God&#8217;s ultimate purpose.</li>	<li>Judicially, the church of God, which He redeemed and obtained through His own blood (Acts 20:28), was produced through God&#8217;s judicial redemption.

Regeneration is to have God&#8217;s life put into us in addition to our own life. After regeneration, we still need God&#8217;s shepherding in life. Furthermore, we need to be sanctified in our disposition by allowing God to change our peculiar being with His holy nature as the element. The man created by God was upright, honest, and not crooked, but after the fall, man became deceitful, dishonest, and strange. Among us there are many couples who have been married for many years, but are there a husband and wife who have never lied to each other? The husbands always claim that they are faithful and honest to their wives, but God knows that they often deal with their wives deceitfully so that they themselves may gain some advantage and their wives may suffer loss. We fallen people are corrupt by birth. Hence, we need God&#8217;s sanctifying work to change us dispositionally.<p>Furthermore, we need renewing. The renewing referred to in the Scriptures is to have the divine essence added into our being. Renewing is altogether a matter of changing our mind. In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said that the old covenant was of the letter and had no life in it, but we, as ministers of the new covenant, are ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit (v. 6). The Jews regarded the Mosaic law according to the letter, so their heart turned away from God. When they thus turned away from God to live and walk according to the Mosaic law in letter, layer after layer of veils were put on their heart. The Jews had received the traditional teachings from their forefathers through generations, so their mind was fixed, shaped, and difficult to alter. The same is true with the old Christians in Christianity today. Their heart must turn to the Lord so that the veils covering them may be taken away. Hence, in 2 Corinthians 3:16 Paul said, &#8220;But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&#8221;<p>When our heart turns away from the Lord to other things, those things become layers of veils covering us. Today the different schools of theology have their preconceptions. There is only one Bible, yet everyone&#8217;s reading is different. For example, in general, those who teach concerning the Trinity in theology consider that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. In their concept, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separated. Many insist on the traditional concept, so they are not able to see the pure truth in the Bible. Another example is concerning the human spirit. Many people have never seen that man has a spirit. However, there are at least three portions in the Scriptures that refer to both the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. First, John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit (the human spirit). Second, John 3:6 says that that which is born of the Spirit (the Spirit of God) is spirit (the spirit of man). Third, Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. If we have a renewed mind, we can see clearly from these three passages that within us we have a human spirit.<p>I am afraid that after listening to the messages for three or four days, some of you who are here still have the veils within you. The Bible says that renewing is in the spirit of your mind (Eph. 4:23). Only when your spirit becomes the spirit of your mind can you be renewed. This means that your mind can be renewed only when it has the spirit spread into it. If your mind is filled with yourself, you cannot be renewed. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; This verse clearly refers to Christ as the Spirit, yet if you insist on not believing, there is no help for you. You need to put aside what you insist on and open yourself to the Lord. The Lord will say to you, &#8220;Child, My word says that I am Spirit, so you should also say that I am Spirit.&#8221; If you receive the Lord&#8217;s word in this way, your mind will be renewed.<p>We need to be not only renewed but also transformed. Transformation is altogether a matter of the divine life working metabolically in us that we may be transformed not only in our inward disposition but also in our outward image, that is, to be transformed into the same image as the Lord. After transformation, we still need to be built up. We need to be joined and knit together in the divine life for the building up of the Body of Christ which will consummate the building of the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>CONFORMATION</h2><p>In this message we will cover the matters of conformation and glorification. It is not easy to present the truths. Augustine said that if you try to comprehend the Triune God, it is like using a small ladle to measure the ocean. It is really so. Just as the truth concerning the Triune God is profound, so also is the truth concerning conformation. Not only do we need to be transformed and built up, but we also need to be conformed.<h2 class=head2>Being Conformed to the Image of God&#8217;s Firstborn Son</h2><p>To whom or to what are we to be conformed? Are we to be conformed to the likeness of the Chinese or Americans or Japanese? We are to be conformed to the likeness of the Son of God. Romans 8:29 says, &#8220;Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; God&#8217;s predestinating us to be conformed to the image of His Son is for His Son to be the Firstborn among His many sons.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Firstborn Son Being Christ as the God-man</h2><p>Concerning the Son of God, there is a very difficult question in theology, that is: How many sons does God have? Hebrews 12:23 mentions the church of the firstborn. The firstborn sons here refer to us, the saints. But how can we say that the saints are the firstborn sons? James 1:18 says that God &#8220;brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&#8221; As the constituents of the church, we are the firstfruits of God&#8217;s creatures. To say that the firstfruits refer to the firstborn sons is a relative way of speaking. The day will come when both the Gentiles and the Jews will turn to worship God. Although that situation is not here yet, today we believers take the lead to worship God. Hence, in this sense we are the firstborn sons, the firstfruits of God&#8217;s creatures.<p>On the other hand, John 1 says that Christ is the only begotten Son of God (v. 18), whereas Romans 8 says that Christ would be the Firstborn among many brothers (v. 29). Christ was the only begotten Son of God, and then He became the firstborn Son of God with many brothers. Hence, as the Son of God, Christ has two statuses, one being the only begotten Son and the other, the firstborn Son. What is the difference between God&#8217;s only begotten Son and God&#8217;s firstborn Son? God&#8217;s only begotten Son has divinity but not humanity, whereas God&#8217;s firstborn Son has both divinity and humanity. When God became flesh, He brought divinity into humanity; when the Lord was resurrected, He brought humanity into divinity, that is, He mingled humanity with divinity. The mingling of humanity with divinity produced the second status of the Son of God, that is, the firstborn Son of God.<p>In eternity the Lord was the only begotten Son of God. In time He became flesh to be a man, but He was not yet the firstborn Son of God. When did He become the firstborn Son of God? Romans 1:3-4 says, &#8220;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; There are two &#8220;accordings&#8221; here: according to the flesh, He is the seed of David, a man; according to the Spirit of holiness, He is the Son of God. He was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.<p>When and how was the designation done? This requires a little explanation. First Peter 3:18 says, &#8220;For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&#8221; This verse tells us that after He died in the flesh, Christ was still active in His Spirit. What was He doing? In John 12:24 the Lord said that He was the grain of wheat which bears much fruit by falling into the ground and dying. When a grain of wheat falls into the ground, its outer shell dies and decays, but its life within is active. The grain on the one hand dies and on the other, lives. When the grain dies, this death gives the life within an opportunity to operate to bring forth tender sprouts. This is resurrection. When the Lord was buried in the tomb, His flesh, the humanity that was with Him, died. However, His divinity, the Spirit of holiness, had a great opportunity to work. First, He resurrected the humanity of Christ. At the same time, He uplifted the humanity of Jesus into divinity. It was at that moment that God said, &#8220;You are My Son; today I have begotten You&#8221; (Acts 13:33). &#8220;Today&#8221; here refers to the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Hence, it was at the time that the Spirit of holiness uplifted the humanity of Christ and resurrected His flesh that God said, &#8220;Today I have begotten You.&#8221; From that time on, He has been the firstborn Son of God.<p>Since He is the firstborn Son, there must also be the brothers. Otherwise, how can He be called the Firstborn? His brothers are we the saved ones. Actually, we and He as the firstborn Son were all brought forth in the same delivery. We were born in His resurrection. First Peter 1:3 says that at the time of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, that is, in His resurrection, God regenerated all of us. You should not think that you have been regenerated for two months, or that you have been regenerated for sixty-seven years. You were regenerated two thousand years ago by being resurrected together with Christ. Some may not be able to accept this word. Again, this is a problem of the mind. God has His timetable and you have your timetable; the two timetables have different ways of counting. We need to take God&#8217;s way of counting. According to His counting, He chose us before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4); furthermore, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world, that is, from the creation of the heavens and the earth (Rev. 13:8). According to God&#8217;s way of reckoning, at the resurrection of Christ, that is, about two thousand years ago, we were resurrected with Him and were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3).<p>After regeneration, we became children of God, the many sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ. However, we still need to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son. We are to be conformed not to God&#8217;s only begotten Son but to God&#8217;s firstborn Son because God&#8217;s only begotten Son does not have humanity, but God&#8217;s firstborn Son has both divinity and humanity. Why is it that after we were regenerated to become the sons of God, we still have to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son? Although we were regenerated to become sons of God, we are not yet like sons of God. Perhaps this morning some of you husbands and wives still had a quarrel, and after the quarreling you came to the meeting. Therefore, we need to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers. In the United States today about one hundred twenty million, which is half of the population, are Protestants and Catholics. However, wherever you go today, as you observe, can you discern the Christians? If you listen to people&#8217;s talk in the offices, especially on Mondays, it is all about where they went to dance or went for pleasures over the weekend, and many filthy words are spoken. Many among them are Christians, yet they have not been conformed to the image of Christ. Hence, today we urgently need to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son. To be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son equals to live out His image. When we all live out His image, the world will see Christ as the Firstborn of God because all His brothers will be manifested here.<h2 class=head2>Being Conformed to the Lord&#8217;s Death</h2><p>How can we be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Firstborn? To know how to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Firstborn, we must understand how God&#8217;s Firstborn lived on earth. The firstborn Son of God is both the Son of God and the Son of Man. He is the God-man, and He lived the life of a man on earth. The life which He lived on earth was the very life which God desired man to live when He created man. After the fall, man was not able to live the life which God wanted man to live. Hence, the only begotten Son of God came to become the Son of Man. In the four Gospels, from beginning to end, the Lord called Himself the Son of Man (Matt. 8:20; 26:64); He lived as a man on earth. He lived as a man daily under the shadow of the cross, denying and crucifying Himself daily. He told people that none of the words which He spoke was spoken by Himself and none of the things which He did was done out of His own desire (John 8:28-29; 14:10). He spoke words and did things according to His Father&#8217;s will. By doing this He fulfilled what God required judicially. This was why He was qualified to die for us on the cross. In His human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus was tested and tried by God. Eventually, according to God&#8217;s requirement of righteousness judicially, He was qualified to go to the cross to bear our sins and die for us. God considered Him a sinner, even sin (2 Cor. 5:21), and condemned Him on the cross. His death was altogether a judicial matter for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s requirement of righteousness judicially. This was what He did as the Son of Man. The crucified life which He lived on earth as the Son of Man became a mold; we should be conformed to such a mold (Phil. 3:10b).<p>Today we the saved ones are the same as He is. According to the flesh, we are sons of Adam; we may also say that according to the Spirit of holiness, we are sons of God. However, we have not yet lived like sons of God. Whether or not you live like a son of God depends on whether or not you are living under the shadow of death. Have you died to yourself in dealing with your wife, your husband, your children, or anyone else? To give up ourselves, to remain on the cross, to die to ourselves, is to be conformed to the Lord&#8217;s death. When we are thus conformed to His death, the Spirit will operate in us. This is like a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying; the outer shell decays, but the life within begins to operate. This is referred to in a hymn: &#8220;Only then as death is working/Will His life thru me be poured./If no death, no life...&#8221; (Hymns, #631).<p>If we want to experience being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son, we need to be daily conformed to His death. This is not a matter of endurance. We do not need to learn to try our best to endure; we need to die. When your wife makes you angry, the more you try to endure, the more you will have stomach trouble. What you need is not to endure but to die. Perhaps you would say that you do not know how to die. You need to pray unceasingly. When your wife changes her countenance toward you, pray to the Lord. If you cannot pray outwardly, pray in your heart. The more you pray, the more you know how to die to yourself. Thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters among us more or less have this kind of experience. Some may not have much experience. When they come home happy and notice their wife&#8217;s changed countenance, they would say, &#8220;O Lord, amen.&#8221; But when they are unhappy, they would counter her with a changed countenance or even start to hit her. This is not to be sons of God, but sons of Adam, even sons of the devil (1 John 3:10). Our living becomes an expression of the sons of the devil. If we live this way, how can Christ be the Firstborn among us? Hence, we need to have the experience of conformation every day in our living.<p>In summary, conformation is the consummation of the believers&#8217; transformation in life, and it is also to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, who is Christ as the God-man. To be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son is the believers&#8217; becoming full-grown in life as God-men. This is to be conformed to His death in all things through the resurrection power of Christ (Phil. 3:10) and to live Christ for magnifying Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the God-man (Phil. 1:19-21a). This is to be the reprints of the God-man, Christ, that we may be exactly like Him, the firstborn Son of God (1 John 3:2).<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION</h2><p>To be glorified is to enter into glory. After passing through regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, and conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God, the believers are mature and qualified to be raptured, and they are simply awaiting the Lord&#8217;s coming back. When the Lord comes back, they will enter into glory to enjoy the highest portion of the divine sonship (Rom. 8:23). Hence, glorification is the spreading forth of Christ&#8217;s glory from the believers by their growing to maturity in Christ&#8217;s life. We may say that glorification is the manifestation of the glory of the firstborn Son of God from within us, or that it is our entering into glory (Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12). This glory is the Triune God. Hence, to enter into glory is to enter into the Triune God. When our entire being enters into the Triune God, we are glorified. Glorification is also the believers&#8217; enjoyment of the redemption of their body (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30). This is also the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s complete salvation in the believers. At this point, God&#8217;s organic work has been completed. God&#8217;s organic work is from regeneration to glorification, from God&#8217;s entering into man to man&#8217;s practically being brought into God. Regeneration is God entering into man, whereas glorification is man entering into God. Thus, man is altogether mingled and joined with God to express the image of God. That is glorification. The ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s complete salvation is the New Jerusalem-the crystallization of the union and mingling of God with man, the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.<h2 class=head2>The Interrelation of God&#8217;s Judicial Redemption and God&#8217;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>Finally, we want to see the interrelation between God&#8217;s judicial redemption and God&#8217;s organic salvation. God&#8217;s judicial redemption and God&#8217;s organic salvation are very much related. The judicial redemption was accomplished by Christ on earth in thirty-three and a half years. The organic salvation is being carried out by Christ from His resurrection through eternity. The relationship between the two is that first, God&#8217;s judicial redemption as the procedure qualifies and positions the believers to enjoy God&#8217;s organic salvation and enter into God&#8217;s higher grace for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal economy and the attainment of God&#8217;s ultimate purpose.<p>Second, judicially, the church of God was produced through God&#8217;s judicial redemption. Without such a redemption, the church could not have been produced, because Acts 20:28 says that God purchased, redeemed, His church through His own blood. On the other hand, organically, the church of God is constituted with the God-regenerated people in the divine life. This organic aspect issues in the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23).<p>Third, God&#8217;s organic salvation needs to be maintained constantly through God&#8217;s judicial redemption. You should not say that since you have the judicial redemption and therefore have entered into the organic salvation, you no longer have anything to do with the judicial aspect nor do you need the judicial aspect. No, you still need God&#8217;s judicial redemption. God&#8217;s organic salvation needs to be maintained constantly through God&#8217;s judicial redemption. For example, when the fellowship of the believers with God is interrupted due to their sins, they need to have their fellowship restored through the redeeming blood of Christ. Hence, 1 John 1:6-9 says that if we sin, we need to confess our sins to God and ask for His forgiveness; then God will wash away our sins with the blood of Christ and restore our fellowship with Him. Therefore, organically, when our fellowship with God is broken, it has to be restored through the redeeming blood. In addition, when the believers have a case against them before God because of their sinning, Christ, their Redeemer, is responsible for undertaking their case in His status as their Advocate in heaven before God (1 John 2:1-2). We should not say that since we are in the organic salvation, we have nothing to do with redemption anymore. The redemption is still here maintaining us because sometimes we may still be weak.<p>Fourth, the believers&#8217; ultimate transfiguration in their body to enter into God&#8217;s glory is the redemption of their body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23). Why is it that at that time our body will still need to be redeemed? At that time we will have been transformed into the image of the Lord and will soon be raptured into glory, so why is it that our body will still need to be redeemed? This is because regardless of how spiritual, renewed, and transformed the believers are, their body still belongs to the old creation and therefore still needs God&#8217;s judicial redemption that it may receive God&#8217;s organic salvation and be transfigured to enter into glory (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:30). Our being raptured and transfigured to enter into glory is an organic matter, but our body still needs to be redeemed. Hence, there is the need of the redemption of the body.<p>Fifth, God&#8217;s judicial redemption as the procedure is purposeless without God&#8217;s organic salvation. It would be merely for sinners to be redeemed, have their sins forgiven, and become righteous people justified by God, but the purpose is unclear to the majority of believers who mistakenly consider their going to heaven as the purpose of their being redeemed and are unaware that, according to the revelation of the holy Scriptures, God&#8217;s judicial redemption as the procedure is with God&#8217;s organic salvation as the purpose, which is to regenerate us, shepherd us, sanctify us dispositionally, renew us, transform us, and build us up into the Body of Christ, which ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem as the ultimate purpose of God&#8217;s organic salvation to be God&#8217;s enlargement and expression in eternity.</body></html>
