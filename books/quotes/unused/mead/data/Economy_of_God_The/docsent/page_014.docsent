   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MIND, WILL, AND EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are three parts to the soul and three parts to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must discover what the three parts of both the soul and the spirit are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, we must also define the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are a tripartite being spirit, soul, and body but it does not mention the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the heart, and how can we relate it to the inward parts and the hidden part?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s Word proves clearly and definitely that the soul is of three parts the mind, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Proverbs 2:10 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>19:2 suggests that the soul needs knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since knowledge is a function of the mind, this proves that the mind is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two verses from Proverbs tell us that we need to have knowledge in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Psalm 139:14 says that the soul knows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To know is something of the mind, which again proves that the mind is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 13:2 says that the soul takes counsel, or considers ASV , which refers to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lamentations 3:20 indicates that the soul remembers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From these verses we can see that there is a part in the soul that knows, considers, and remembers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This part is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second part of the soul is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Job 7:15 says that the soul chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To choose something is a decision made by the act of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that the will must be a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Job 6:7 says that the soul refuses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To choose and refuse are both functions of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Chronicles 22:19 says, Set your...soul to seek.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as we set our mind to think, so we set our soul to seek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is, of course, the soul making a decision, which proves that the will must be a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then Numbers 30 speaks of binding one s soul ten times ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we read this chapter, we understand that to bind the soul is to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is related to a vow that is made with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To make a decision to bind the soul is to make a vow to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, this is proof that the will must be a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Psalm 27:12; 41:2; and Ezekiel 16:27 ASV translate the Hebrew word for soul into will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prayer made by the psalmist is, Do not give me over / To the desire lit. soul of my adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves clearly that the will must be a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The emotion is the third part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With the emotion there are many aspects, for example, love, hatred, joy, grief, etc. All these are expressions of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>References to love in relation to the soul are found in 1 Samuel 18:1 and Song of Songs 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These verses show that love is in the soul, proving, therefore, that within the soul there is such an organ, or function, as the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning hatred, 2 Samuel 5:8, Psalm 107:18, and Ezekiel 36:5 speak of hating, loathing, and despising in relation to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since these are expressions of the emotion, these verses also prove that the emotion must be a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As seen in Isaiah 61:10 and Psalm 86:4, exultation and rejoicing also are related to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since these are of the emotion, this again proves that the emotion is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Grief, another expression of the soul, is mentioned in 1 Samuel 30:6 and Judges 10:16 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Samuel 20:4, Deuteronomy 14:26, Ezekiel 24:25, and Jeremiah 44:14 mention desire in relation to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning Ezekiel 24:25 and Jeremiah 44:14, the right meaning is reached when the American Standard Version is checked with Young s or Strong s Concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These verses show that desire, an element of the emotion, is in the realm of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These verses establish the ground to verify the three parts of the soul: the mind, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Scriptures it is difficult to find any additional parts of the soul, for these three parts cover all the functions of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The mind is the leading part, followed by the will and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are the verses that best reveal what the three parts of the soul are.</S>
