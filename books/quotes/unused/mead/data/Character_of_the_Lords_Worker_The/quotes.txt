[1]  CONTENTS A Good Listener A Lover of Men Having a Mind to Suffer Buffeting the Body and Making It a Slave Diligent Restrained Stable Not Subjective Towards Money A Few Other Matters PREFACE
[2]  The personal life of a worker of the Lord is intimately related to his work.
[3]  A man must have not only a certain amount of spiritual experience, but a certain constitution in his disposition; the Lord must constitute a certain kind of disposition within him.
[4]  When a brother is trying to explain his problem, how much do you understand of what he is saying?
[5]  Third, we must be able to detect what others are saying in their spirit.
[6]  Beyond hearing the words a person may utter and the words he may deliberately refrain from uttering, we have to hear what we have referred to as the words that his spirit is speaking.
[7]  How can we acquire the ability to listen and understand?
[8]  If we have our own subjective concepts and ideas about people, it will be difficult for us to hear what others are saying because our mind is already full.
[9]  If we have not been dealt with by God, we will not be able to sing "hallelujah" when others express their joy, and we will not be able to share their grief when they express their sorrow.
[10]  In order to do this, we must be very objective in regard to our own feelings.
[11]  We may feel something, but we must be objective in regard to our own feelings before we can have the capacity to feel what he feels.
[12]  But if we are too busy with our own feelings, we will not be sensitive enough to consider his feelings.
[13]  The first thing a worker of the Lord has to learn is to listen to others.
[14]  When a brother or a sister is speaking or when an unbeliever is speaking, we have to learn to listen.
[15]  We must be in perfect stillness, void of our own thoughts, our own subjective opinions, and our own feelings, before we can listen quietly to others and understand what they are saying.
[16]  If we do not learn this lesson well, we will encounter problems in our service.
[17]  Every worker of the Lord must have not only a love for the brothers but also a love for all men.
[18]  A servant or worker of the Lord is not fit to serve Him if he is lacking in brotherly love or if he only has brotherly love but is lacking in love for all men.
[19]  When we really come to understand the Word of God, we will realize that the term children of God is not so weighty as the term man, and we also will realize that God's plan, selection, and predestination have a glorified man as their objective.
[20]  When we see the place that man occupies in the purpose of God, when we see man as the focus of all His plans, and when we see how the Lord humbled Himself to become a man, we will learn to appreciate all men.
[21]  The Lord Jesus said, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" Mark 10:45 .
[22]  Mark 10:45 says, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."
[23]  If we have no interest in man and do not find him precious, and if we have no awareness that we are all fellow creatures of God, we cannot preach about sacrifice.
[24]  All sins can be forgiven; we can sympathize with all weaknesses and activities of the flesh.
[25]  Unless we can humble ourselves to the lowest level, we cannot serve God.
[26]  We must be brought to the lowest point; we must never feel that we are better than others.
[27]  In remembering that every servant of God has his own special characteristic and function to God, we should not forget that, no matter how different one's function may be, all true servants of God are alike in this respect: They are interested, intensely interested, in men.
[28]  If a brother has an enlarged heart and is interested in men, his usefulness in the hand of God will be greatly enhanced.
[29]  If we see how the Lord has died for men, we will echo that very character that led Him to suffer such a death for men; we will feel what the Lord feels and conclude that man does deserve all of our love and interest.
[30]  In addition to the character traits already mentioned, every Christian worker should have a mind to suffer 1 Pet 4:1 .
[31]  We have to realize that suffering and having a mind to suffer are two different things.
[32]  Having a mind to suffer implies that we have a desire to willingly suffer for Christ's sake; it means that we have a heart and a willingness to endure affliction on His behalf.
[33]  The Lord may not arrange for you to suffer every day, but every worker of the Lord must not be short of a mind to suffer, not even for a single day.
[34]  If we can only accept the good provisions of the Lord, but cannot take any trial, instead backsliding at any change and ceasing from our work, we do not have a mind to suffer.
[35]  There are some brothers and sisters who endure suffering, but they have no conception of the preciousness of the suffering.
[36]  They go through it without any sense of gratitude to the Lord.
[37]  If we have a mind to suffer, the Lord may not necessarily give us sufferings, but when we do encounter sufferings, we will be inwardly prepared, and we will not draw back.
[38]  Now we have to consider some common problems we encounter in the Lord's work.
[39]  Brothers and sisters, whether or not we will perform well in our work depends a great deal on whether we have a mind to suffer.
[40]  If we have a mind to suffer, we will defy difficulties; we will defy hardship; we will defy physical infirmity; and we will even defy death.
[41]  This is not a matter of how much we suffer, but to what extent we can endure suffering.
[42]  Suffering is not a necessity, but a mind to suffer is.
[43]  No brother or sister learning to serve the Lord will be strong if he or she does not have a mind to suffer.
[44]  If we do not have a mind to suffer, we will be the weakest of all men.
[45]  A question naturally arises: To what extent should we be prepared to suffer?
[46]  If there is any compromise, we would rather let the Lord do the compromising; we would rather let the church or the more mature brothers balance us.
[47]  Verse 24 says, "Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run?"
[48]  Verse 26 says, "I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air."
[49]  This means that Paul was not running in an aimless way; he knew where he was going.
[50]  What does it mean for our body to become our slave?
[51]  If we are easy with our body at ordinary times, our legs, feet, lungs, and every other organ will not come under our control at the time of the race, and we will not be able to meet the demand of the race.
[52]  If we lack such training at ordinary times, and if we have never buffeted our body or dealt with it, it will not submit to us at a time of need.
[53]  The same principle applies to the matter of eating.
[54]  Many times our Lord went without food for the sake of His work.
[55]  We dare not find fault with a worker for enjoying a measure of ease in his living.
[56]  But when his work calls for his sacrifice, his body should not ignore the call of the work if the comforts he was accustomed to are not provided.
[57]  If our body will not respond to our call, we cannot work for the Lord.
[58]  Many workers of the Lord love themselves so much that they excuse themselves from work as soon as they are slightly sick.
[59]  If a servant of the Lord is seriously sick and the Lord has not imposed a special burden upon him, it is right for him to take care of his sickness; the church should know what to do with him, and the other co-workers should also know what to do with him.
[60]  Brothers and sisters, do not think for a moment that you can relax your rein on the demands of the body.
[61]  The daily life of a Christian worker often determines whether he is qualified for the Lord's work.
[62]  A young man may hold great promise in many areas, but if fundamental features are lacking, he cannot work for the Lord, even though his desire to serve the Lord is genuine and even though he has prepared himself for it.
[63]  I do not know what these ones make of themselves in other professions, but I have never seen a person who is unable to control and rule over his body prove to be a useful servant of the Lord, nor have I seen a man who does not have a mind to suffer who can serve the Lord.
[64]  Matthew 25:18, 24-28, 30 says, "But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master's money....Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.
[65]  Those who have the intention to work will always find work to do.
[66]  Those who have no intention to work are always afraid that work will come their way.
[67]  If we have not looked to God for work, prayed for work, and found work, we are lazy, and we will not be able to accomplish much work.
[68]  The word in Greek for diligence is spoude or spoudazo.
[69]  We should be diligent, and this means that we should not be afraid of responsibility, that we should serve the Lord with zeal, and that we should be burning in spirit.
[70]  We should always feel that we do not have enough, that we will not settle for what we have, and that we will not stop until we abound and are no longer idle or unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[71]  Please read verse 15: "Moreover I will also be diligent that you may be able, after my exodus, to bring these things to mind at all times."
[72]  Many people could be very useful in the hand of God; they could be a powerful vessel to the Lord.
[73]  Yet they remain useless to God, or they are used by Him in only a limited way.
[74]  There are several points connected with the matter of speaking, and we should take note of them.
[75]  First, let us note before the Lord the kind of talk we hear all the time.
[76]  Many people will not tell you some things because they know that you are not like them, and it would be useless to say that thing to you.
[77]  Fifth, there are those who are intentionally double-tongued.
[78]  Some are double-tongued in a way that is more serious than others; they are worse than those who are double-tongued through ignorance; they are intentionally double-tongued.
[79]  Sixth, we must deal with the very way we listen.
[80]  If we are not disciplined and restricted in our words, it is very possible that while we are speaking God's word, we are spreading rumors and gossip at the same time.
[81]  Eighth, we have to pay special attention to the matter of lies.
[82]  The double-tongued person to whom we have referred is a close kinsman of the liar.
[83]  If a brother asks a question we do not wish to answer or are unable to answer, we should politely refuse to reply, but we should not deceive the brother.
[84]  Tenth, we need to pay attention to the matter of motive and fact.
[85]  What we say is one thing, but our motive is another thing.
[86]  If we do not pay attention to accuracy in facts, we will be of little use to the Lord even if our words are correct.
[87]  Some brothers and sisters pay much attention to their words, yet we cannot trust them, because even though we have never found a mistake in their words, we know that they are only concerned about the correctness of their words; they are not concerned about the correctness of their facts.
[88]  When we speak to others, we should not just pay attention to correctness in procedure and assume that we are telling the truth; we should instead pay attention to our motive before the Lord.
[89]  Many jokes, light talks, and jestings have to be ruled out.
[90]  It is of course a different story when some brothers and sisters make a few clever remarks once a while, or when they say a few amusing words to their children and grandchildren.
[91]  A worker of the Lord must speak accurate words; he must not be careless with his tongue.
[92]  The brothers and sisters may be entertained by our gossip and interesting tales, but we will fail to command their respect when we speak for the Lord.
[93]  If we are used to loose words and always indulge ourselves in unrestrained conversations, the impact of our words on those who listen will be the same when we speak for the Lord as it is when we speak in a loose way.
[94]  Let us give an example to show the meaning of being accurate.
[95]  One day they came to the Lord and posed a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
[96]  He has his own special portion before the Lord, and God uses him by bringing out his special portion.
[97]  Brothers and sisters, in the face of such solemn facts, we need to be careful about our speaking.
[98]  We should repent before the Lord for many words that have gone out of our mouth.
[99]  Stability is another character trait that must be found in the life of every Christian worker.
[100]  First John 5:1 says, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God," and verse 13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."
[101]  In verse 18 the Lord seemed to be making a hidden reference to the words in Matthew 7, in which He spoke of those who build their houses upon the sand, and when rain and water and wind come, the houses totter to the ground.
[102]  Then He said that we should build our house upon the rock so that it will not fall when the rain and water and wind come.
[103]  The Lord said that the church is built upon the rock, which means that the church will never fall.
[104]  The effectiveness of a minister has much to do with the stability of his character.
[105]  If a man is shaky before God, he cannot be a minister, and the church cannot follow him.
[106]  The Bible tells us that after Peter recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:17 .
[107]  Peter did not deserve any merit, but the Father's revelation enabled him to see the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God.
[108]  After the last supper the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."
[109]  Peter said, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" 26:31, 33 .
[110]  But we must remember that we do not know anything about many of the things that we say to the Lord at the time of our consecration and revival.
[111]  If another brother says, "You may think that you are loving the Lord, but actually you are not," they will argue, "If I do not love the Lord, who does?"
[112]  Mark 14 also provides us with a record of Peter's denial of the Lord.
[113]  And he was there sitting with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire" v. 54 . A servant girl of the high priest came and said to Peter, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus" v. 67 . Peter denied this and answered, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about" v. 68 . Here was a man who had followed the Lord for three and a half years.
[114]  Brothers and sisters, the church of God has the nature of a stone.
[115]  A lazy man can be changed into a diligent man; a talkative man can be changed into a man of few words; an insensitive man can be changed into a man who listens; a man who is afraid of sufferings can be changed into one who is fearless in the face of sufferings; a man who cannot control his body can be changed into one who is a master of his body.
[116]  Subjectivity is another defect in the character of some of God's children, and in particular, of some workers for the Lord.
[117]  When we meet some brothers, we cannot help but sigh in our heart, "My brother, how many things can a person like you learn from the Lord?"
[118]  Another big problem of a subjective person is that he cannot receive any guidance from God.
[119]  It is interesting to note that when we identify our will with God's will, there often comes a time when God's will changes.
[120]  If our own will cannot change accordingly, it will be hard for us to act simply according to His word.
[121]  In regard to subjectivity, a further point should be noted: Our subjectivity must be dealt with by God before we will be fit to deal with others.
[122]  God will lead us to deal with other men only when we ourselves are first dealt with.
[123]  If a subjective person is put into God's work to instruct others in the way of God, his own will comes out ten times stronger than does the Lord's. A subjective person wants everyone to listen to him.
[124]  We have to learn to not dominate others with our own thought.
[125]  When others do not want to hear our word, we should turn away; we should not force them to listen to it.
[126]  If we have a burden before the Lord, we should tell the brothers and sisters about it.
[127]  He cannot listen to what others have to say, and he cannot receive guidance from the Lord.
[128]  He does not feel that he has to learn anything from anyone; therefore, God cannot trust him with any work.
[129]  If we have made all the decisions already before we come to God, we will not find out God's decision.
[130]  A subjective person likes to take over and make proposals.
[131]  If a person is subjective, he creates problems in God's work.
[132]  What should be the attitude of a Christian worker, a servant of God, towards money?
[133]  This is quite a serious question, and unless a worker has a definite breakthrough in this matter, he cannot work for the Lord.
[134]  Any Christian worker who has not resolved the issue of money within himself and who is still bound by the power of money is certain to relate his field of work to money.
[135]  When he has to decide where he will work, his decision will surely be influenced by financial support.
[136]  In the New Testament Peter spoke of the way of Balaam.
[137]  He showed us what it is: "Having eyes full of adultery and not ceasing from sin; enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised for covetousness, children of curse" 2 Pet 2:14 .
[138]  "Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness" v. 15 . What happens when a person falls into habitual covetousness? He forsakes the straight way, goes astray, and follows the way of Balaam, the son of Beor! Brothers and sisters, God has set before us "the straight way." Which way should we go? Some have forsaken the straight way, gone astray, and followed the way of Balaam.
[139]  In addition to making reference to Balaam, 2 Peter 2:3 describes another condition: "In covetousness, with fabricated words, they will make merchandise of you, for whom the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber."
[140]  Let us now consider how the Lord Jesus trained His disciples.
[141]  We can find out more about the Lord's training of His disciples in the feeding of the five thousand and then the four thousand.
[142]  On one of these occasions, He took His disciples with Him and preached to a large crowd of five thousand, not including women and children.
[143]  The Lord repeated this miracle because the twelve disciples needed to be trained twice.
[144]  Had the Lord not fed the five thousand and four thousand, the disciples probably would not have been able to handle the situation at Pentecost.
[145]  He said, "For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me" v. 11 . The Lord was saying that there is nothing wrong about caring for the poor, but we cannot hold back anything when it comes to sacrificing for the Lord.
[146]  Paul told us not only how he maintained his integrity, but also how he worked with his two hands to supply the needs of his co-workers.
[147]  If we keep all that we have received and only make provisions for ourselves, we do not know the meaning of the work of a minister.
[148]  If we keep money in our hands, no matter how little it may be, and if, at the same time, we expect God to constantly work on the other brothers and sisters, we will find that God does just the opposite; He will not entrust His money to our hands.
[149]  In 2 Corinthians 12:14 Paul said, "Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden."
[150]  No. He continued in the same verse, saying, "For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children." Brothers and sisters, do you see how sweet Paul's attitude before God was? The Corinthians heard many rumors and said many things about Paul.
[151]  In 2 Corinthians 12:15-18 he continued, saying, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls.
[152]  Let us turn to Paul's letter to the Philippians to see his attitude in receiving offerings from the saints there.
[153]  Philippians 4:15-17 says, "You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the account of giving and receiving except you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.
[154]  Finally, let us consider Paul's attitude in relation to funds that the church passed through his hands and which others wanted him to manage.
[155]  In 2 Corinthians 8:1-4 he wrote, "Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality; that according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord, with much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints."
[156]  And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, and not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness; avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.
[157]  In this chapter we will speak of a few other matters, namely: 1 upholding the absoluteness of the truth, 2 taking care of our physical health, 3 daily habits, and 4 marriage and virginity.
[158]  Many difficulties arise in the church today because God's children sacrifice the truth.
[159]  A local church became divided after a brother said, "I had no intention to be separated from you, but last night something happened in the church, and I was not informed of it.
[160]  What does it mean to be absolute to the truth?
[161]  It means to set aside feelings, to ignore personal relationships, and to not stand for the self.
[162]  All judgments are based on truth, not on individuals.
[163]  Whenever the basis of judgment is shifted to an individual, we have compromised God's way and His truth.
[164]  When we confront a situation, we should ask what God's truth is, not what our feelings are.
[165]  A worker of the Lord also has to pay attention to his own body.
[166]  Brothers and sisters, we should not have the concept that we should neglect our body.
[167]  It is true that we need a mind to suffer and that we need to reign over our body and put it under subjection.
[168]  Brothers and sisters, when we are free, we have to learn to relax our muscles.
[169]  While we are sleeping, all of our limbs should be relaxed.
[170]  We should be able to stretch our capacity when there is the need for it, and when we do, we should be able to handle more stress than the strongest men.
[171]  We should not overeat, and we should not be too restricted in the variety of food we eat.
[172]  If we want to serve the Lord properly, we have to maintain one principle: We do everything according to the Scripture and in a way that will not stumble anyone.
[173]  A worker of the Lord must also have a proper view and suitable resolution concerning the matter of virginity and marriage.
[174]  Paul had a clear word about the matter of virginity in 1 Corinthians 7:25-35: "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.
[175]  Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away.
[176]  Let us read again Matthew 19:10-12: "His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry.
[177]  And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
[178]  If we join the last part of verse 11 to the last part of verse 12, "Only to those to whom it has been given....He who can accept it, let him accept it," it will become clear to us that virginity is given to those who can accept it.
[179]  We should not go at length into the subject of virginity.
