   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 3:2-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1 discloses to us God's good pleasure in His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God desires to have a Body prepared for Christ to be the full expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He carries this out by dispensing His divine Trinity into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 2 shows us that God remade, re-created, regenerated, us by Christ passing through death and resurrection and entering into ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were dead persons, but in His death, resurrection, and ascension we have been remade, re-created.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this re-creation, we have been transferred out of our old realm and into a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been made a new man in God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This new man is God's family and God's kingdom, growing into God's temple and built up into a dwelling place for God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOD'S DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians 3 Paul unveils God's heart's desire from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 3 shows us that God, according to His heart's desire, made a plan, and this plan is His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's plan, or economy, is also His arrangement, His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This dispensation was hidden in God, who created all things, as a mystery until the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This hidden plan, this mystery, was revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit v. 5 . They received a revelation of this mystery, and they spoke concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Apostle Paul saw God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came to know this mystery, which is called the mystery of Christ because it is altogether concerning Christ v. 4 . The New Testament is a record of the New Testament ministry that has released what was hidden in God's heart to unveil the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we read the book of Ephesians, however, we may pick up outward matters such as husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not focus on "the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God" v. 9 . Our fellowship in this chapter may be considered as a master key to open the doors in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOD'S GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO DISPENSE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God desires to dispense His divine Trinity into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants to distribute the untraceable or unsearchable riches of Christ into us v. 8 . We can enjoy the riches of Christ by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first time I released a message on eating Jesus was in Taipei in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A brother who was a professor came to me after the meeting and told me that the expression eating Jesus was too wild and rough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I pointed this brother to the Lord's word in John 6:57 "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I told him that since the Lord Jesus said that we should eat Him, we must say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we live by Him whom we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As our spiritual food, He is unsearchably rich.</S>
