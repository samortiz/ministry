   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Thirty-five THE THREE DISPENSATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S DEALING WITH MAN Scripture: Acts 17:30-31 The first period God was overlooking In the first period, God allowed man to do whatever he wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems that God did not concern Himself too much with what man did.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was God s overlooking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This period was also the time of man s ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the gospel had not yet been preached, and because man was without the light of God s revelation, he was in ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prior to the gospel age God overlooked much and let man go his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second period God commands men to repent During the second period, God concerns Himself with what man does.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the period when God visits men, seeks men, and saves men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He commands all men to repent and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the beginning of the human race, the things concerning God were never preached in such a clear way until the gospel age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this period, God gives special revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the gospel He gives light to men that they may know God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So there can be no excuse for men not knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This period is called the gospel period.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During this time God s purpose is to save men, and God s work is to have the gospel preached that they may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in this period man should repent, believe, and receive God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third period God will judge men When the gospel period has passed, God will judge the whole world in the day which He has appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The future judgment will be according to God s righteousness as well as man s deeds or works.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But because by works no one is perfect, all will be condemned and the result will be eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While today God saves man through Jesus Christ, in the future God will judge man through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As He is the Savior today, so shall He be the Lord of Judgment in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man receives Christ today, to him Christ is a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man does not receive Christ today, he will still have to meet Him in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time Christ will be the Lord of Judgment to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sooner or later all men will face the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No man will be able to escape His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If today, under grace, you do not get involved with Him as your Savior, you will still have to get involved with Him that day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, He is your Savior; if not, in that day He will be your Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether He is your Savior or your Judge is not up to Him; it is up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You cannot avoid this decision; please make your decision now.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s saving way God raised Jesus from the dead; this is God s saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By Jesus death, man s sins are taken away, and by His resurrection, man may obtain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This eternal life is the very life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, as we are in the gospel period, those who do not believe in Jesus death and resurrection nor accept His salvation will come under His judgment in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a faithful saying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you receive the Lord Jesus you are not receiving a historical figure, but a living and real Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How do you know that Jesus died for sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because Jesus was resurrected!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus is not a dead historical figure, but a living and real Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He works miracles, brings men from darkness into light, makes the weak strong, turns the hearts of men, and hearkens to the prayers of men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these prove that Jesus is a living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Men receive God s salvation by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Believe that the Lord Jesus has died and resurrected to save you from sin and from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To believe you must first repent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the gospel period, God specifically wants men to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Repent and believe, and you will be saved, and will not be judged in that day.</S>
