   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JOHN TEN INTERPRETS JOHN NINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter 10 of the Gospel of John must be put together with chapter 9: these are not two separate records, but one record in two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter 10 the Lord Jesus said, "The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly" v. 10 . Many times we have quoted this verse in an isolated way, neglecting the context.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now, by putting these two chapters together, we see the way whereby the Lord imparts life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The blind man was there, a man made of mere clay.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord Jesus healed him and recovered his sight by emitting something out of His mouth and mingling it with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With such a strange kind of ointment, the man was anointed and healed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without chapter 10, it is rather difficult to understand the significance of the Lord's act in mingling the spittle with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter 10 interprets it by showing that in so doing He imparted life: something out from Him entered into the blind man and mingled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What the Lord did in chapter 9 was a sign, signifying a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus came to impart life to us by something coming out of His mouth and mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we come to chapter 20 of this Gospel, we see how the Lord Jesus after His resurrection came to His disciples and breathed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This breathing was in a sense a kind of spitting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Something came out of His mouth and entered into His disciples, mingling with them as with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is nothing else but something of the Lord Jesus breathed into us and mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is by the life then that we receive the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WAY TO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In what way could we have something coming out from the Lord and into us to mingle with us today?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In either of two ways: 1 By calling upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we call upon His name, we breathe Him in. 2 By pray-reading His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spittle today is the living Word, and we are the pieces of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we pray-read, the more something of the Lord Jesus comes out from Him and into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is thus that something of the Lord is mingled with us, and we not only have life, but have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is by this life, then, that we are enabled to see.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say that whenever I speak I always return eventually to the matter of calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is really so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have not found a third way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In all my years of experience with the Lord, I have only found these two ways: calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do know of a certainty that this is the best way for the Lord to mingle something of Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you realize that you are merely a piece of clay, born blind and kept in a fold?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If so, you must let Christ emit something out of Himself and into you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you will have life and receive the sight to see; you will be out of the fold and enjoy the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no other way but by calling on His name and pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the day we need to say, "O Lord, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O Lord, Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the day we also need to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the spittle from the mouth of the Lord will mingle with us the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will have the anointing, for this is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we call on the name of the Lord and pray-read the Word, the more we are anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This anointing is so sweet, so refreshing, so new.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by this that we experience Christ as the door, the Shepherd, and the green pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And it is by this that we are now in the flock, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually we have nothing and keep nothing but Christ and the Church, the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord in the last days of this age is recovering this; He is recovering Christ as life with the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now the Lord is doing something to put the enemy to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God the Father can point to the enemy and say, "Satan, look, even on this earth, in this dark age, My Son Jesus Christ could have such a Body."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only is this a shame to Satan, but also a beach head for Christ to gain the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church life will be the beachhead for Christ to return.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord is doing this, not in a human way, but in a divine way; not in an organized way, but by the transforming Spirit.</S>
