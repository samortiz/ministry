   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preserving the Consciousness of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Being Built Up in Our Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers need to learn the lesson of being broken, accommodating others, and respecting others function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Lord is great, and His work has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we must be faithful to what the Lord has entrusted us with and learn to work in coordination with others, respecting what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless they speak heresy, we should not interfere, intervene, or criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only in this way can we preserve the consciousness of the Body and produce the building among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seeds of these problems are sown among us and have already produced some negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we are serving the Lord together in His work and sharing this work together, we must rise up to utterly condemn such situations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These matters are intimately related to us and will manifest how much we have been dealt with before the Lord and the lessons of life we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have grown in life, been broken, and learned some lessons, we will be saved in all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the elders suggested studying the Gospel of John and the responsible brother for the home meeting said that it was too long, insisting that the elders accept his way, the feeling of coordination was weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the feeling of coordination is weakened, we cannot expect the building of the Body to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this brother continues to oppose the proposals of the elders, the brothers and sisters in his meeting will eventually rise up to oppose him, because he took the lead to oppose others and give his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he continues in this way, how can he lead the brothers and sisters in his home meeting to have a strong service in coordination and a good building?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to learn a serious lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the coordination of the Body, everyone needs to function and respect what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not criticize others but should join their labor so that the Body of Christ can be supplied, not damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way, the feeling of coordination in the Body will be sweet, and the building up of the Body will be strong.</S>
