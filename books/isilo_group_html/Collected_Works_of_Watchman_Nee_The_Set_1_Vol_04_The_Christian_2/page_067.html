Christ has died, and the veil is rent. Everyone can now come directly to God. The intermediary priesthood has forever been removed, for now every believer is a priest before God. Through the accomplishment of Christ every Christian has unconditionally become a priest (Rev. 1:6; 1 Pet. 2:5). Now our sacrifices are spiritual ones. Our thanksgiving and praises and our life and body are all spiritual sacrifices (Heb. 13:15-16; Rom. 12:1). Our priestly work is to offer up these sacrifices. Hence, every one of us can contact God directly. Let me repeat: in Judaism man could not draw near to God. Even the priests did not really draw near to Him. The common people were even farther away than the priests. Wherever you have the hierarchy of the priesthood, there you will find the same situation of estrangement. The whole congregation never had the opportunity to come near. The meaning of a priestly class is to estrange God and lock Him in obscurity. The Nicolaitans were those who had a clerical position. These clergymen were a special group of people distinct from the laity. They were the specialists in the holy things. They had special privileges and authorities in the divine things. They were a spiritual class, a special group of people who had the special right to lead others in spiritual things. They seemed to be closer to God than others, not through their distinctive spiritual power but through their position being above that of an ordinary believer. Under them were many common believers, whose position could never rival that of the clergy. The former were but common worldly ones who were like the Israelites of old, being in their position far away from God. Although the cross had drawn them close to God, the system of the Nicolaitans had annulled the function of the cross and had isolated God's children. The system of "priests" in the Roman Catholic Church and the system of "pastors" in the Protestant churches are but different manifestations of the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The pastoral system was actually an altered expression of the priestly system. If we admit the existence of the clerical class and deem that they should enjoy far more power and privileges than the common believers, when all the while the Scriptures never promise or ordain such, we are subscribing to nothing less than the teaching of the Nicolaitans! The center of the doctrine of the Nicolaitans is to have the common believers under the hand of a special group of people. The Nicolaitans are the ones who subdue the people! Where in the Bible does it say that Christians should obey a group of people with a special ministry? Surely there is none. Based on the New Testament, we can say that this matter was invented later by others. They only borrowed the Judaistic terms and used them for their own purposes. All those who take the Bible as the supreme law court should receive this light.</P><P>But where is the present day teaching of the Nicolaitans? The priests of the Roman Catholic Church naturally think that they are the priests of God. They stand between God and man and carry out ministries similar to those of the priests in the Old Testament. I am afraid many Protestants will think that their present pastors do not have as much priestly authority as the priests in the Roman Catholic Church. They are surely not wrong. We do not wish to engage in debates here. But for the sake of the churches' benefit in China, we can make one more observation which will help us to understand the situation and to realize whether or not our present system of pastors is in the nature of a priest that stands between God and man. What is a priest? A priest is one who comes to God on behalf of man. A priest is man's representative before God. He is one who stands between God and man, offering man's sacrifice for God and bringing it to God.</P><P>Praise and thanksgiving are the "spiritual sacrifices" that we the Christians as priests offer to God. If we set up another group of special people who officially and regularly offer the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving on behalf of all other Christians, then indeed we have an intermediary priesthood! These ones then become the mediators, for they become a special class of people who are closer to God positionally than other ordinary believers.</P><P>The Lord's supper is the highest expression of the Christian thanksgiving and worship. Do not many present Protestant pastors hold the administering of the Lord's supper as their exclusive and official right? Is it not true that so many common believers and even unordained preachers are afraid of administering the Lord's supper, thinking that to do so would be sacrilegious? This is the error caused by man's tradition and organization. They consider that except for the pastors, all Christians are but worldly people and are not worthy to execute the things of God. The professions of the common believers are in the world. Of course, they cannot be as spiritual as the clergy. For this reason, they should not touch the spiritual things. They can therefore be discharged from their spiritual responsibilities and can hand over all spiritual affairs to those who specialize in this work. However, the matter does not stop here. "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge" (Mal. 2:7). Since the ordinary believers have given up their priesthood, they naturally cannot retain their priestly knowledge. They consider themselves unworthy of taking care of the spiritual matters. As such, sooner or later they will lose their spiritual knowledge. At that time the special group of people will become the only ones who have the right to expound the Bible. They would argue that worldly ones are never able to know the Bible as well as the clergy. In this way, the clergy becomes the ears, the eyes, and the mouth of the common believers. Later, they go on further and replace the whole body of the believers!</P><P>This clerical group not only considers itself to have the special right to spiritual things and the exclusive power to administer the Lord's supper, but also considers itself to be the only group of people who can baptize others. However, there is no such teaching in the Bible. We have mentioned this in previous places already.</P><P>But why is the teaching of the Nicolaitans as prevalent in the church now as it was in the past? Why are the clerical ones so bold to uplift themselves, and why do the common believers think that they are different from the clergy? The biggest reason lies in the ritual of ordination. The clergymen think that they have been ordained and as such, they have the right to do something that ordinary believers cannot do. The common believers, on the other hand, consider that they have never been ordained and that too many things are too spiritual and holy for them to participate in.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
