   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>MEEK</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"A spirit of meekness" Gal 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a very important condition for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Meekness is the opposite of hardness and stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God requires a meek spirit of us.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A meek spirit is willing to be wronged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though one is protected by the law and able to take revenge, he would by no means use his fleshly arm to redress himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This spirit, though suffering pain and damage, causes no harm to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whoever has such a spirit conducts himself in righteousness but does not demand righteousness from others.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even when the flesh is most zealous, it can still be very lazy because it will only be zealous for the things which suit its will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Its zealousness is merely helped by emotion.</S>
