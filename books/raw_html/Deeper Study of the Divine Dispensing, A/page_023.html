<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RESULTS OF THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AS THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE IN THE BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The believers being saved in the life of Christ that they may reign in this life—Rom. 5:10, 17b:<br><br>Romans 5:10<br>For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.<br><br>Romans 5:17b<br>…much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers having been reconciled to God through the death of His Son being saved in His life—Rom. 5:10b:<br><br>	Romans 5:10b<br>	…having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be freed from the law of sin and of death—Rom. 8:2.<br><br>		Romans 8:2<br>		For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</li>		<li>To be saved from the body of this death—Rom. 7:24, cf. Rom. 7:9-13, 21-23.<br><br>		Romans 7:24<br>		Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?<br><br>		Romans 7:9-13<br>		For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. (10) And the commandment which was unto life, this was found to me to be unto death. (11) For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me. (12) So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good. (13) Did then that which is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me through that which is good; that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.<br><br>		Romans 7:21-23<br>		I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me. (22) For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, (23) but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members.</li>		<li>To be saved from the mortality of the body—Rom. 8:11, 13.<br><br>		Romans 8:11<br>		But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.<br><br>		Romans 8:13<br>		For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</li>		<li>To be saved from being common—Rom. 6:19, 22; 12:2a.<br><br>		Romans 6:19<br>		I speak humanly because of the weakness of your flesh. For as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.<br><br>		Romans 6:22<br>		But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.<br><br>		Romans 12:2a<br>		And do not be conformed to this age…</li>		<li>To be saved from a low manner of living—Rom. 12:9-21.<br><br>		Romans 12:9-21<br>		Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cleave to what is good. (10) Love one another warmly in brotherly love, vying with one another in showing honor, (11) not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave, (12) rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer, (13) communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality. (14) Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. (15) Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. (16) Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly. Do not be wise in yourselves, (17) repaying no one evil for evil, taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men, (18) if possible, as far as it depends on you, living in peace with all men, (19) not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to the wrath of God, for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. (20) But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head. (21) Do not be conquered by the evil, but conquer the evil with the good.</li>		<li>To be saved from division—Rom. 16:17.<br><br>		Romans 16:17<br>		Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The believers reigning in the life of Christ—Rom. 5:17b:<br><br>	Romans 5:17b<br>	…much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Subduing all the people, events, and things that oppose God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory—Rom. 1:17, 7; 3:23.<br><br>		Romans 1:17<br>		For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.<br><br>		Romans 1:7<br>		To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>		Romans 3:23<br>		For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;</li>		<li>Subduing God’s enemy, Satan—Rom. 16:20.<br><br>		Romans 16:20<br>		Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Amen.</li>		<li>Bringing in God’s kingdom—Rom. 14:17.<br><br>		Romans 14:17<br>		For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
