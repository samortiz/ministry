Y.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. Every time others asked whether I had sinned, I would answer proudly that I had never sinned. But a question remained in me: "What if I have sinned?" My older sister was the first in my family to believe in the Lord. Later I went and listened to the gospel myself and believed in the Lord that first day. On the same day I consecrated myself to the Lord. From that time onward, my life completely changed. I was like Mary who had chosen the best portion. I often got up in the middle of the night to pray. I studied medicine because even though there are many doctors in the world, I asked myself where I could find doctors who were spiritual. I began to preach the gospel almost every day, and I considered myself a spiritual doctor. I tired easily, but many people came to me for consultation, and I did not know what to do about it. Once I heard a voice which seemed to say, "Just follow the footsteps of the flock." Later I found the local church and was baptized into the Lord's name. I began to deal with my dress and my hairstyle. But I suffered persecution in the hospital. The sufferings I went through during that year were unprecedented in my whole life.</p><p>In 1942 I discovered that I had heart disease. The Lord told me, "I will be with you wherever you go." I could not believe this. He said again, "He who does not believe is condemned already." Later I met Brother Nee in Chungking. I asked him how one could hear God's word. He said that a proud person could never hear God's word. I realized that my service was only superficial. My attitude, words, and thoughts were all condemned by God. I felt that my walk and living before God were lifeless. Later I saw that I have died in Christ already and that I live in Him as well. If God wants to say something to me, I ask that He would be merciful to me and open my heart to receive it.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Being Self-conscious about Resurrection</h2><p>We do not have to lend a helping hand to resurrection. All we have to do is fall down before God, and we will find strength. God has His way of smiting man. While we are being smitten, we may think that everything is finished and gone because we do not see anything coming back to us. From our side, we feel that we are being stripped and emptied continually. But from the side of Aaron's rod, there is budding, blossoming, and even fruit-bearing. According to the type, all of these happen at night, while we are sleeping. The return of the power of resurrection is something that passes our feelings. When many people go through God's discipline, they try to engineer an artificial recovery. However, all they find is disappointment. We should only be conscious of our own weaknesses. We should not be conscious of any recovery or resurrection. Growth and resurrection are in God's hand; they are outside the realm of human consciousness. Parents cannot watch over their children constantly to see how many inches they have grown. Flowers will always blossom, but we do not know when they will blossom. The more thorough and strict God works on us, the better it is for us. We should not expect any conscious awareness of resurrection itself. The exceedingly great power of resurrection is upon us, but it must not remain in us only. The electricity in the wire is always flowing. As it flows, it lights the electric bulb. But as soon as the switch is turned off, the light goes out. The electricity is generated in the power plant and remains in the power plant, but it does not remain in the electric wire.</p><h2 class="head2">Death Being the Basis of Resurrection</h2><p>Resurrection life is a wonderful thing. No one can grasp resurrection. However, we always know when the Lord's cross is applied to us. As we move on in the way of discipline, we will experience resurrection. We should only be concerned about our own condition; we do not have to worry about how much resurrection we have received from the Lord. Silently and without our noticing it, resurrection will manifest itself in us. After God's dealing hand has been upon us for a while and we experience recovery and resurrection, we will find ourself being empowered. As we go on in this way, God will smite us until we become as good as dead. We will lose all hope, as if we are completely and totally dead. Then all the conditions for resurrection will be in place.</p><p>Before a man dies, he will hope for resurrection. He will want to receive power and grace. But death is the prerequisite to resurrection. We have to pray for light. As soon as light shines, we will see our own evil and weakness, and we will realize that we are useless, hopeless, and dead. Then we will experience resurrection. Therefore, when we are weak, we do not have to ask to be strong. When we are useless, we do not have to ask to be useful. When we are unclean, we do not have to ask to be holy. We only need to ask for light. Once light comes, we will be finished and dead. Then subconsciously God will bring resurrection to us.</p><p>Without death, there can be no resurrection. What a big contrast there is between death and resurrection! Suppose we have seen our own weaknesses. Having lost all hope, we will realize that we are evil beyond all hope, and we will not even expect any blessing. We no longer look for resurrection because we have lost all hope, even the hope of resurrection. Seemingly, this is a contradiction. Actually, this is the time we experience resurrection. We think that resurrection is something that God gives to us. This is why we look to God to somehow grant us resurrection in the midst of His dealings. We forget that resurrection is based on death; without death there is no resurrection. We can say that one prerequisite of resurrection is losing all hope. Another prerequisite of resurrection is extreme weakness. We have to remember that the seed of resurrection is planted in death. God takes care of resurrection; we only need to pray for light. All we have to do is see that we are weak beyond all hope. The most basic error that man commits is in hoping to be not as weak and corrupt as he is. He sees that he is poor, so he asks God for grace, for the power of recovery. But the more he does this, the less he dies. If he does not die, how can he be resurrected? Many people pray for recovery before they have even died. This is a big frustration. Everyone wants to climb up, but God wants to bring us down. The lower we go, the closer we are to death. As we take a step further towards death, we take a step further towards resurrection. Once we die, we resurrect. This is the way we touch resurrection. Those who try to climb up before they die are moving further and further from death. As a result they are also moving further and further from resurrection. The more they move, the less chance they have to experience resurrection.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
