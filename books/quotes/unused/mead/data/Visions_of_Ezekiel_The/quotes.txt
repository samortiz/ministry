[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the summer conference and training of 1971 in Los Angeles, California.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE A WORD OF INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[4]  1:1-3; Num 4:2-3; 1 Chron 23:3a; Luke 3:23a; Ezek.
[5]  The tree of life signifies God Himself as life to us in the form of food.
[6]  This is why the Lord Jesus told us in John 6 that He came as the bread of life, and that we should take Him as our food.
[7]  The Bible shows us clearly that God's eternal purpose and intention is to dispense Himself into us that we may have Him as our life and that we may have His very nature.
[8]  We must remember that both the Bible and the book of Ezekiel reveal that God's intention is just to dispense Himself into us as our life so that we may have His divine nature and that we may bear His glorious image.
[9]  The first section of Ezekiel, which is all of chapter one, presents a vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord.
[10]  In the second section, from chapter two through chapter thirty-two, God comes as the consuming fire to judge His people and the heathen nations.
[11]  Thus, Ezekiel begins with the appearance of the glory of the Lord and ends with the holy building of God.
[12]  In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him."
[13]  Thus, you can see that ten is composed of two times five, and this means that we are the creatures who have God added to us in order that we can bear responsibility.
[14]  Ezekiel not only said that it was the thirtieth year, but he also said that it was the fifth year.
[15]  The thirtieth year was counted from the year of his birth, but the fifth year was counted from the year of captivity.
[16]  We all must look to the Lord that He would grant us the maturity in life so that we may see the spiritual things, and that we may be able to accept, receive, and take in all the spiritual things.
[17]  Now we need to consider the person who saw the vision.
[18]  A priest is one who lives in the presence of God, serving God and mingling himself with God.
[19]  If you have the wind, surely you will have the cloud.
[20]  God's intention is not just to burn us and turn us into ashes.
[21]  In Genesis 1, He was solely God having nothing of the element of redemption within Him; but in Revelation He is the redeeming God, the Lamb-God.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[23]  1:5-6, 26; Rev 5:9b; John 5:25; Col 2:12-13; Phil 2:7-8; Mark 10:45; Rev 5:5; Exo 19:4; Isa 40:31; Phil 4:11-13
[24]  In our experience, God is like a blowing wind and like a cloud brooding, hovering, and overshadowing us.
[25]  These living creatures are not reckoned as individuals; they are counted as a group.
[26]  This means that we as the four living creatures are not only the unique expression of Christ, but also the complete expression of Christ.
[27]  The first face is the face of a man, because we ourselves are men.
[28]  Since we are men, we should look like men.
[29]  We need not only the face of a man and the face of a lion but also a third face, the face of an ox.
[30]  Though you may be always as bold as a lion in your office, that alone will never convince people.
[31]  If you are working in an office, and are on the one hand a proper man, on the other hand as bold as a lion, and you are also faithful in bearing responsibility, you will leave a good impression upon others.
[32]  Paul also said, "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" 1 Cor 15:10 .
[33]  Each of the four living creatures had four wings, two for covering and two for moving.
[34]  The grace, the power, and the strength of the Lord to us is not only for moving, but also for covering us.
[35]  The third aspect, the calf's hoofs, concerns our Christian walk.
[36]  We all must walk like a calf, having straight hoofs.
[37]  This proves that we need a walk that has been tested and burned by the Lord.
[38]  If in the church life we have been tested and examined by the Lord, our walk will be like shining brass giving light to others, shining on others, enlightening others, and testing others.
[39]  Then Ezekiel says that every one of the living creatures went straightforward.
[40]  We must also practice this kind of coordination in the meetings.
[41]  The result of the coordination of the four living creatures is that they become the burning coals.
[42]  Because they are coordinated as one, God comes in as the fire and they become the burning coals.
[43]  CHAPTER SIX THE HIGH AND DREADFUL WHEELS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[44]  After the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, the electrum, the four faces, the eagle's wings, the man's hands, the calf's hoofs, the burning coals, the burning torches, the divine fire going up and coming down, and the lightning flashing, there is something more.
[45]  When we are at home and we walk from the kitchen to our bedroom or to our living room, we do not need a wheel.
[46]  Not only does every proper local church need to have a wheel beside it, every proper individual believer must also have a wheel.
[47]  It may be that on your job you are not such a proper human being; you are somewhat worldly, and the move of the Lord is not with you.
[48]  All four wheels have the same appearance, the same likeness 1:16 .
[49]  This tells us that the move of the Lord has the same likeness and appearance whether it is through us, through the church in Los Angeles, through the church in Houston, through the church in Seattle, through the church in Chicago, through the church in Toronto, through the church in Cleveland, or through the church in any other place.
[50]  Ezekiel 1:16 says that the wheel looks like a wheel within a wheel.
[51]  When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and between these two are the spokes.
[52]  Remember, we must have the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum; we must be the living creatures with the four faces, with the eagle's wings, with the calf's hoofs, with the hands of a man, having the fire burning as the coals and as the torches, and we must be coordinated as one.
[53]  They tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament or the expanse which we call the sky.
[54]  When we were saved, not only did we receive a clear sky, but we also received an expanding sky.
[55]  We had the sensation that our sky was expanding.
[56]  After being saved for some time though, perhaps some problems arose with our relatives or with the church or with some of the brothers and sisters.
[57]  It was not as cloudy and as dark as before we were saved, but still it was not clear.
[58]  But as soon as we confessed our failures and applied His blood, condemning ourselves, our attitudes, our motives, and our intentions, right away the sky became clear once more.
[59]  When we as the living creatures reach this point, we have absolutely nothing between us and God.
[60]  This means that as they moved in such a coordination, a voice came out.
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[62]  In the last chapter we saw that above the heads of the living creatures there was a clear firmament, a clear sky, that was expanding and yet exceedingly stable.
[63]  Please remember that we Christians need to maintain a clear sky with the Lord, meaning that we need always to have a clear fellowship with the Lord.
[64]  If we would have a clear sky, a crystal heaven before the Lord, we must have a pure conscience, a conscience without any offense.
[65]  The living creatures are still on this earth, but through them the throne in the heavens is transmitted to the earth.
[66]  Whether brothers and sisters would listen to you or not depends upon where you are and what you are.
[67]  If you are under a clear sky, you do not need to argue; you do not need to claim anything; you do not need to say anything.
[68]  CHAPTER NINE THE MAN UPON THE THRONE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[69]  1:26-28; Exo 24:10; Gen 9:11-17; Rev 3:21; 4:2-3; 21:19-20; 22:1; Matt 26:64; Acts 2:36; Heb 2:10
[70]  I believe we all were impressed from the previous chapters that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it.
[71]  We all need such a life, a life with a clear sky which has the throne of the Lord in it.
[72]  To have a clear sky indicates that we have no clouds between us and the Lord.
[73]  It means that our conscience is void of offense we have nothing between us and God and nothing between us and others.
[74]  Have you ever considered that the Lord on the throne is not only the almighty God, but also a man?
[75]  Why does God want to bring us to the throne?
[76]  Satan intended to exalt his throne up to the heavens, but God said He would cast him to the ground and bring his captives to the throne.
[77]  God can never receive the full glory until we are brought to the throne.
[78]  As a result of having a clear sky with the throne and of experiencing a man who looks like electrum and like a consuming fire, we will have the appearance of a rainbow 1:28 .
[79]  This brightness signifies the splendor and glory around the Lord on the throne.
[80]  So God made a covenant with them and said that whenever there were clouds in the heavens there would also be a rainbow with them, signifying that there would be no more flood to destroy the earth Gen 9:11-17 .
[81]  His putting the people of Israel into the good land typifies that God has put us into Christ.
[82]  The situation today in Christianity is exactly the same.
[83]  Although the Christians in their standing are God's elect, they have become rebels against God.
[84]  If you do not love the Lord as much as you did when you were saved, it indicates you have an idol.
[85]  I am very happy that you are in the Lord's recovery today, but I am concerned that some of you may still have an idol within you, that you may still be associated with the world, and that in your daily walk, in your way of living, you are still after the manner of the heathen.
[86]  Within the nation of Israel, there were the priests, the kings, the prophets, the elders, and the people.
[87]  According to Ezekiel 22:26 the priests violated the Word of God and profaned the holy things.
[88]  CHAPTER ELEVEN GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[89]  First, we need to see the basis of God's judgment upon His people.
[90]  God's judgment upon His people was based upon three things: His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory.
[91]  In the first section of Ezekiel, in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things.
[92]  The righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God are the basic elements with which God exercised His judgment over His people.
[93]  When a church is filled with fighting the elders are fighting one another, the deacons are fighting against the elders, the sisters are fighting against the brothers, the brothers are fighting against the sisters, the older ones are criticizing and looking down on the younger ones, and the younger ones are fighting the older ones do you believe that in such a church there could be a rich supply of spiritual food?
[94]  As a result of God's judgment, the people of Israel first lost the good land.
[95]  If you have the glory of the Lord, you are right; if you do not have the glory of the Lord, you are wrong.
[96]  Before God sent fire to exercise His judgment, He sent His angel to mark out His seekers 9:4 .
[97]  God told His angel to mark them out so that they would not be killed by the sword, be affected by the pestilence, be devoured by any beast, or suffer the famine.
[98]  We should not say that they do not have the real presence of the Lord at all, but we must say that it is only a temporary sanctuary.
[99]  This means that while Ezekiel was prophesying and telling the people that God was going to burn the people of Israel, including the house of David, even denying the tribe of Judah, some of them made mirth saying, "We have Christ, we have the scepter of God's Son who despises and surpasses all the trees."
[100]  Thus, you can see while the judgment of God was on His people and while they experienced much disappointment, God prophesied that Christ was their hope and their encouragement.
[101]  CHAPTER TWELVE GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[102]  25:2-3, 7-8, 12-17; 26:2, 4, 19-20; 28:21-22, 24, 26; 29:3, 6-7, 16; 30:6, 10; 31:16, 18
[103]  We must remember that Ezekiel was not written merely for the sake of history.
[104]  Previously, we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beast is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves Ezek.
[105]  Some people on the earth, represented by the Ammonites, hate Christ, they hate the grace God gives in Christ, and they hate the church.
[106]  Like Ammon and Moab, Edom was also closely related to Israel.
[107]  According to the Bible, Egypt is a nation that does not depend upon God, but rather upon its own resources.
[108]  If we judge our old man, not caring whether we are first, second or last, not caring whether we are an elder or have any position, we will be so happy in the church life and our spirit will be very high.
[109]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN GOD'S RECOVERY BY LIFE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[110]  In the last chapter we saw that God's judgment was upon seven nations surrounding the nation of Israel.
[111]  No matter how much we say that we love the church, if we are attracted to the wealth and riches of the world, we will damage the church life.
[112]  After setting the watchman, God Himself came in to be the Shepherd.
[113]  After John the Baptist sounded the trumpet of repentance, the Lord Jesus also came in as the Shepherd Matt 9; Luke 15; John 10 .
[114]  In His recovery by life, God first sends the watchman to warn His people to repent, to turn and live.
[115]  At that time we realize that the Lord Jesus is not only our Savior but also our Shepherd, seeking and searching us out.
[116]  Then after we were saved, we backslid into poor Christianity, and were buried under many doctrines, forms, and gifts, but the Lord Jesus once more searched for us and eventually brought us out.
[117]  The Shepherd will also bind those who were broken, and He will strengthen and heal those who were sick 34:16 .
[118]  Frequently in the church meetings we have the sensation that we are under the tender binding of the Lord.
[119]  If you go to a local church where you have to be careful because the situation is touchy and you are afraid, that must not be a proper local church in the Lord's recovery.
[120]  Following this, in Ezekiel 35, the Lord reminded us once more of the need to condemn our old man, speaking a second time concerning the judgment of God upon Edom.
[121]  While you are in the enjoyment of Christ, he is still with you hating everything of God, God's Word, and God's people.
[122]  Not only has the Lord brought us back to the enjoyment of Christ, but He has also washed us.
[123]  The Lord Jesus washes us with His cleansing blood, not only when we are saved, but also every time we are revived and brought back to Him.
[124]  If we would contact the Lord, receive the Lord, take the Lord, enjoy the Lord, drink the Lord, and eat the Lord, we need a spirit.
[125]  The receiving spirit has been greatly neglected in Christianity.
[126]  In some places messages stirred up people's loving heart, but gave them no help how to exercise their spirit.
[127]  In His recovery we have seen that God has given us not only a new heart, but also a new spirit!
[128]  Furthermore, the Lord said that He would put His Spirit into their spirit 36:27 .
[129]  Not only would He give them a new heart and a new human spirit, He would put His own Spirit within them.
[130]  In Elden Hall we also prayed that the Lord would flock people in. We prayed, "Lord, bring flocks of men to us." The Lord really heard that prayer, and I feel that today we need to pray even more.
[131]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DRY BONES AND THE TWO STICKS Scripture Reading: Ezekiel 37:1-22
[132]  We have seen that Ezekiel 34 mainly covers the outward aspects of the Lord's recovery.
[133]  God came in as the Shepherd to search and seek for His people and to bring them back to the good land.
[134]  The Lord not only brings us back outwardly, but also regenerates us inwardly.
[135]  Not only were our position, our circumstances, and our surroundings changed, but we also had the inward renewing of a new heart, a new spirit, and we received the divine Spirit of God.
[136]  If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were evil, bad, sinful, dirty, and filthy, but we would never think that we were dead.
[137]  Three things were related to the prophesying: the wind, the breath, and the Spirit.
[138]  Although in English these are three different words, in Hebrew they are only one word, ruach.
[139]  Let me illustrate the difference to you in this way: when God blows upon you, that is the wind; when you breathe the wind, it is the breath; when it gets into you, it is the Spirit.
[140]  But when we come in and we make some noise, shouting joyfully to the Lord Jesus, calling on His name, praising His name, we are one!
[141]  In the second part of the chapter, the Lord told Ezekiel to pick up two sticks representing the northern and the southern kingdoms of Israel 37:16-17 .
[142]  We have seen in previous chapters the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life.
[143]  Ezekiel did not see the vision concerning the building of God in the land of captivity.
[144]  Rather, he was brought back to the holy land, to a high mountain, and to Jerusalem itself.
[145]  Many brothers and sisters can testify that while they were in captivity in the denominations, they could not see the vision of the building of the church.
[146]  But when they came back to the holy land, to the church life, they could see the vision of the building of the church.
[147]  In order to see something properly, we need the right position, we need the right standing, and we need the right angle.
[148]  The first item we need to see concerning the temple is the wall.
[149]  The wall is for separation, separating what belongs to God and what can never belong to God.
[150]  According to the measurement of the wall, we can realize that the wall is Christ Himself as a separating line.
[151]  If you are in the sphere of God's building today, it is because Christ as the gate has brought you in. Praise the Lord! Christ is our gate, our door John 10:9 . In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus said that He was the way.
[152]  By referring to the drawing of the gate, you can see that within the gate is the entry of the gate, which is exactly ten cubits wide.
[153]  It is meaningful that the opening of the entrance is ten cubits wide.
[154]  When we are faced with the Ten Commandments, we are excluded, but the Lord Jesus was able to fulfill every commandment and become the gate for us to enter into God's building.
[155]  All these numbers mean that the Lord Jesus, who fills all the requirements of the Ten Commandments, is the Triune God who became a man, was split put to death , and was resurrected.
[156]  From the guardrooms we go to the borders which the King James Version translates as the "space" and which some other versions translate as the "platform."
[157]  Outside each of the guardrooms is a border, a space, which is one cubit wide.
[158]  These are in two groups of three signifying the Triune God in resurrection.
[159]  Remember that the passage is ten cubits wide, meaning that the Ten Commandments are wholly fulfilled by the Lord Jesus.
[160]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE OUTER AND THE INNER COURTS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[161]  In the last chapter we saw that all the details related to the gates are very meaningful.
[162]  If we would enter the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision, we must first climb up the seven steps and then pass through the spacious gate.
[163]  This would bring us to the outer court of the temple.
[164]  Furthermore, attached to the enjoyment of Christ in the outer court were the four boiling places in the four corners.
[165]  This means that, by God's grace, the preparation of Christ for others to enjoy was spreading to every corner of the court.
[166]  We need to consider two other points before we come to the altar itself.
[167]  When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, it was not merely the death of one single person; it was the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures.
[168]  By the all-inclusive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, we were terminated and all the riches of God were released.
[169]  How can we prove from the account in Ezekiel that God and man and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?
[170]  How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death?
[171]  But I would like to declare to you that not only Christ, my Redeemer, and I died there, but also all the creatures and even God Himself died there.
[172]  Under the greater ledge is the lesser ledge, which also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of sixteen cubits wide.
[173]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE TEMPLE AND THE SIDE CHAMBERS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[174]  After we have passed the altar, which signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ, we come to the temple itself.
[175]  When we go from the street to the outer court, we must ascend seven steps higher; when we go from the outer court to the inner court, we must ascend another eight steps higher; when we go from the inner court into the temple, we must ascend an additional ten steps higher.
[176]  Having passed through the porch, we come to the outer temple where the entrance measures ten cubits 41:2 .
[177]  The beauty of the temple is in the side chambers.
[178]  If all the side chambers were removed, the temple would become too simple, having no beauty.
[179]  All these figures mean that we can only enjoy as much Christ as we have experienced and that we can only express as much Christ as we have enjoyed.
[180]  When we are really in the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and when we are really in resurrection, we express Christ with all our enjoyment of Christ.
[181]  In this chapter we need to cover the building which is at the back of the temple, the incense altar within the temple, the holy chambers on both sides of the temple, the two boiling places where the priests prepared the offerings, and the walls.
[182]  Let me illustrate: if I come to visit you and you do not have a room for me to stay in, but you ask me to sleep on your sofa in the living room, it indicates that you are not rich.
[183]  We offer something of Christ to God upon it, and God prepares something of Christ for us upon it.
[184]  Christ on the altar is the incense for God, and Christ on the altar is food for us.
[185]  The priests enjoy Christ, wear Christ, store Christ, and possess Christ to such an extent that the height of their chambers is the same as the side chambers, which signify the fullness of Christ.
[186]  At the end, toward the rear of the temple, there are the two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to prepare and bake the meal offerings 46:19-20 .
[187]  In his earlier ministry Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord leave the temple and the city, and in his later ministry he saw the glory coming back.
[188]  The glory of the Lord returned from the east, that is, from the direction of the sunrise 43:2 .
[189]  It is so wonderful that in the church in Los Angeles in the past years, we have had the sensation that the glory of the Lord has come back.
[190]  The gates on the south and the north are for the convenience of the people; but the gate toward the east is not only for the convenience of the people, but also for the glory of the Lord to come in. We should not care merely for the convenience of the people, we must care for the glory of the Lord.
[191]  Because He had lost His standing on the earth, He went back to the heavens.
[192]  In order for the Lord to come back to this earth, He needs a built-up church standing on this earth.
[193]  After pointing out these abominations, the Lord told Ezekiel how to instruct the people.
[194]  He did not tell Ezekiel to teach God's people concerning the law and the Ten Commandments as He had Moses.
[195]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE PRIESTS AND THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[196]  In the last chapter, we saw that God cares for His house.
[197]  In this chapter, we need to consider the kind of person who is qualified to serve in the house of the Lord, and we need to consider the offerings made to the Lord.
[198]  First, if we would serve the Lord in His house, the church, we need to be circumcised 44:9 .
[199]  You may be a real brother, but because you have not dealt with the flesh, with the old man, and with the natural man by the cross, the Lord regards you as a stranger.
[200]  How do the circumcised, faithful, and qualified persons serve the Lord?
[201]  The most precious part of the offering is the fat which typifies the precious Person of the Lord Jesus.
[202]  The fat we present to God is the precious Person of Christ, and the blood we present to God is the redemptive work of Christ.
[203]  Another item concerning the priests who came near to the Lord is their hair.
[204]  Finally, all the priests enjoyed the riches of Christ.
[205]  All the heave offerings, all the firstfruits, all the top produce of the people of the Lord belonged to the priests 44:29-30 .
[206]  They have God as their possession, and they have Christ in all His rich aspects as their enjoyment.
[207]  Moses told the people of the Lord to offer one lamb out of ten to God, but Ezekiel told them to offer one out of two hundred 45:15 .
[208]  This means that if you do not produce a large quantity of the enjoyment of Christ, you are not qualified to offer anything.
[209]  According to Ezekiel's record there was the yearly offering, the monthly offering, the weekly offering, and the daily offering.
[210]  The yearly offering was offered on the first day of the year signifying that, in principle, every year we should have a new beginning 45:18-19 .
[211]  During the night we had a thorough dealing with the Lord, confessing all our shortcomings, and during the early morning of the first day of the year, we consecrated ourselves freshly to the Lord.
[212]  Now we know what kind of priests we must be in order to serve the Lord, and now we know what we have to offer to the Lord.
[213]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE RIVER FLOWING OUT OF THE HOUSE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[214]  47:1-12; Psa 36:8; 46:4; Joel 3:18b; Zech 14:8a
[215]  Please notice that the flow is not in chapter one; in that chapter there was no flow, but there was the burning fire.
[216]  THE RIVER FLOWING BY THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
[217]  If there is no dealing of the cross, signified by the altar, the flow of the river will be frustrated.
[218]  To have the flowing of the river, we need the dealing of the cross.
[219]  If we are not willing to pass through the cross, we cannot expect that the flow will be prevailing within us.
[220]  How can we determine how much we have been measured and possessed by the Lord?
[221]  If the river is only up to our ankles or up to our knees, it proves we have not been measured fully by the Lord.
[222]  How deep the river is depends on how much we have been measured by the Lord.
[223]  According to the map the East Sea is the Salt Sea or the Dead Sea 47:8 .
[224]  By the flowing of the river out of the house, the salt water of the Dead Sea will be healed.
[225]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HOLY LAND AND THE HOLY CITY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[226]  45:1-8; 47:13-20; 48:1-35; Rev 21:12, 13 THE LAND
[227]  Although we may appreciate the temple very much, we have to realize that the temple is in the land, and without the land there could not be a temple.
[228]  The land, with all its riches, is called a land flowing with milk and honey 20:6 .
[229]  According to Ezekiel the whole land of Canaan was divided into three portions: the northern portion was for seven tribes 48:1-8 , the southern portion was for five tribes 48:23-27 , and the middle portion was an offering to God.
[230]  Because the Lord gave the people of Israel the whole land of Canaan as their possession, He asked them to heave the middle part back to Him as an offering.
[231]  The middle portion of the land was a heave offering, heaved up by the people to God 48:8-12 .
[232]  Both Ezekiel and Revelation end with a city, Jerusalem.
[233]  Only one city in the whole Bible has twelve gates with twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and that is the city of Jerusalem.
[234]  We must apply the things mentioned in Ezekiel to ourselves because eventually we will be that city.
