<p>Due to the Japanese invasion of China, many of us were scattered, and I realized that that work was not so profitable to the Lord’s recovery. Therefore, I changed my concept and I did not go out but stayed in my home town of Chefoo for approximately five years, from 1938 through 1943. This issued in a revival breaking out in Chefoo. Through all these experiences, we have learned much. Due to the political situation after the war, I could not stay in the north, so the brothers asked me to go to the south to stay with them in Nanking and in Shanghai. In Shanghai I met Brother Nee again and presented all that I had experienced and had seen to him, including the things concerning the practical church life. He absolutely confirmed the things I fellowshipped with him.<p>Because of such a successful practice of the church life in Chefoo and in Shanghai, I was fully occupied. I was in Shanghai less than two and a half years from the end of 1946 to the beginning of 1949. I mainly stayed in Shanghai and spent part of my time in Nanking. I was so occupied that I did not have any time to do any other work. I did not have the time to have any more contact with other Christians who did not meet with us. I was fully occupied with the preaching of the gospel, the teaching of the Bible, the edifying of the saints, and the building up of the church. In those two and a half years I was absolutely in the eldership even though I was not an elder. Even though I did not do everything myself, I also took care of the business affairs. I was fully occupied.<p>Then the political situation changed and that forced us to leave mainland China and go to Taiwan. When we arrived in Taiwan, we began a work which was very much blessed by the Lord, so, again I was more than occupied. Quite often I also went to the Philippines from Taiwan. I spent approximately two-thirds of my time in Taiwan and the rest of my time in the Philippines. From 1950 I began to publish the Chinese magazine—The Ministry of the Word. This magazine has continued to be published up to the present time. In those early days, I myself composed the articles or rewrote the messages I gave to place in this magazine. I also received a little help from the brothers to write some articles on church history and some gospel messages. This shows again that I was fully occupied.<p>This does not mean that I had no intention of going out to contact Christians; I just did not have the time. Once there was a ladies’ prayer meeting in Taipei. Most of those ladies were wives of the high officials in the government. The leader of this group was the wife of the president. I was invited to speak to this group twice. In their prayer, they cried to the Lord sincerely. They confessed their sins, they asked for the Lord’s mercy, and they prayed for the island of Taiwan. After their prayer, I spoke to them. Due to the fact that I was so busy, this was one of the few times that I went to speak to a group of Christians who did not meet with us. Even this, however, shows strongly that we did not cut ourselves off from other Christians, nor did we cut them off.<p>Some people may ask, “Why wouldn’t you be one with them?” Actually, however, we are really one with them in Christ. Because of the divisions, organizations, and traditions, we have no way to be practically one with them. Also, because we have seen the vision of the type in the Old Testament concerning the remnant of God’s people bearing God’s testimony, we cannot go back to captivity in order to join our dear brothers who are still there in captivity. What we can do and what we expect is that many of the Lord’s children will take His Word, leave their captivity, and come back to join us. Then we will rejoice with them. This is our standing, this is our situation, and this is our attitude.<p>We do not deny that there are thousands and thousands of genuine believers scattered among all the denominations; we love them and we would like to share all the truths we have received from the Lord with them, if they would be open. While I was traveling in northern China in 1937, all the denominations were open to me. The China Inland Mission churches were especially open. I had my first study of the book of Hebrews with them based upon Andrew Murray’s book The Holy of Holies. I was also welcome among the Presbyterians, the Southern Baptists, and the Episcopalians. They were all open to me. Even today I am occupied greatly with the ministry for the churches. However, if the denominations would open to me, I would spare some time to go and share with them the truths the Lord has revealed to us. We are not sectarian nor narrow-minded, but regretfully, they would not open to us.<p>We surely recognize that all the genuine believers are our brothers and sisters in the Lord. Also, we fully admit that we are not the only members of the Body of Christ. We are just a small part, just as the returned captives in the Old Testament were just a small remnant of all of the chosen people of God. In addition, we are open to all the dear Christians. If time allowed and if they were open to us, I would take the lead to go and share the truth with them. We do love all the Lord’s children and like to share with them all the truths that we have received of the Lord and that we have experienced and enjoyed.<p>Some may ask, “Why don’t you invite others to come to your meetings to speak?” We did this in the past. One particular brother shared my training for a number of weeks. I asked him to speak every day. This shows that we are open to others. Also, on the island of Taiwan I wrote a letter of invitation to T. Austin-Sparks in London and he came to visit us twice. We stopped inviting him, however, because in his second visit he tried to tear down the ground of our work, which is the unique ground of the oneness of the church practice.<p>Our attitude is that we are open to all the saints. We do not consider that we only are the members of the Body of Christ. The most we consider is that we are members of the Body of Christ who have come back to the original, unique ground of oneness and who are standing here as God’s remnant. The difference between other Christians and us is that they still remain there in their captivity, while we have come back to the proper, unique ground of oneness. We are open to all the believers, but we would not take the place of captivity where they remain. We could not join them in that place because it is a place of captivity, full of divisions, organizations, and traditions.
