   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Then another Hebrew will hear about what we are doing, and he will decide to gather some of his neighbors to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, the people of Israel will be automatically and spontaneously divided, and there will be no end to their divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, God did not allow this for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were regulated strictly by God in their worship to Him; three times a year they had to go to worship God in the place which God chose Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they offered their offerings in other places, that would be considered sinful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to apply this type to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The place of oneness is the unique ground or standing of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you go to any city, you do not have the freedom to set up any meeting you like for the worship or service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to be limited, ruled, and regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason why many people do not feel happy to talk about the church life, because with the church life there is limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we talk about our personal enjoyment of Christ, everything is so nice because we are absolutely free to enjoy Him wherever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord is the Spirit, who is everywhere, so we can enjoy Him without any limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But do you think that as Christians we have the liberty to do whatever we like in our worship to God in the enjoyment of Christ in fellowship with others?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the misuse of freedom in the church's history.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems today that it is easy for any Christian to set up a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you can come to Los Angeles to set up a meeting, so can I. You and I, however, need to consider that if we do this, we just bring in more divisions and thereby damage the oneness of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose a brother who is of the tribe of Benjamin has been offended by a brother who is of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Feast of Tabernacles comes, the brother from the tribe of Benjamin does not feel happy about going to Jerusalem since the brother who has offended him is also going there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What can the Benjaminite do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can he set up an altar on his farm and offer his tithes and burnt offerings there?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The answer, of course, is no. Here is a picture of the test to the flesh and to the natural intention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is the need of the application of the cross to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But look at the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When people cannot get along with others or do not feel happy about one another, they just set up different meetings according to their taste or preference.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where is the limitation to the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is the regulation to the natural man?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is nothing limiting or regulating people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every man does whatever is right in his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone can offer his burnt offerings in any place he chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So the oneness of the people of God is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, there are all kinds of complications and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to have a real repentance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do we really know the right ground for the children of God to worship God with Christ in the fellowship with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be more liberal than what has been ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why many times, by the mercy of the Lord, I have declared to the Lord's children that they have no right to form anything, to start anything, according to their own convenience and preference.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only one proper ground for the Lord's children to share Christ with one another in fellowship as a worship to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That proper ground is the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose you come to Los Angeles, and there is already a group of believers meeting together on the proper ground in worshipping God and in fellowshipping with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you do not have the freedom to set up another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to submit to them because there is only one ground of oneness, one place ordained, appointed, by God for His people to worship Him and share His Christ in fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you start another meeting according to what you prefer, you simply break the regulation, the rule, of the oneness of the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the history of the Jewish nation, there was a person who did this thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His name was Jeroboam.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jeroboam not only divided the nation but also tried his best to divide the people's worship to God 1 Kings 12:20-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this he damaged the oneness of God's people and brought in a great curse from God 14:6-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the practice of the church life, we need to learn to take care of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we give up the ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ, there is no need for us to talk about the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do whatever is right in our eyes, any talk about the church life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we mean business to practice the church life, we have to make a definite decision concerning the proper ground of oneness.</S>
