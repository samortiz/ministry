<h1 class="title">PROPHESYING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:26, 3-5, 24-25, 31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="3">
<li>Without the fulfillment of Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord cannot return:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The organic building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ must be accomplished (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12, l6).</li>
	<li>The church as the bride must be prepared for Christ as the Bridegroom (Rev. 19:7-9).</li>
	<li>In the Gospels, the only clear word concerning the building up of the church is in Matthew 16:18; in the Epistles, 1 Corinthians and Ephesians are the two particular books on the building up of the church as the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Matthew 16:18 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation of Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26.</li>
		<li>On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:26 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation in Ephesians 4:11-16; on the other hand, unless the meetings of mutuality as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 are recovered in the practice of the church life, it is impossible to practice the building up of the Body of Christ as recorded in Ephesians 4:11-16.</li>
		<li>When all function in mutuality, as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 4:16 is fulfilled as the joints supply the Body richly and each one part operates according to its measure for the building up of the Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When we enter into the practice of the truth revealed in Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord will have a way to work out His New Testament economy to recover the organic building up of the church and to prepare the bride for Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians 4:11-16 tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is not built up by the gifted persons directly; their work is to perfect the saints so that the saints can directly build up the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals three levels of building:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ, the Head of His Body, builds up the Body (Matt. 16:18) by giving gifted persons as the joints to the Body (Eph. 4:11, 16).</li>
			<li>The gifted persons perfect the saints, each one part of the Body of Christ, to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).</li>
			<li>Each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly (4:16).</li>
			<li>By practicing Ephesians 4:11-16, every brother and sister will be perfected and they, in turn, will perfect others; in this way the Body of Christ will be built up through the members&rsquo; growth in life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The main thing Ephesians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26 reveal is the proper church meeting for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ; this has to be fulfilled, and this fulfillment is a great part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to have meetings as described by Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</li>
			<li>When all the saints have something of Christ to offer by prophesying in the church meeting (1 Cor. 14:24, 31) according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 4:16 will be fulfilled.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By this scriptural way, each one of us will be built up organically and the Lord will have something built up on this earth as His Body to be His bride so that He can come back.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>First Corinthians 14:26 reveals that the church meetings should be full of mutuality for building up; in the church meetings we should have mutual speaking, mutual listening, and mutual building up:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whether we are building an organized congregation or building up the church as an organism has much to do with the way we meet.:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 develops the spiritual, organic function of the saints.</li>
			<li>There is no need to keep the old way of meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The old way is according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8 NASB); it is worldly and natural.</li>
				<li>2) The old way deadens and kills the organic function of the saints.</li>
				<li>3) The old way has become a deeply rooted habit that must be overthrown; to overcome, because of the pressure of the traditional thought, we have to push against it meeting after meeting.</li>
				<li>4) One person&rsquo;s speaking, although he may be capable and his content rich, can never be as rich in content as many saints speaking the riches of Christ in many aspects and from many directions.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s demand today is that the meetings in mutuality as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14:26 be recovered; to prophesy is the top way and the unique way to have a church meeting full of mutuality (1 Cor 14:12, 31).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must endeavor to do everything we can to go along with the Lord for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First Corinthians 14:26 is the Lord&rsquo;s word and His word must be fulfilled.</li>
			<li>We believe that today is the time to cooperate with him and labor with Him, so that we can be a channel for Him to fulfill His word in this verse.</li>
			<li>Because this way of meeting as described in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is ordained of God and is according to the Scriptures, we have to practice it at any cost; we all should press on faithfully to recover this verse.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall by no means pass away&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:35.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If 1 Corinthians 14:26 cannot be realized, how can the Body of Christ be built up?</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>First Corinthians reveals that the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ (1:2, 9, 24, 30; 5:7-8; 10:3-4, 16-17; 12:13; 15:45) will issue in three things:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The solving of the problems in the church through the work of the cross (1:13a, 18, 23-24; 2:2).</li>
	<li>The growth in life producing the precious materials for the building up of the church (3:6, 9-14).</li>
	<li>The developing of the believers&rsquo; gifts by the growth in life for functioning to build up the Body of Christ (1:7; 12:1-11, 31; 14:1), prophesying being the top development of saints&rsquo; gifts and the highest function for the building up of the church (14:3-5, 12):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To build anything you need firstly the materials and secondly the skill, the functioning.</li>
		<li>The enjoyment of Christ in 1 Corinthians eventually consummates in the building up of the church by prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul taught the crucial practice of prophesying to the church in Ephesus and to the church in Corinth before writing 1 Corinthians:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus while he was teaching the saints in Ephesus (1 Cor.16:8).</li>
	<li>In Acts 20 we see that Paul taught the church in Ephesus everything that was profitable, even the whole counsel of God (vv. 20, 27); when Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20) in Ephesus he surely instructed them in the matter of prophesying.</li>
	<li>If Paul had not taught in Corinth the matter of prophesying prior to writing 1 Corinthians 14 the Corinthians would not have known the term <em>prophesying</em> (v. 1).</li>
	</ol></li>
