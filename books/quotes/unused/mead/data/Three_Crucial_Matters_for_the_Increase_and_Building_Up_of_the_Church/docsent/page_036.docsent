   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THE SAINTS COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The newly baptized brothers and sisters will come to the meeting halls to meet with everyone one Lord s Day every month.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hope that the responsibility for the home meetings will be transferred from the full-time trainees to the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two ways to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the meeting halls can coordinate with the training center so that the local brothers and sisters can go with the trainees to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way the brothers and sisters will see what the trainees are doing, and they will meet the new ones in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, the full-time trainees who are more experienced can make arrangements to visit the meeting halls to promote the matter of caring for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders in each meeting hall should work together so that the main responsibility for the home meetings will be quickly transferred from the trainees to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we all rise up to receive this burden by consecrating every Lord s Day plus two or three evenings a week to the Lord, we will be able to take this burden and see the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The new way is becoming clearer as we practice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we lead a person to salvation, we must immediately establish a home meeting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most important thing in the home meetings is to supply the new ones with the word and to teach them Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The brothers and sisters might not do this as well as the full-time trainees, but as long they do it according to the fellowship, they will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything needs practice; if we do not practice, we will not improve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elderly brothers and sisters should pray for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rest of the saints should fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>LEADING THE NEW ONES FROM HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>TO DISTRICT MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are now three thousand five hundred people meeting in the church in Taipei, of which one thousand five hundred go door-knocking and are in home meetings with the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two thousand saints meet regularly in the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We fellowshipped with the elders concerning the need to strengthen the meetings for Truth Lessons and the Lord s table meeting held in the halls on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to strengthen the prayer meetings and the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of these meetings are for fighting the battle, and other meetings are for defending what is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must establish home meetings in the homes of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then when the time is right, we should bring two or three home meetings together for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There might even be the need for a new district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Several groups can come together and find a large building within their district to use as a central meeting place for that district.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can also have joint meetings in the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually the Lord will give us a large meeting hall so that once a month we can all meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord gives us 80,000 or 100,000 brothers and sisters in the church, and the large meeting hall can only seat 20,000, we can take turns using the large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the first session can use the hall from 8:00 to 10:00 on the Lord s Day morning, and the second session, from 10:00 to 12:00.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There can be a session in the afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00 and another from 4:00 to 6:00.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There can also be a session from 7:00 to 9:00 in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If every session has 20,000 people, we can handle 100,000 people in five sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there are more people, we can have another session on Friday night.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can also use the large meeting hall every day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meeting halls can arrange their meeting times so that the saints can meet together frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BEING IN ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not rely merely on the speaking brothers; rather, we must all rise up and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to my calculations, if we all rise up, in less than ten years all the people on the island of Taiwan will be our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not such a glorious situation will come to pass depends entirely on us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we work together, we will be successful, and the result will be pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the saints in the Lord s recovery will promote door-knocking and the home meetings, we will eventually knock on every door on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We believe that this way will bring the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the whole inhabited earth before the end will come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no other way to preach the gospel to the whole inhabited earth apart from knocking on people s doors and having home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of the new ones testified that they began to knock on doors after they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some are even attending the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This proves that if we work faithfully, the children we beget will be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though it is somewhat more difficult for those who are pioneering the new way, the ones we bring to the Lord will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will be Christians who knock on doors, have home meetings, teach Life Lessons, sing hymns, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we were to hire preachers, we would not be able to hire enough preachers to meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if we were able to find enough preachers, they would kill everyone s function.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot continue the method of Christianity and hold big gospel campaigns, because that method does not beget many spiritual descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though our way appears to be very slow and difficult, a great deal can be accomplished by taking small steps.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If all the saints coordinate together through prayer, knocking on doors, and leading the home meetings, in a few years Taiwan will be gospelized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether we are successful in gospelizing Taiwan depends on our willingness to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we are willing to pray, confess our sins, deal with the natural man and our flesh, be filled with the Spirit, and go door-knocking according to the methods of the training, we will gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If one thousand five hundred saints bring one person to salvation every day, in one month we will gain forty-five thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, we must still take care of our families, our jobs, and our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we do not lack clothing, food, and the necessities of life, our needs are taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not be too rich or too poor in our outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should be neat and proper so that people do not pity us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should give our children a proper education and care for our households.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After caring for these things, we should give whatever time and money we have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This does not mean that all the saints should drop their jobs and serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The elders do not need to be full time; on the contrary, they should take good care of their professions, manage their households well, and care for their own children.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, they must give every Lord s Day and two or three evenings per week to the Lord to knock on doors and be in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The young people should not think that they will ruin their future by giving themselves to the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If they use their time well, they will do well in their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are many testimonies that prove that young people who love the Lord in this way will be top students.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must live a balanced life before the Lord and make a budget.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should budget our money, and we should also budget our time and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the elderly saints do not budget their strength, they will not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I also budget my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we live this kind of life, people outside the church will know that our speech is not common, our clothing is proper, and our homes are furnished simply and elegantly without being luxurious and wasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The new way is practical, and it enables us to receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our society and our country will also be blessed by it.</S>
