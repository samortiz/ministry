<p class="bold">WEEK 17 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 24:6-9, 14</h2><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;And you will be hearing of <sup>1</sup>wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the <sup>2</sup>end is not yet.</p> <p class="bold">7 &nbsp;For <sup>1</sup>nation will rise up against nation, and <sup>1</sup>kingdom against kingdom; and there will be <sup>2</sup>famines and <sup>3</sup>earthquakes in various places.</p> <p class="bold">8 &nbsp;All these things are the beginning of <sup>1</sup>birth pangs.</p><p>9 &nbsp;Then they will deliver <sup>1</sup>you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name.</p><p class="bold">14 &nbsp;And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>6<sup>1</sup> Wars here denotes all the wars from the first century to the present. They are signified by the red horse of the second seal in Rev. 6:3-4.</p><p>6<sup>2</sup> The end denotes the consummation of this age (v. 3; Dan. 12:4, 9, 6-7), which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation. Although vv. 6-9 and 14 are in the section concerning Israel, the tribulations and the preaching of the gospel mentioned in these verses take place generally, in the whole world, from the time of Christ’s ascension to the end of this age. Verse 15, immediately following v. 14, speaks concerning the beginning of the great tribulation (v. 21), which is the time when Antichrist will set up his image in the temple of God, which image will thereby become the abomination of desolation.</p><p>7<sup>1</sup> Nation denotes the people, the Gentiles; kingdom denotes an empire.</p><p>7<sup>2</sup> Famines issue mainly from war. According to history, war has often brought famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in Rev. 6:5-6.</p><p>7<sup>3</sup> Since Christ’s ascension, earthquakes have been occurring throughout all the centuries and will be intensified at the end of this age (Rev. 6:12; 8:5; 11:13, 19; 16:18).</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> Birth pangs are for the bringing forth of a child. In His New Testament economy, God’s desire and purpose are to bring forth many sons (Gal. 3:26; Heb. 2:10) as His expression. Hence, birth pangs here refers to all the tribulations in the New Testament age, including wars, famines, earthquakes, afflictions, and persecutions, as mentioned in vv. 6-9 and 21. The birth pangs here are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord’s sake, whereas the travailing in birth in Rev. 12:2 refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God’s people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel (v. 14), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future. Galatians 4:19 and Rev. 12:2 and 5 confirm this viewpoint.</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> Referring to the Jewish disciples, who were the prophets and wise men sent to the Jews (23:34).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The gospel of the kingdom, which includes the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), brings people not only into God’s salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 1:9). The gospel of grace emphasizes forgiveness of sin, God’s redemption, and eternal life, whereas the gospel of the kingdom emphasizes the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord. This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age. Hence, that preaching, signified by the white horse of the first seal in Revelation 6:1-2, will be a sign of the consummation of this age. The gospel of the kingdom is a testimony to all the nations (Gentiles). This testimony must spread to the whole earth before the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.
