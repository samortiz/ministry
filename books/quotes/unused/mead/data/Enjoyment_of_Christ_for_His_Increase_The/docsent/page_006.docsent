   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF ABIDING IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to put this matter into practice, we need to know the secret of maintaining our abiding in Him and His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First of all, we need to have the revelation that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would even suggest that we place these two words in Christ in a frame and hang it on our wall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are now in Christ, but do we have the full realization that we are in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the intention to abide in Christ, the first thing we need to see is that we are already in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you ask me where I am right now, I will tell you that I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not merely in Seattle or Sacramento or San Francisco; I am a person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we are branches of Christ, we are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this universe there is such a vine, and each of us is one of His branches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we see this, we will be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will be crazy, telling everyone that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a small matter to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day I do believe and expect that many of us will see the revelation that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we see this, we will be so joyous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may feel that even the universe is too small for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will be so excited that we will run to tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a glorious thing to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we maintain our standing and position in Christ, we will enjoy the constant flowing of the life of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will continually remain in fellowship with Christ, who is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will always have His presence and smiling face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, whenever we discover a problem between us and Christ, we should go to Him right away and open to Him, telling Him, Lord, there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similarly, whenever we intend to do something, we have to speak to the Lord first concerning what we intend to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are going to lose our temper, we need to tell the Lord, Lord, I am going to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to speak to Him again and again, not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our speaking to Him is just like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not breathe once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even when we are sleeping, we are still breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither can we graduate from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may graduate from a school after four years of study, but we cannot graduate from eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we graduate, we will die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot graduate from life; we must continue in life matters all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as a light switch is on, we have light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever it is off, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may have the idea that the Lord wants to give us a big battery so that one empowering from Him will last us for at least three years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord will never give us such a battery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He desires to be like a current of electricity that is transmitted into us time and time again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to switch on and always keep ourselves in contact with Him so that we may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we realize that there is insulation between us and the Lord, we have to go to Him and ask Him what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The secret to being a living Christian is not merely to listen to messages, learn doctrines, or gain knowledge in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The secret is to practice staying in contact with Christ continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the vine, and we are one of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to practice abiding in Him and always maintain the sense of life within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can make sure that a current of life is flowing within us all the time by keeping a sweet fellowship between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will learn to sense His presence within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then, whatever we do, whatever we speak, and wherever we go, we will maintain His smiling presence by the flow of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a proof that we are abiding in Him and He is abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we rise up every morning, there is no need to go to Him to pray for so many things, asking Him for help to do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first thing that we should take care of in the morning is to go to the Lord to be nourished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even to sustain our physical body, the first thing we should have every morning is a nourishing breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In principle it is the same for our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each day in the morning we should speak to Christ, saying, Lord, now I come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are my table.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are my feast, and You are my breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to feed on You and drink of You.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise You that You are my life, my food, and my daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will take care of everything that we need, for He knows what we need better than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, to ask Him to do this and that for us is not only wrong but foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many sisters are too worried about their husbands and their children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This occupies their prayer time very much, so that when they pray, they ask the Lord to take care of their husbands and children and to protect them from accidents.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Other sisters pray earnestly about being a good mother and a good wife, asking the Lord for help and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord surely knows how to take care of our husband and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should just praise Him and look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By eating Him, contacting Him, and enjoying Him, we will be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will fill us with joy, peace, energy, and His refreshing life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then all day we will be persons full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At noontime when you feel that you need lunch, go to the Lord again, saying, Lord, it is time for me to come to You again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am coming to You to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Look to the Lord, wait on Him, and take Him into you as your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will be refreshed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>During the evening time you can go to Him yet a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may say, Lord, now it is dinner time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the third meal of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I can still take something more of You into me as food.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we enjoy the Lord day by day in such a way, we will see what kind of powerful Christians we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will accomplish many things without any self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The issue will be the overflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We will bear fruit again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope that we will have a change in our way of being Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not the way of knowledge, teaching, doctrine, work, or toil but the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must give up all of the other ways and take the way of life, realizing that the Triune God is everything to us in Christ and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then Christ will be our life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This very Christ now indwells us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to realize this glorious fact and take it by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Learn to always stay in contact with this living person, who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then we will surely grow up and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>May the Lord be gracious to us in such a way.</S>
