   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Love of Material Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth expression of the self is a love for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people not only love themselves; they love material things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such ones are not yet delivered from the material world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, some people love food, money, or other things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These things are their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If someone breaks a favorite glass by accident or damages their treasures, they become very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their love for material things is wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man's love for material things is not dealt with, his temper will always remain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that a man loses his temper easily has nothing to do with other people; it has to do with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Lawrence once slapped his hand on a piece of wood, then on some glass, and then on the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He used the same hand to hit three different things, and the sounds produced were all different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He pointed out that the difference in sound was not due to the hand, but to the different kinds of materials hit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same can be said about man's temper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not flare up because of the environment but because of the very nature within man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The environment only brings out the temper that is already within him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man does not deal with his self but only tries to deal with his temper, he is a foolish man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will never be able to deal with his temper because he is only dealing with the symptom of his sickness; he has not touched the root of his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE ROOT OF TEMPER</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that temper is not an illness but a symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet from the symptoms, we often can diagnose an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a man loses his temper, it means that there is something abnormal in him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are four reasons for a Christian to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, a person who refuses the discipline of the Holy Spirit loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A man with a temper complains and gets angry when he faces adversity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only is he short of light from God, but he blames others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit which is placed in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, a person loses his temper because he is dissatisfied with God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A man with a temper often is a man who is dissatisfied with his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter what God does to his environment, he is always dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He always wants more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, a Christian loses his temper because he only cares for his own things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people are quiet by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are only interested in their own things, and they have no interest in others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything they do is for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have no time for others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When others come, they feel bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If their work takes up too much time, they become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They cannot stand others' bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When others bother them, they condemn them and say that they are infringing on their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people lose their temper because they care only for their own things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we should tell new ones that the root of all temper is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fourth, a man loses his temper because of self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people become mad and angry as a result of their struggle to exalt themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They think that others should not be the same as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They want to have everything for themselves and nothing for others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are always jealous of others, not only in material things but in spiritual things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they see others achieving something, they become jealous and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a very mean attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have the same kind of feelings as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They rejoice in the fall of those whom they dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are sympathizers of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such ones are filled with jealousy in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to be delivered from their anger, they must remove jealousy from their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When a man who knows God is exalted, he rejoices at others' exaltation as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He will not trample upon others or debase others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>LEARNING TO ACCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Temper comes from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a man has a temper, it is because his self is not dealt with one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to learn to prostrate ourselves before God and be open to His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should consider our own condition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every day many things come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should bow our heads and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are always the best."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many cows and sheep are nervous under the hand of their shepherd because they do not know their master; they only see the rod and staff of the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we only see the environment without seeing the Lord behind the environment, we will not be at peace, and we will easily lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if we see that every situation is in our Shepherd's hand, having been measured by Him, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we accept the Holy Spirit's discipline and God's arrangements, every negative problem will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When temper tries to flare up, we will isolate the self and find deliverance in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way we will be able to rise to our feet quickly.</S>
