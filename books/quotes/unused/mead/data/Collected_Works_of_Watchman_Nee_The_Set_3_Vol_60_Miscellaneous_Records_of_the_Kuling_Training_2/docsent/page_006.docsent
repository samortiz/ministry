   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 4 Date: July 26, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN LISTENING TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: What are the particular things we have to know concerning listening to others?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: Whether or not we can listen to others depends mainly on our objectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only those who are objective can "translate," rather than "interpret," what they hear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be objective, the self has to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once the self is dealt with, we become objective.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only an objective person can listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once a man becomes subjective in his attitude, he is useless in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A subjective person cannot listen to what others have to say, much less listen to what God has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The basic requirement for listening to others is to be objective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A lazy person is useless in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So is a subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same basic requirement holds true in understanding God's word one must not be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kind of person we are will determine the kind of "word" we get.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a man becomes subjective, he will read his own thoughts into God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only an objective person will find God's will in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No subjective person will truly understand others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose three or five persons with a similar frame of mind are together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a subjective person joins them, he may indulge in a self-centered discourse to the neglect of the others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a person lives in the realm of his own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He cannot touch others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An objective person, however, would first touch others' feelings; he would easily blend in with their feelings and be one with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A subjective person can never catch up with others' spirit or enter others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He cannot touch God's word, because he cares only for his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is insensitive to the feeling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A subjective person only cares about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wants to subject others' feelings to his own.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Problems arise when a subjective person takes control, because others' feelings are always trampled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The main reason for subjectivity is an unbroken self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All subjective persons are audacious, and all of them are short of spiritual knowledge before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A subjective person only sees himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not know how high the sky is or how great the earth is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A subjective person must be thoroughly broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not easy for a worker of the Lord to make judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to pray and consider much before we can make a small decision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man can make a decision within five minutes, it means that he is a very subjective person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to deal with a situation, we have to build up some history behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, we cannot deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, the disciples once asked the Lord the reason they could not cast out a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord answered that the kind of demon in question could only be cast out through fasting and prayer Matt 17:19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet the Lord cast out the demon immediately, indicating that the Lord Himself was well prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a basic requirement for working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many brothers and sisters are too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a saying that a foolish man will dare to go where angels fear to tread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a man places himself under God's mighty hand and remains in submission, not speaking or acting rashly, and not trying to be a teacher to many, he will carry out God's will and be qualified to make judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Subjectivity should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All divisions arise out of human subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A subjective person cannot obey others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before the Lord, it is not easy to make judgments concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet many young brothers come to some kind of judgment within five minutes without having prayed about it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Or perhaps they do not know how to pray in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are bold because they are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is impossible to tell such a person to fear God or to submit to others.</S>
