   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V."And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters" Gen 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the firmament we know.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The firmament divides the waters above from the water beneath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What had previously been deep in the brackish, dark, and dismal waters was divided and became a vapor ascending into the firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What a division!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through "the firmament," God has divided that which is pure from that which is evil and filthy, so that each may have its own place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The work of the cross is to divide.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's light shined upon the dark face of the deep and exposed its real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These enormous, boundless, and dismal waters were hidden deep under the covering of the darkness; it was not easy to recognize their real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the light came.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They could no longer hide.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more the light of God shines, the more it exposes vast and great filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Light does not cleanse; rather, it exposes the unseemly shame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Under the shining of God's light, men become contrite and penitent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The things in which they formerly took consolation, upon investigation, are found to be worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wickedness of the sinful life and nature receives its true evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is in the midst of our disappointments and repentance that we know the dividing power of God's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross has crucified our sin Rom 6:6, 11 , self Gal 2:20 , flesh Gal 5:24 , the world Gal 6:14 , and the elements of the world Col 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death divides.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Death is a great dividing, dissolution, and detaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death cuts off all relationships and terminates all entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the cross, nothing can divide us from things which are beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our union with Christ's death detaches us from the things which are "beneath."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we have been regenerated, sin, the self, the flesh, the world, and worldly elements can still tightly hold and drag us down.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After regeneration, if we die with Christ experientially, we will become a "divided" person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mark of the cross is the proof that we are heavenly people and that we are divided from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's light leads us into self-judgment, and after self-judgment to the cross, through which we receive deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not confuse our position and our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we believe in the Lord as our Savior, we have the highest position in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What He has accomplished for us is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we receive Him as our personal Savior, He divides that which is above from that which is beneath through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But at this time, we still may not have the experience of this division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we exercise our faith to receive what has been accomplished on the cross and are in union with His death, we have the real experience of being detached from the things beneath and setting our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we were born from above, the meaning of regeneration, we do not all have the experience of being "not of this world" John 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we have to enter into the Lord's death, to prove His death, so that we can have the real experience of dividing the spirit and soul Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the knife of the high priest pierces and divides the joints and marrow of the sacrifices, the cross, revealed through the Word of God, also divides our spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The moment we were born again, God reckoned us as being crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have believed that His death is a death on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since He has died for us, His death is our death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a co-death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A substitutionary death will naturally produce a co-death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For Him to die for us means we died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God accepted the Lord Jesus' death on our behalf, He reckoned us dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the view of our personal experience it is a substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the view of the judgment of the law it is a co-death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we died with Him in fact; but we still may not have the experience of this death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The experience of this co-death comes after we have been regenerated, in the struggle between the two lives and natures of light and darkness, as we seek deliverance at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Believers have this division not only in outward matters, but also in their inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is working in the heart of man in a hidden way, causing his love and desire to turn upward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The believers have been regenerated and have received God's divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The working of the Lord's cross causes this nature to divide the things which are above from the things which are beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The differences between earthly things and heavenly things are made manifest through God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now a believer's heart can turn toward the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The old, brackish, and dark heart, filled with wickedness and lusts, can be purged; it can now be set on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever there is life, there must be air for this life to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since the heavenly light has shined into our spirit, this spirit must breathe heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God not only is dividing the waters which are above from those which are beneath within us, He is also dividing things which are above and things which are beneath outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has put "the heavens" in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He also has put us in "the heavens," so that our faith can have a suitable environment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first mark of the saints is their being of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have received a heavenly calling and are looking unto the heavenly kingdom, desiring a heavenly city.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their hope is in the heavens, and they look forward to a heavenly country, counting themselves as pilgrims sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once we have the heavens inwardly and outwardly, we will know the things above from the things beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The inward heaven requires an outward heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One who has a heavenly life, will surely have a heavenly walk.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The nature of a regenerated person will lead him not to "walk in the counsel of the wicked," and not to "stand on the path of sinners, nor sit in the company of mockers" Psa 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Worldly pleasure, love, and fashion will have difficulty drawing him along.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a physically strong and healthy person cannot breathe dirty air, how can saints breathe in the midst of hatred, wickedness, frivolity, and confusion?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They will love the company of their brothers and companions in their heaven-bound pilgrimage.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers" 1 John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By this time, the heart of a believer has come under God's regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet he may not be much different from his former condition if the dry land has not appeared and fruit has not been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even though his heart is heaven-bound, and traffic between him and the heavens has begun, he needs to go further and bear fruit to glorify God.</S>
