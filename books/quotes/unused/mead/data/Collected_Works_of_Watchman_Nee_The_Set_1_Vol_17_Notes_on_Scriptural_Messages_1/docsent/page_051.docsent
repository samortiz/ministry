   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is most amazing in the way it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have said this before and I will say it again that there are two aspects to sin, and there are two aspects to the way God deals with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible tells us that there is a difference between sins and sin; one is before God, and the other is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our sins before God have to be forgiven and washed away, while sin within us must be overcome, and we must be delivered from it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our sins before God have been borne by the Lord Jesus, but the sin within us can only be removed through reckoning ourselves as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the sins before God, we have the washing of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the sin within us, there is the need for the deliverance of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need God's forbearance and forgiveness for our sins before Him, and we need freedom and deliverance from the sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two aspects of sin are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, we can only briefly consider the difference between these two aspects of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord willing, we will discuss them in detail later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For now, I will not mention the difference in the nature of sin and sins; we will only consider the difference in the effect of these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, let us consider our sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our sins before God give us no peace in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we think of judgment, hell, death, and questions related to man's end, we feel that we have sinned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we think of God's holiness, righteousness, and His ordination, we become fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, those who are sitting here who have not received Jesus as their Savior surely have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they do not have this experience, I feel sorry for them because this means that they are ignorant, insensitive, and unaware of their own danger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anyone with a little thoughtfulness will feel at a loss and not have peace when they consider Hades, death, hell, eternity, God's judgment, or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this is that they are sinners before God, and as long as their sin is not removed, they will not dare to think about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once they consider these things, they realize that they will go into the lake of fire and suffer eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They fear and have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This tells us that we are sinners before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our sins before God cause us to have no peace and to be afraid to think about such things as judgment, end times, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But man not only has sins before God, he also has sin in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A seminary student once said to his teacher, "I have found one new thing in the Bible today, which is the doctrine of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, the Bible mentions it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I did not see it until today."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teacher said, "Have you only discovered the doctrine of sin from the Bible today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I found that out from man's heart long ago."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need to go to the Bible to find the doctrine of sin; we can find it easily from man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone can testify that sin is not only before God but is also within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may lose our temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may think that outward things are causing us to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, all the outward things do not give us our temper, but a burning within causes our temper to burst out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may try to suppress it by force.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we cannot do it; as soon as there is an opportunity, the temper will burst out again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there is an explosion, we cannot blame it all on the sparks of fire; there must first be explosives.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sins issue from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people think that the reason their thoughts are unclean and filled with sins is that they have read unhealthy books which entice them to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But many times when the environment is clean and excellent, and there are no temptations anywhere, is our heart clean?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A young man said that he had read too many novels and that his mind was filled with evil and unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He asked if there was any way to cleanse his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Can we get rid of the unclean things within us just by shaking our heads?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can that be done?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can tell you that nothing will shake these things out from you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sin dwells within man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It has roots, and they cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many sinners like to gamble or smoke opium.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Certain outward factors are not seducing them into such acts, but an inward sin is pressing them to act this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sin has its punishment before God and its power within man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It causes us to do things we are not willing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if we try to suppress it with all our power and will to keep it from breaking out, when an opportunity is there, it breaks out just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the true condition of man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sin reigns within man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are its slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It has the power to snatch us away and cause us to do that which we are not willing to do.</S>
