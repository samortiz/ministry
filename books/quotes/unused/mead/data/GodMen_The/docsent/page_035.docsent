   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are the sheep, the righteous of the nations, justified by Christ at His throne of glory in His coming back according to the eternal gospel, not the gospel of grace, preached by an angel during the great tribulation Rev 14:6-7 that they may inherit the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world , that is, enter into eternal life to participate in the eternal blessing of the eternal life Matt 25:31-40, 46.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The earthly kings of the subjects will bring their splendor to God 21:24b , as the twenty-four elders cast their crowns before the throne of God 4:10 , and the nations will bring their splendor and their honor, that is, their preciousness in status and dignity in position, to God 21:26 , as the four living creatures do to God, who sits upon the throne 4:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This excellent and lovely New Jerusalem, not the "heavenly mansion" as the superstition of millions of Christians, is the dear expectation of God's elect Heb 11:10 and the destination, the goal, of the heavenly pilgrims.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the new heaven and new earth the eternal kingdom of God , in which is the New Jerusalem, righteousness will dwell for eternity 2 Pet 3:13: God's divine work throughout the four ages of man, the age of the forefathers, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom, on the one hand, consummates His new creation, and on the other hand, does away with Satan, sin, the old creation, and the old man to clear up all the unrighteousness from the universe.</S>
