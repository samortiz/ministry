   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers" Jer 11:10c .</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such conduct was against the last five of the commandments of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By their conduct and behavior in their daily living, Israel absolutely broke the commandments concerning murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, by their idolatrous worship and by their evil conduct, they completely annulled the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As far as they were concerned, the law was of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. God's Punishment over Israel 1.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of His Righteousness and Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although God's intention in giving Israel His law was to test and expose them, He still needed to punish them for the sake of His righteousness and holiness.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of their idolatry 11:8, 10b-11, 13-14, 17; 13:10b, 27 and their evil conduct 11:10a, 11, 15b-16, 19-23; 13:9 , God had to punish Israel.</S>
