However, I would first like to review the crucial matters, the intrinsic elements, in chapters twenty through twenty-four of Numbers.</P><P>In typology, these five chapters present us a picture of Christ and the church. Chapter twenty shows us Christ as the smitten rock who, in resurrection, is flowing out living water to meet our need (v. 8). Christ has been smitten, crucified, and there is no need for Him to be smitten again. Now He is in resurrection flowing with living water to quench people's thirst. The crucified and resurrected Christ is here to meet us in our need. As long as we have Him, God has no problem with us and we have no problem with God.</P><P>In chapter twenty-one we have further aspects of Christ. First, as the bronze serpent, Christ is our replacement (vv. 8-9). He became the same as we in nature with the exception that in Him there was no sin. He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), but He did not have the sinful nature, just as the bronze serpent had the form of a serpent without having the poisonous nature of a serpent. Because Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He could be our replacement, bearing God's judgment and accomplishing redemption. As our replacement, Christ has solved not only the outward problem of sins but also the inward problem of our sinful nature. Having solved these problems through His crucifixion, in resurrection this One has become a fountain, a well (Num. 21:17), springing up with living water, which is the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God. In our experience we need to dig this well (v. 18). If we dig the well, we will become nobles and leaders. Furthermore, as Numbers 33 indicates, Christ is our destination, our land of rest. Therefore, Christ is our replacement, our well, and our land of rest. When we enjoy Him as our land of rest, we do not have any lack or shortage.</P><P>In Numbers 23 and 24 we have four parables spoken by Balaam, a Gentile prophet. These parables reveal much concerning the church, with the fourth parable revealing something concerning Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_136.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_138.html">Next</a> </body></html>
