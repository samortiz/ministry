   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Asking Him Whether One Who Finds Fault</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Shall Contend with the Almighty</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 40:2 Jehovah said to Job, "Shall one who finds fault contend with the Almighty?/Let him who argues with God answer it."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah's question here indicates that He regarded Job as a fault finder, as one who was contending with the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Job had been arguing with God and even condemning him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Job could not deny that this was the very thing that he had been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would you like God to appear to you as the Almighty?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would prefer that He would come to me not as the Almighty but as the One who is full of mercy and lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Asking Him if He</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Will Annul God's Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 40:8 Jehovah asked Job further questions: "Will you indeed annul My judgment?/Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Job had condemned his friends for talking so much about God's judgment, but here God vindicates His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there were no divine judgment, the world would be in a state of anarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In previous messages we have emphasized the fact that God's dealing with His people is not for judgment or for punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this does not mean that God is not for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning this matter of judgment, we should not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we need to differentiate between God's government with His judgment and God's dealing with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Often the dealings of God are related to the governmental judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God does not allow anyone to annul His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Asking Him if He Had an Arm like God's</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, Jehovah asked Job if he had an arm like God's and if he could thunder with a voice like His v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book of Job is a book of argument.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In reading this book, we need to learn of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu to be silent and let God be the only one to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Job Answering Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Job answered Jehovah, saying, "Behold, I am worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What shall I reply to You?/I lay my hand over my mouth./I have spoken once, and I will not answer;/And twice, and I will proceed no further" 40:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word indicates that Job had been trained, disciplined, by God to be restricted in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many of the problems in married life are the result of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If husbands and wives did not argue or exchange words, there would be no divorce or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Much of our speaking is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we apply the cross to our flesh, this kind of speaking will be terminated.</S>
