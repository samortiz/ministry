   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this lesson we will continue to look at Jacob s prophecies with blessing for his twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CONCERNING DAN A. Judging His People as</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of the Tribes Scepters of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis 49:16 Jacob prophesied, Dan will judge his people, / As one of the tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that Jacob was concerned that Dan would be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Mosaic law, anyone who set up or worshipped an idol had to be cut off from the people Deut 13:5-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the Israelites entered the good land, the tribe of Dan brought in an idol among the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Dan should have been terminated as a tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Jacob, not wanting to see one of his sons cut off, blessed him prophetically out of a loving heart, saying that Dan would still be a tribe judging his people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This word was particularly fulfilled in Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>13:2, 24; 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jacob said that Dan would judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Hebrew word translated tribe first has the meaning of branch, then stick, staff, and scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A scepter signifies authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the word tribe actually means scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every tribe has a scepter, an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The twelve tribes were twelve scepters, twelve powers, twelve authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the time of Samson, the tribe of Dan certainly became a scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With Samson the tribe of Dan was a power, a real authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the fulfillment of Jacob s prophetic blessing concerning Dan in Genesis 49:16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jacob s word meant not only that Dan would remain as a tribe but also that Dan would be a scepter, an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This prophecy has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Being a Serpent in the Way,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>a Viper on the Path</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 17 Jacob continued, Dan will be a serpent in the way, / A viper on the path, / That bites the horse s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The serpent in this verse is worse than the serpent in Genesis 3, because it is a viper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dan eventually became a serpent, even a viper, because the tribe of Dan set up another center of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the tribe of Dan obtained the city of Dan in Judges 18, an idol made by Micah was set up in it 17:4-5; 18:17, 27, 30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time God s tabernacle was in Shiloh, but in the city of Dan there was an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The tribe of Dan not only set up a divisive center of worship in the good land but also appointed and hired their own priests v. 30; 1 Kings 12:29-31 . This made Dan one with Satan in bringing in stumbling blocks to frustrate God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Jacob prophesied that Dan bites the horse s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chapters 2 through 9 of 1 Chronicles the tribe of Dan was omitted in the record of the holy people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Dan s name is mentioned in 2:2 but in the following record his tribe was omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, the tribe of Dan is also not mentioned in the record in Revelation 7.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tribe of Dan did not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dan s name was omitted in the record in 1 Chronicles and Revelation because he fell and became one with God s enemy, becoming a viper and bringing in a stumbling block to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Notwithstanding, Dan will still be a tribe in the millennium because of his father s blessing Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>48:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This prophecy is certainly a picture of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>CONCERNING GAD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of the failure of Dan, Jacob prophesied in Genesis 49:19, saying, Gad, raiders will raid him, / But he will raid at their heel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With Dan there is defeat, but with Gad victory is brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Dan ends with failure, but Gad, who will raid at the heel of the raiders, comes in with the recovered victory.</S>
