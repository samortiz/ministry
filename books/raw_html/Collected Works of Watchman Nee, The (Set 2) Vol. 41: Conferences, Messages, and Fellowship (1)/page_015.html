<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class="title">PRIVATE TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1934<br />Place: Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">ON THE ASSEMBLY IN FOOCHOW AND ON DIVISION</h2><p class="indent1">(Editor's Note: In 1934 there was a meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai, a district in the city of Foochow. The meeting was not a part of any denomination, and it had knowledge of the church in Shanghai. The leaders of that meeting were a Miss Ding Shu-shin and John Wang. Brother K. H. Weigh as well as Watchman Nee's mother met with this assembly at one time. Miss Ding was opposed to the practice of head covering and later also sought for the experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Brother Weigh did not agree with her stand of opposing the head covering. The following are records of Brother Nee's talk with Brother Weigh concerning the subject and Brother Nee's advice.)</p><p>Since its severance from the denominations, the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai has never stood clearly on the proper ground of the church. This is a historical fact. This puts it at a distance from the other assemblies. Its initial testimony was merely a testimony for the truth of salvation. Later, it advanced to stand for the truth of baptism and then for the truth of the Lord's table. But it was never clear about the church ministry. As far as church ministry is concerned, it should submit itself to the assemblies which have advanced further in this aspect of the truth. The late-comers should submit to the early-comers. For example, it is only proper for the newly raised assembly in Swatow to follow the practice of the church in Shanghai. (July 31)</p><p>This time my coming to Foochow is only for settling general questions. The local problems in Foochow should be settled by the local brothers themselves.</p><p>Our problem with the meeting in Tsing-Tao-Kuan is a moral issue. It is related to the setting up of the Lord's table meeting there. We cannot participate in the breaking of bread in that meeting. However, our problem with She-Er-Jen-Pai has to do with the truth, such as the truth concerning head covering.</p><p>We can only take one of two stands concerning the head covering (with respect to the forbidding of the head covering in She-Er-Jen-Pai). Either we go to the meeting and cover our head, or we do not go to the meeting at all. Both stands are correct (see 1 Cor. 11:3-15).</p><p>It is unreasonable for She-Er-Jen-Pai to demand that others take off their head covering. Miss Ding demanded that everyone take off their head covering while waiting to be clear about the Lord's will. She also said that since most people did not cover their head, the minority should go along with the majority and wait on the Lord's leading in this way. But why would she not ask those who have not covered their head to cover their head while waiting on the Lord? Suppose the majority of them covered their head. Would Miss Ding also cover her head to wait on the Lord?</p><p>Miss Ding said that humanity as a whole already has its head covered in the order of God's creation and that there is no need to have a physical sign. I would ask, "If we are dead in Christ already, why do we have to be baptized?"</p><p>Miss Ding left the denominations through the help of Hwa Wei-cheng's Bible teachings at Tien-An Chapel. You do not have to argue with her about her isolated issues one by one. [This probably refers to such issues as head covering.] All you have to do is to ask, "What right does a man have to express his opinion before God or to question God? (Rom. 9:19-21). Toward God's Word there is no need for us to ask why. As long as we know that it is God's Word, that is enough."</p><p>Those whose flesh is not thoroughly crucified often ask why. Even many preachers often try to study the "whys." But a spiritual man does not ask why; he only asks what.</p><p>Moreover, according to the teaching of the Bible, a woman does not have any place in teaching the truths (1 Cor. 14:34; 1 Tim. 2:12). We see no such thing in the Bible. Even if Miss Ding is opposed to the matter of head covering, she should not be teaching this as a teaching.</p><p>In the event that there is a division in She-Er-Jen-Pai, it will not be the result of a dispute concerning head covering. There have been a series of factors accumulating throughout the years, leading to the present outbreak. (July 25)</p><p>Of course, I have to say a word to you as well. You were wrong as well. If you were unhappy with the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai in any way, you should have discussed it with the responsible ones there and not have criticized them behind their backs. (August 2)</p>
