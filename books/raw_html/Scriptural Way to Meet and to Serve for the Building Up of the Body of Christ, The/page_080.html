 <h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:12-16 speaks of the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. We grow in life by fully knowing the Son of God (v. 13a). The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. We should endeavor to know Christ as the Son of God by studying the New Testament.</p>
<p>Our growth in life is for arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (v. 13b). We need to understand the relationship of these four nouns in 4:13&mdash;the measure, the stature, the fullness, and Christ. The measure is of the stature, the stature is of the fullness, and the fullness is of Christ. A man&rsquo;s body is his fullness, his expression. Because we have a body, we all have a stature, and our stature has a measure. A man&rsquo;s body grows by his eating. It is through eating that the fullness of a man is enlarged. When the fullness, the body of a man, is enlarged, the stature of that fullness is also enlarged; furthermore, the measurement of the stature is increased. A man has a fullness, the fullness has a stature, and the stature has a measure. The fullness of Christ is simply the expression of Christ, and this expression is the very church, which is His Body. The church as the fullness, the expression, of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a measure. We have not arrived at this yet. We must endeavor to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by growing in the divine life, by having God added into our being all day long.</p>
<p>By holding to truth in love, we grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15). Truth means reality. According to the context of Ephesians 4:15, &ldquo;truth&rdquo; refers to Christ and His Body, the church. In God&rsquo;s eyes, besides God Himself, only two things are realities: Christ and the church. We have to learn how to hold to Christ and the church in love. We love Christ, so we hold to Him. We love the church, so we hold to the church. By holding to Christ and the church in love, we grow up into Christ in all things.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:16, the growth in life is for the building up of the Body of Christ. In the building up of the Body of Christ, all the Body is fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply according to the operation in measure of each one part. Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE ITEMS CONCERNING<br />
BOTH THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING CARRIED OUT<br />
MAINLY THROUGH THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is mainly carried out in the meetings, through the meetings, and with the meetings. If we do not have the proper meetings, there is no possibility for the building up of the Body of Christ. Our meetings must be proper and up-to-date. Any meeting that is still according to the old way is below the level for the building up of the Body of Christ. I do not mean, however, that the old way of meeting did not accomplish anything. These meetings according to the old way did save and edify many people, but going along with this help, there was the annulling, the killing, and the binding of the members of Christ.</p>
<p>Christianity has brought in millions of believers, but most of them have been annulled in their function and made of no effect. Some in Christianity have even claimed that they are short of manpower to evangelize the world, but where are all the millions of believers that have been saved there? Their organic function was confiscated due to the wrong way of meeting. On the one hand, this wrong type of meeting accomplishes something, but on the other hand, it tears down what it builds up.</p>
<p>To some extent we have been doing the same thing. We have not had much increase, and today among the dear saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery not many are organically useful. Therefore, there is the need of some labor to have a transition. As today&rsquo;s church people, we are transit passengers. We are in transit from an old way of meeting and serving to a new, scriptural way. We have been Christians for years under the annulling of the old way of meeting. Many of us are so quiet and calm in the meetings. We have become dumb and disabled.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been helped to sing the hymns, pray, and stand up to read Bible verses freely. These practices have kept us alive. When I first came to minister the Word in the United States, I still remember how quiet the attendants were when I walked into the meeting. Even though there were verses on the board, no one would read them. Everyone sat there, waiting for someone else to do everything for them. We were never enabled, taught, developed, or promoted to function in this way. I told the saints that they did not need to wait to read the verses but that they had the privilege, freedom, and ability to stand up and read them in a living way by ones, by twos, by rows, by groups, or by everyone at one time. Gradually we have learned not only to sing and to pray but also to read the verses in this way. But even today the reading of the Scriptures in the meetings is still not up to the standard. We should not read in such an orderly, formal, regulated, and mechanical way. We need to read livingly, not like robots.</p>
<p>Eventually, we began to have a time for the saints to share after each message. Through this many have learned how to speak a brief word, but not many can speak a word for the Lord full of spiritual significance for three to ten minutes. We may be able to shout &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; for a few seconds, but what about speaking a word full of spiritual significance? Many of us have never been perfected or helped to speak something for the Lord in this way. Why are we not able to speak a word for the Lord for one minute, although we have been Christians for years? This shows that our organic ability to speak for the Lord has been annulled in our being. It seems that many of us do not have a speaking organ. I do believe, however, that in two or three years, there will be a great improvement in the meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because the saints will be enabled to speak a word for the Lord. All the items concerning both the growth in life and the building up of the Body of Christ are carried out mainly through the church meetings.</p>
