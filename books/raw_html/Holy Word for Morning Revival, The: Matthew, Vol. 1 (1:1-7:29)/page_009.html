<p class="bold">WEEK 2 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 1:18, 20-21</h2><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child <sup>1</sup>of the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been <sup>1</sup>begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>21 &nbsp;And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name <sup>1</sup>Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>18<sup>1</sup> Lit., out of. Although Christ was born of Mary (v. 16), He was a child of the Holy Spirit. The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit (v. 20). His source was the Holy Spirit and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking the likeness of the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7).</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> God was first born into Mary through His Spirit; after the conception was completed, He, with the human nature, was born to be a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity. This is the origin of Christ.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (Heb. 4:8; Matt. 11:28-29), which is Himself as the good land to us.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God’s sovereignty (1:8; Luke 1:26-27).…If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon…how could Jesus have been born…in Bethlehem? Now we can see God’s sovereignty in bringing back the [ancestors]…of both Joseph and Mary [Matt. 1:12; Ezra 5:1-2.] By His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). [Even more,] by His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David.</p><p>According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary’s surrender.…It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child.…Mary might have said, “Gabriel, don’t you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?” After listening to the angel, Mary said, “Behold the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38).…To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price—the cost of her whole being.</p><p>However, Mary’s surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35).…Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit’s power to come into us and accomplish something.</p><p>Although there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph’s obedience and coordination (Matt. 1:19-21, 24-25). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce?…Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore,…Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.
