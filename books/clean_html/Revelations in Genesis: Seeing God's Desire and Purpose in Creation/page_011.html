<h2 class="head3">Ruling for God to Deal with His Enemy</h2>
<p>God desires that man would rule for Him and exercise dominion for Him. According to Genesis 1:26, God wants man to &ldquo;have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; To have dominion over the fish of the sea is to have dominion over the sea, to have dominion over the birds of the air is to have dominion over the air, and to have dominion over the cattle and every creeping thing is to have dominion over the earth. Therefore, God wants man to have dominion over everything in the sea, in the air, and on the earth. God has given dominion to man in these three realms.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are four key places in the universe: the heavens, the sea, the air, and the earth. God has committed the sea, the air, and the earth to man for his dominion. Why did God do this? What was His intention? The Bible reveals that in the universe today only the heavens are still God&rsquo;s dwelling place, where He rules. The enemy, Satan, has usurped the sea, the air, and the earth. Hence, God wants man to have dominion over these three places so that man would rule over these three places for God in order to deal with His enemy.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the sea is the dwelling place of the demons. In Matthew 8:28-32 the demons who were cast out of two people went into a herd of hogs. The whole herd rushed down a steep slope into the sea and died in the waters. Demons are different from the evil spirits in the air. The evil spirits take the air as their dwelling place, but the demons take the sea as their dwelling place.</p>
<p>Today people are still possessed by demons. It is not uncommon to hear stories of people possessed by demons. No matter how much science advances or how much people promote the putting aside of superstitions, we must solemnly acknowledge that there is not only God but also demons in this universe. The progress of science cannot overthrow this fact, and putting aside superstitions cannot annul the existence of demons. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He often encountered demon-possessed people and had to cast out the demons (4:24; 8:16; Mark 1:34). Many of us who work for the Lord have also encountered incidents of demon possession. Around one hundred years ago the Lord sent Dr. John L. Nevius of the Presbyterian Church in America to Shantung for the gospel. His book, entitled <em>Demon Possession and Allied Themes,</em> is an authoritative writing on demon possession. The stories of demon possession in this book are not hypothetical; they are a record of the author&rsquo;s casting out demons in village after village when he was preaching the gospel in Shantung. Demons exist, and their dwelling place is the sea.</p>
<p>In the Bible the sea is not a positive place, because it is the dwelling place of demons. During the six days of God&rsquo;s restoration work, He saw that it was &ldquo;good&rdquo; every day except for the second day (Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25), because on the second day God separated the waters from the waters, producing the air and the sea (vv. 6-8). Satan and his fallen angels are in the air, and the demons are in the sea. Hence, on the second day God did not see that it was good.</p>
<p>Many other portions in the Bible reveal that the sea is not a good place. For example, when God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, the first problem that they encountered was the sea (Exo. 14). Furthermore, in the Gospels the Lord Jesus was crossing the sea to cast out demons when He encountered the hindering of the winds and the sea. It was not the winds or the sea that were hindering the Lord; it was the fallen angels and demons behind the winds and the sea. Hence, the Lord Jesus rebuked the winds and the sea. If the winds and the sea were merely in the physical realm, there would have been no need to rebuke them. The Lord was rebuking the fallen angels and demons behind the scene (Matt. 8:23-27). Revelation also reveals that the forces opposing God come out of the sea (13:1-10). The purpose of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is to clear up the sea. This work will not be completed until the coming of the new heaven and the new earth. Then the sea will cease to exist because it will have been eliminated by God (21:1).</p>
<p>Ephesians speaks of the authority of the air and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies (2:2; 6:12), both of which refer to the angels who followed Satan in his rebellion. These rebelling angels dwell in the air and are the authority of the air, and Satan is the ruler of the authority of the air. Thus, Satan occupies the air.</p>
<p>The air is the dwelling place of Satan and his evil spirits, and the sea is the dwelling place of the demons, but the earth is the place where they operate. The earth is the center of their activities. Satan, the evil spirits, and the demons work to usurp the earth, because their goal is to occupy the earth. For this reason, God wants man not only to rule over the air and the sea but also to have dominion over the earth. The earth is the center of these three realms.</p>
<p>God committed the sea, the air, and the earth to man&rsquo;s dominion so that man would rule for Him in these three realms and deal with His enemy. This is revealed in the particular utterance in Genesis 1:26: &ldquo;Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; Logically, it would be sufficient to say &ldquo;Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle of the earth,&rdquo; but God added another phrase: <em>and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.</em> The earth and the creeping things are emphatically pointed out. God gave man dominion over three realms, but He particularly pointed out the earth. Moreover, there are numerous kinds of animals on the earth, but God emphatically mentioned the creeping things. This indicates that of the three places over which God gave man dominion, God focused on the earth, and among the animals on the earth God focused on the creeping things. In Luke 10:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions.&rdquo; Serpents and scorpions are creeping things on the earth. God is concerned about the earth and the creeping things on the earth because Satan and his messengers are hidden in the creeping things on the earth.</p>
<p>From the above verses we can understand that God&rsquo;s curse on the serpent, &ldquo;Upon your stomach you will go&rdquo; (Gen. 3:14), was to limit the serpent&rsquo;s activities to the earth. The activities of God&rsquo;s enemy and his fallen messengers take place on the earth. They are creeping things; they cannot operate outside of the earth. Hence, when God commissioned man to rule for Him, He focused on the earth and the creeping things so that man would deal with His enemies on the earth.</p>
<p>God charged man to deal with His enemies so that man would rule for Him. When God created man, His desire was not only that man would express His image but also that man would rule for Him in order to deal with His enemy. In this twofold purpose, the aspect of expressing God&rsquo;s image is positive and primary, but the aspect of dealing with the enemy is negative and supplementary. Expressing God is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, but dealing with His enemy is a supplementary purpose that was added because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s unique eternal desire is for the universe to be a realm with all things as the content and a group of people as the center. God created man in a particular way so that man would ultimately be the same as He is in image, life, and nature in order to become God&rsquo;s expression. In this desire God did not have the thought of dealing with an enemy.</p>
<p>According to His desire, God made an eternal plan, based upon which He created the universe. This is the original creation recorded in Genesis 1:1. The main creatures in this creation were angels. The highest angel was the archangel Lucifer, who was anointed to cover the Ark (Ezek. 28:13-14). However, this archangel exalted himself and rebelled against God. Furthermore, some of the angels under him joined in his rebellion. Even some living creatures on the earth, over which he was given dominion, also joined in his rebellion.</p>
<p>After this archangel rebelled against God, he became God&rsquo;s adversary in the universe. In Hebrew <em>Satan</em> means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo; Everything that Satan does is against God in order to offend God, frustrate God&rsquo;s will, and even violate God&rsquo;s authority and overthrow God&rsquo;s lordship (Isa. 14:12-14). He does nothing else. Because of this rebellion, he became Satan, the angels who followed him became the evil spirits, and the living creatures on the earth under his dominion became the demons.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s rebellion resulted in two systems of lordship in the universe: God&rsquo;s lordship and Satan&rsquo;s lordship of rebellion. After Satan rebelled against God, the heavens remained the place where God dwells and rules, but the air became the dwelling place of Satan and the evil spirits, the sea became the dwelling place of the demons, and the earth became the realm of their activities. Hence, God&rsquo;s authority in the air, in the sea, and on the earth is undermined, and His will cannot be carried out freely.</p>
<p>Because God&rsquo;s lordship was violated, dealing with His enemy was added to God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s desire to be expressed was from eternity, but the desire to deal with His enemy was added.</p>
<p>When Satan and his messengers rebelled against God, they corrupted the entire original creation. As a result, the earth became waste and emptiness, darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the earth was full of desolation and death (Gen. 1:2). This desolate situation lasted for an unknown period of time before God carried out His restoration and further creation in six days. During this time God created man. The center of His work is the creation of man. God has a twofold purpose in creating man. On the positive side, He wants to be expressed; on the negative side, He wants to deal with His enemy. The positive aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is eternal, but the negative aspect did not come until Satan rebelled. The positive aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is a matter of image, but the negative aspect is a matter of lordship, dominion. Therefore, Genesis 1:26-27 speaks of image first, saying that God created man in His image and then speaks of man having dominion over everything in the sea, in the air, and upon the earth. The main purpose of man&rsquo;s having dominion is to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
