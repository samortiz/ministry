Today is our happiest day because the days of trials, of "tending sheep in the land of the Midians" have been completed. Many difficulties are behind us. Thank the Lord who loves us, who has given us the same mind, the same hope, and the same footsteps. Tomorrow we will go upstream along the Nu River and enter Tibet. May the Father bless His testimony, and may glory be to His holy name. We wish that the dear brothers and sisters would offer up a special prayer for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min, the night before departure</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>Brother Hu and I have decided to set out on August 22 to cross the Lan-Chang River, climb Nu Mountain, and go up Nu River into Sikang, preaching the gospel along the way. May the Lord bless our work this time, and may He glorify His own name. We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us! This trip will take us two months. The Lord willing, I will send my wife to live in K'un-ming when I return. I heard that Ah-Dun-Tze was attacked by robbers on August 12 and that everything was ransacked. This has closed that way into Sikang; therefore, we can only go up the Nu River.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, August 19</p><h2 class="head3">Temporarily Stopping at Nu River</h2><h2 class="head4">One</h2><p>We cannot thank the Lord enough for bringing us safely to Nu River. We stayed here for more than twenty days, working in the areas where Brother Hu used to work. I heard that there are over a thousand Li-Suh believers in this part of Nu River, meeting in over ten places. These Li-Suh natives have asked us to preach to them. Thank the Lord that we have found ready ears when we preach. Perhaps some will receive God's salvation. Brother Hu and I had intended to enter Tibet and then Sikang, but the way to Tibet is closed. No one is allowed to go through it. We have been stopped from advancing any further. The situation in Ah-Dun-Tze is very unstable, and it was impossible to take that way either. We can only preach in Nu River. We will come down from Hwang-Shan to the Shang-Po region, having heard that many areas around there have never heard the gospel. We will work there. In two weeks I will have to return to Yeh-Ji. After my return I will send my wife to K'un-ming. The Lord has opened the door at Nu River, and we intend to look for a place to do some serious work. May the Lord's will be accomplished, amen.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, on Na-Ou Mountain at Nu River<br />September 15</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>We have been at Nu River for about a month already. The Nu tribes and the Li-Suh natives desire the Lord's truth very much. Unfortunately, there is no one to preach the real gospel to them. But now the Lord has opened their eyes a little. Thank the Lord that some have understood the truth of eternal life and of the forgiveness of sins. There are many places in this area that have never heard the gospel before. We intend to work in these places. Brother Hu is still at Nu River and will return in approximately three weeks. Presently, I am getting the luggage ready and preparing to send my wife and children to K'un-ming. The Lord willing, after I settle them in K'un-ming, I will return and enter the Nu River or the Chu-Tze River before the snow blocks the mountain way. I heard that many Chu-Tze natives have believed in the Lord, and the preachers are Li-Suh natives and Nu natives. The only ones who have been to these places were some Westerners from the Assembly of God Church. There are still many places that have never heard the gospel before. The Lord has prepared one or two people who know the Li-Suh language well. One is a Han Chinese, and the other is a Li-Suh native. Both of them have implored me to stay at Nu River and Chu-Tze River to preach the gospel there. It seems that we cannot go into Sikang for now. Perhaps the door of the work has not opened yet. The disturbance in Ah-Dun-Tze is still going on. We can only commit our future to the Lord. If we can set out on the third of October, we can arrive in K'un-ming on October 21 or 22.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, September 30</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
