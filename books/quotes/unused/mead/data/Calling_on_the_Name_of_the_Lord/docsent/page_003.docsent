   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO CALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How should we call on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must call on Him out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our heart, which is the source of our calling, must be pure, seeking nothing except the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, we must call with a pure lip Zeph 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to watch our speech, for nothing contaminates our lips more than loose talk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our lips are impure due to loose talk, it will be difficult for us to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Along with a pure heart and pure lips, we need to have an open mouth Psa 81:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to open our mouth wide to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, we need to call on the Lord corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Timothy 2:22 says, "But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to come together for the purpose of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Psalm 88:9 says, "Lord, I have called daily upon thee."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we should call daily upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, Psalm 116:2 says, "Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we live, we should call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE NEED OF PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Calling on the name of the Lord is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to practice it daily and hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should never stop our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We hope that many more of the Lord's people, especially new believers, will begin the practice of calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, many Christians have found that they can know Him, that they can be brought into the power of His resurrection, that they can experience His spontaneous salvation, and that they can walk in oneness with Him by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In any situation, at any time, call: "Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you practice calling on His name, you will see that it is a wonderful way to enjoy the Lord's riches.</S>
