   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spiritual Rock</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul goes on to say, All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the spiritual rock, Christ follows the believers to give them the spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spiritual drink in verse 4 refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 , typifying the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ, as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His crucifixion Christ, as the living, spiritual rock, was smitten by the authority of God s law in order that the water of life in resurrection could flow out of Him into His redeemed people for them to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The water of life flowing out of the smitten rock signifies the Spirit John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should all drink the same spiritual drink and should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God s chosen people was a physical rock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the apostle called it a spiritual rock because it typified Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life John 19:34 to satisfy the thirst of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was bold to say that the physical rock of Exodus 17:6 was a spiritual rock and that this rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In actuality the rock in Exodus 17 was physical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we need to have a spiritual view of this physical rock and see through the physical into the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because Paul viewed this rock according to his spiritual sight, in his eyes it was a spiritual rock.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To him, that rock was Christ, and he boldly declared this in 1 Corinthians 10:4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the cross He was smitten by the authority of God s righteous law to accomplish God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God s people to drink John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This living water is the water of life in resurrection, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This water of life quenches our thirst and satisfies our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink 1 Cor 12:13 , and we also need to be thirsty John 7:37; Rev 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we need to come to the Lord John 7:37; Rev 22:17 , to ask of the Lord John 4:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Num 20:8 , and to call on the name of the Lord Isa 12:3-4; Acts 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the spiritual rock, Christ follows the believers to be the source of living water to them Exo 17:6; John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mainly, the Lord led the children of Israel through the wilderness into the good land in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night Exo 13:21 , but in regard to many details, the Lord followed them in their journey through the wilderness because they were disobedient to His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, mainly the Lord is leading us, the New Testament believers, into glory Heb 2:10 , but in regard to many details He is following us because of our disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, He does not want us to go to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet when we go to those places, He does not give up on us; rather, He still follows us with a purpose of bringing us back under His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the Lord was leading the children of Israel through the wilderness into the good land; as a result, they entered into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, the Lord was following these foolish people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we need to know that as the spiritual rock Christ is following us, who often foolishly wander in the wilderness of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ultimately, He will achieve His purpose to bring us into Himself as the reality of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will then tell the Lord, You are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were so foolish when we wandered in the wilderness of our soul for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet through these years of wandering, our real condition our sinfulness, our unfaithfulness, and our shortage of the living water was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the spiritual rock, You nevertheless followed us to give us the spiritual drink in order to quench our thirst and to bring us back under Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, You have brought us into Yourself as the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As our guide, Christ not only leads us but also follows us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Christ who follows us as the spiritual rock flows out the life-giving Spirit as the living water to satisfy our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that the spiritual rock followed the children of Israel indicates that they were not obedient to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although they were disobedient to Him, they had the rock following them, and the living water flowed out of the rock to quench the thirst of these sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the intrinsic significance of 1 Corinthians 10:4, the situation of the New Testament believers is exactly the same as that of the children of Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is leading us, yet we are not obedient to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, as the spiritual rock He follows us to flow out His eternal life in order to quench our thirst and, ultimately, to carry out God s purpose, that is, to bring us all into the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land.</S>
