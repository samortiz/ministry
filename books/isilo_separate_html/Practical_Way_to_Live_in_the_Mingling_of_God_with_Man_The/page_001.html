<h2 class="head2">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a conference in Reseda and Los Angeles, California, February 12-17, 1963. The conference consisted of six meetings; however, no record exists for Message Three. Consequently, this book contains only five chapters. These messages have not been reviewed by the speaker.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
