   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEETING OF THE OVERSEERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In every locality all the responsible brothers those who are elders and overseers should have an overseers meeting every week.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You can give this meeting any name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may call it the overseers meeting or a shepherding meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the time for the responsible brothers to pray together and to receive the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is something they must do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I know of a certain church not in China where the responsible brothers decided to meet for a whole day once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Starting in the morning, everyone brought his food and labored together to pray and consider every item of the things in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps we may not have that much time; then at least once a week the leading brothers should meet together for half a day or a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Considering Things before God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>during the First Half of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the first half of the meeting perhaps after lunch from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00, 3:00, or 4:00 p.m. , the elders should close their doors and not care for anything else but the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Seriously consider and arrange things before God and discuss them item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes you can also have discussions like those in 1 Corinthians 14 to fellowship the light that you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, do not make decisions based upon your discussions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible there are discussions in order to deal with things, but discussion is for seeking light and not for making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Discussion is to discover facts and lay them out but not for making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During that time the brothers should discuss, consider, and pray over all the things item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Receiving Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>during the Second Half of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the second half of the meeting, set aside a time to receive brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should wait there whether or not brothers come to see you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must by all means set aside time to receive the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will be helpful to the work and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Workers Meeting Together with the Overseers</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time you workers should stand beside the elders and be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that day or half day, you should be with them and watch them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are things you need to tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their light attitude should be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their attitude should be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Remind them that they are dealing with spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people come to ask questions, teach the elders how to answer and how to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the beginning you may answer when some brothers come to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After those brothers leave, tell the elders why you answered in that way, why you said it in those words, what scriptural basis you have, and what feeling you have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In some cases you may need to rebuke a brother who comes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When that brother leaves, you need to tell them why you rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a period of time, let them handle it and sit back and watch.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Producing a Few Reliable, Responsible Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We believe that when everyone serves, this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church service is the service of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a matter of two or three persons serving, but the whole church serving.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, when you go out to work, it would be a big mistake if you could not cause all the brothers to come forth to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you go out, you may lead many to be saved and bring them into service, yet if you cannot produce a few reliable brothers to bear the responsibility of the church, your going out will be a total failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that when you go out this time, you will be very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But do not be busy in an ordinary way, because there is much work you have to initiate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a great amount of work for you to do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is all before you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One item of this work is to produce a few responsible brothers in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By no means should you work in a way that only you yourself know how to bear responsibility, yet you are not able to help others do so.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The principle of the church is that the Lord Jesus put Himself in the twelve, the twelve in the three thousand, and the three thousand in tens of thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You put yourself in many responsible brothers, the responsible brothers in many brothers and sisters, and many brothers and sisters in many sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should continue to spread in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps when you come back to Kuling after many years, you will have grown spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you cannot reproduce your growth in three, five, eight, or ten brothers, I will recognize this as a grave failure in your service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, you should cause the elders of the local churches to be capable of bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul did not leave Titus in Crete and Timothy in Ephesus and tell them to return after they established elders.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, he told them to set up elders and to teach and train the elders how to be proper elders, helping them to an extent that they could bear responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the way was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, I hope that from now on you will be very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope that no one will be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A lazy person is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Always put yourself in the midst of the responsible brothers and help them to the extent that they can bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, your own spiritual condition must be more advanced than theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Otherwise, you will not be able to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that you brothers can properly deal with this matter of the responsible brothers and train them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Pay attention to the aspect of responsibility and oversight step by step.</S>
