<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Praying out of a Pure Heart</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; During the desolation of the church, only those with a pure heart can find the way. In the desolation of the church many people cannot find the way because their heart is impure, and they are unable to discern the nature of things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Pure Heart Being a Matter of Motive</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that in touching someone&rsquo;s work, we must discern its nature. In this chapter we will consider the matter of motive. Our nature must be gold and silver, and our motive must be pure. When the church is in desolation, and we want to determine whether we should participate in the work of a certain preacher, we need to discern the nature and motive of the work. One who works for the Lord must have a clear motive, not a cloudy one. A clear motive is pure; a cloudy motive is mixed and impure. Paul says that some preach Christ because of envy (Phil. 1:15). Such persons may be zealous and obtain good results, but when we examine their motive, we see that their hearts are not pure.</p>
<p>In the Bible to be pure means to be only for God. In serving the Lord, we should be purely for Him and not for anything else. We should not covet anything for ourselves or have our own enjoyment. Moreover, we should not ask anything for ourselves. We should be wholly for God. Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; A pure heart is a heart fixed on God. Whenever our heart pursues something other than God instead of being fixed on God, it is no longer pure.</p>
<p>Some local churches are right in the truth, in their standing, and in their practice, but their motive is not pure. They want something other than God or have some other pursuit. Although they may claim to be a local church and say that they are not a sect, and although their appearance appears to confirm this, there still is an inward problem with their motive because they are seeking something other than God. Thus, we cannot look only at standing, truth, doctrine, and so-called condition; we need to see the inward motive. We should not apply this word only to others; we should first examine ourselves. Our standing, truth, doctrine, and practice may be right, but we may not be pleasing to God, because He searches our heart to see our motive. God considers our heart an important matter.</p>
<p>First Samuel 13:14 says that David was a man according to God&rsquo;s heart. David was according to God&rsquo;s heart because his heart was right and pure toward God. David cared only for God and not for himself. In contrast, Saul cared only for himself and not for God. Although Saul was the anointed one with the proper position, his heart toward God was not right. In such a situation we must be like Jonathan and choose to follow David. We should not follow Saul simply because of his position. We need to see through his position to ascertain his motive. David&rsquo;s followers acknowledged Saul&rsquo;s position and standing as God&rsquo;s anointed, but they also recognized his motive before God. They saw that despite Saul&rsquo;s position, his heart toward God was not right. They also realized that although David did not have any position, his heart toward God was clean and pure. Saul had the proper position, but because his heart was improper, he lost the position; David did not have the position, but because he had a proper heart, he eventually obtained the position.</p>
<p>Just as a king cannot sit on the throne with a wrong motive, we cannot use our position in the church as a shield. We cannot say that our way is of the Lord because it is the position of the church. Everything hinges on our motive. Are the activities in our locality for God or for ourselves? Our answer will reveal whether we are a David or a Saul. Saul did not have a pure heart; those without a pure heart may have the right position, but in a short time they will lose that position.</p>
<p>To determine whether we can work with certain brothers or sisters, we need to discern their inward motive. We need to see whether they are for the Lord or for themselves and whether their heart is pure or mixed. This is not a high doctrine, but it is a crucial question regarding our inward condition. If we do not have a pure, single heart for God in our service, we should not expect to find co-workers like David. When our heart is even slightly impure, those who have a pure heart cannot work with us. We should not think that someone who does not work with us is sectarian. Putting a person who has a pure heart with a person who has an impure heart is a terrible mixture; it is Babylon the Great. We cannot condemn the sin of sectarianism while upholding the sin of mixture.</p>
<p>Those who are pure in heart will find others who live before God to be their co-workers. Since their heart has been dealt with, they are able to discern the condition of the heart of those they contact. The pure in heart stand together to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way, and do the Lord&rsquo;s work because inwardly their hearts are pure, not because they share the same doctrinal viewpoint. Differences in opinion related to doctrine lead to divisions. When one who is pure in heart meets another person who is pure in heart, he can willingly be martyred for that person and love him as if he were the Lord. We gain the best co-workers and companions when we are pure in heart.</p>
<p>We should not be foolish in choosing our co-workers. Just as a person cannot change his marriage, we cannot change our co-workers. If we are co-working with one person today and another person tomorrow, we have a problem. Our ability to work with someone depends on our heart. If I am accustomed to breathing fresh air, and I smell stale, dank air when I enter a room, I will not be able to take it. However, if I am accustomed to stale, dank air, then I will not even notice it. If someone has a problem in his heart, and we do not recognize it, there is a problem with our heart as well. A person whose heart has been dealt with before the Lord can discern the heart of others. If our heart is pure, we can tell whether or not the heart of others is pure.</p>
<p>The companions I chose when I first began to serve the Lord are still my companions today; I have not changed my companions. Please forgive me for saying this&mdash;this is because when I was called to serve the Lord, my heart was pure; I only knew that the Lord had touched me and wanted me to live for Him. The first person I encountered was Brother Watchman Nee. I knew that I must be his co-worker, and I put myself under him because I felt that his heart was purely for God.</p>
<p>I coordinated with another brother for about twenty years before he passed away. There were no problems between us because the Lord brought us together. I felt that his heart was for nothing but the Lord. I can testify that he paid a great price for the church and suffered much. However, he never had any feeling for himself, nor did he speak for himself. He had a pure heart; thus, we served the Lord together in one accord and walked in the Lord&rsquo;s way together. Only those who are pure in heart can walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
