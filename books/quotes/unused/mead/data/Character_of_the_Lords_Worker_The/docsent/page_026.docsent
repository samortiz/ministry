   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same principle applies to the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times our Lord went without food for the sake of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did not make His eating a priority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this does not mean that our Lord never ate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He could eat well at ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the need was before Him, He could forsake eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to put the body under subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not so dependent on food that our work has to stop if we have to go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unfortunately, in the Lord's work, many cannot function without food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We undoubtedly need food, and we have to take care of our physical body, but the body must be trained to go without food when special circumstances call for it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Remember the occasion when the Lord sat down at noon beside Jacob's well to rest while the disciples went to get some food in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and the Lord asked her for a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time He opened up the matter of the living water to her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end the woman did not give Him anything to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was high noon, the time for a meal and a drink, but the Lord patiently explained to this spiritually thirsty and suffering Samaritan woman the word of life and the meaning of the living water John 4:5-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us how one can carry on God's work without the interruption of food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we arrive at a certain place and cannot do anything until we have had a meal, our body is not serving us as it should.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be extremists, and we should not skip our meals all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when there are special demands, we should be able to forego our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Bread is not the most important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be the master of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we need to go without a meal, our body should obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not be overcome by our body's insistent cries for food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Mark 3 the Lord was surrounded by such a multitude that He had no time to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His relatives reacted by seeking to drag Him away from the crowd, for they said He was beside Himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet the Lord continued with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was not beside Himself, but the multitude had their pressing needs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was able to forego His food and drink for the sake of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we can never forego our own needs when the work demands our immediate attention, we will have little effective work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At critical times we have to push ourselves a little to the extreme; we have to be somewhat beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the need calls for it, we should be able to bridle our body and ignore the demands for food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not consider these demands to be mandatory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible plainly states that Christians should fast when occasion requires.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meaning of fasting is to temporarily put aside the legitimate demand of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes a special need calls for serious prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At these times we should fast before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not advocate fasting three or five times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if a man has been a Christian for eight or ten years and has never fasted once, something is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord spoke of fasting in His teaching on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have never fasted, we lack something in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose of fasting is to make our body our slave.</S>
