<h2 class="head2">An-Hwa, Hunan Province</h2><p>Brother Zhang Gun-jih's family and I arrived in Tung-Ping from Yi-Yang on November 13. The Lord guided us all the way. Brother Zhang has been sick for more than two months. Presently, he is not in critical condition, but he still needs the prayers of all the brothers and sisters. The fever has not left, and there is still much coughing.</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, November 26</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>After spending some time to recuperate, and through your prayer and concern, I can ask now that you turn your prayers into praise, because God has completely healed me, one who has so little faith in Him. I came out of the Yi-Yang hospital with God's promise. Although my fever was gone and the test on the sputum was negative, I still had many ailments&mdash;headaches, stuffed nose, bronchitis, etc.&mdash;when I was in the hospital. I weighed only ninety-seven pounds and figured that I would need over half a year for recovery. But God's thoughts and ways are higher than mine! In early September Brother Yang Dai came back to Yi-Yang from Ch'ang-sha. He had a letter from a brother in Tientsin, which spoke of a sudden tragedy in his life that caused him to become very sick. The Lord enlightened him, and he realized that he had not obeyed Him. In desperation he called on the Lord and confessed his sins, and God gave him a promise from Proverbs 4:22. His sickness then left without the assistance of any medicine. The letter did not affect me much at the time. But as I was praying one day, I felt that the Lutheran Hospital was not doing my health any good, and that I might have to pass through the suffering of surgery if I went to the Shing-Ya Hospital. It seemed that the best thing was to ask for God's healing. At that moment the promise of that brother entered me. I did not know then that I would receive the healing medicine by faith. I only knew about God's healing and decided not to remain in the hospital.</p><p>After leaving the hospital, relief was not as steady as it was in the hospital. My temperature was the same, but I could get up and walk around a little and do a little work. While faith was just beginning to establish itself, it was tested. Brother Zhang Gun-jih, who was living in the same house, came down with typhoid fever. He said that when he had a fever earlier, he realized that it was the result of forcing himself to work before he was completely healed. He also said that he learned the lesson that one has to deal with sickness as one deals with sin: the dealing must be thorough. I was afraid after I heard this, and I prayed that the Lord would show me His will and whether or not leaving the hospital was something I had forced upon myself. In the middle of the night, I saw an elderly man with a shining garment walk to my bed and put something white on my right hand. He put his body over mine and spoke something softly like a prayer and then left. I cried out loudly and woke up, and I felt a strange scent permeating my being. I felt that this dream matched His promise very well (Prov. 4:22). The next day I got up and worked as usual. Of course, I did not have the assurance to travel a long distance or to engage myself in difficult work. When Ch'ang-sha was sacked, I retreated with the brothers to Ch'ang-Teh. I had to take a sedan chair. When I arrived in Ch'ang-Teh, the trial became more fierce. Sometimes the cold wind would become very severe, and sometimes I had to walk a long way. In the past I would cough even when I put on a lot of clothing and would feel tired even when I walked a few miles. Now I do not have to wear a fur coat in snowy weather and do not cough at all. I am not tired even when I walk over twenty miles. Faith has been tested, and the fact has proven itself that I am completely healed and recovered to my former health! Hallelujah! He alone is the One who calls things not being as being and who resurrects men from the dead! He alone has done wonderful things, answering the prayers of all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Recently, I have been resting before the Lord and learning to hear His voice. Hebrews 10:5 and 7 have often touched my heart. Since He has prepared a sound body for me, I should walk according to His will. The ministry which He intends for me to receive from Him has been recorded in the Scriptures, the ministry of feeding the lambs and caring for orphans in tribulation. Providentially, I have seen God's provisions. I left the orphanage last year. Since then Brother Kuo Jen-yung has also received a burden for serving the orphans; he has suggested that we embark on this work together. I thought the time was not appropriate, and I suggested that we pray more. When I returned to Ch'ang-Teh, Brother Kuo came from Ch'ang-sha a few days later. He had thought about going to K'un-ming; instead, he returned to Yi-Yang. He came to Ch'ang-sha on the tenth of the month with the intention of traveling from here to Yunnan. After he left, I felt the meeting in Ch'ang-sha and the work of the orphanage deeply pressing upon my spirit. As a result I wrote a letter to him asking whether he had the same leading. I intend to move into the city and give myself to recovering the meeting and to starting a school for the poor on a small scale (gathering less than ten pupils at first). Presently, I am still waiting to see whether this is His pure and good and acceptable will.</p><p>Recently, I received a letter from Sister Chang Ai-teh. She did not escape during the great fire. During the most dangerous moments, she could only trust in the Lord. There was burning on both sides of the Faith Orphanage, but God protected them with His mighty power. When the fire spread next door, the wind turned and the orphanage was preserved, even though there was fire all around. Many unbelievers came to know our God after the fire, and they acknowledged Him as the real and living One. Hallelujah!</p><p>Although the ones meeting in Yi-Yang have been scattered, Brother Chiu Chung-seng and Sister Tzo Teh-en are still there testifying for the Lord in the surrounding areas. The Lord is responsible for protecting them. Brother Yang Dai is still residing in the countryside, but he may move back into the city soon. Brother Zhang Gun-jih moved to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa along with the Lutheran High School.</p><p>Law and order have gradually returned in Ch'ang-Teh. I personally witnessed the bombing on the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of last month. The devastation is great within the city. Although the area around the meeting hall and the Living Stream Teahouse have all been turned to rubble, these two houses have not suffered any damage. Not even a piece of glass in the meeting hall was shattered. A few houses behind the teahouse were bombed, but the bombs did not explode. God has been gracious to us and has perfected the faith of His children in a wonderful way. There are not too many in the meetings, but we still have the Lord's table on the Lord's Day. Brother Han settled in Chou-Shi-Tzen and will be resting there for a while. He will travel to north Hunan and work there next spring. Brothers Shang and Zhu are living with him. Brother Shang said that he has received much light by reading the biography of Madam Guyon, and that he is learning the lesson of not working for the Lord. Brother Zhu still needs your prayer!</p><p>He never fails! He is glad to grant us the grace! May praise and thanksgiving be to Him forever, amen!</p><p>Brother Liu Ai-Wu, December 26</p>
