<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(12)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Lion-Lamb</h2>
<p>In Revelation 5:5-10 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Lion-Lamb. From Revelation 5:1 through 6:1, we see the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God&rsquo;s throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God&rsquo;s universal administration. In Revelation 5 one of the elders introduced Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but when John turned to see Him, he saw a Lamb (vv. 5-6). To the enemy, He is the Lion; to us, the redeemed ones, He is the dear, precious Lamb. Christ is the Lamb accomplishing God&rsquo;s redemption and the Lion fighting for God&rsquo;s kingdom. For God&rsquo;s redemption, He is a Lamb; for God&rsquo;s kingdom, He is a fighting Lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He fought to redeem us, and He won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God&rdquo; (1:29), but in Revelation one of the elders said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah&rdquo; (5:5). In the Gospel of John we see that Christ came in the flesh as the Lamb of God mainly to take away the sin of the world, but in Revelation we see that Christ is the Lion-Lamb not only to take away sin but also to overcome and defeat His enemies.</p>
<p>Christ is both the Lion and the Lamb because we have two main problems&mdash;sin and Satan. Most Christians pay attention only to the problem of sin but neglect that of Satan. Just as the Lamb is versus sin and solves the problem of sin, the Lion is versus Satan and deals with Satan. As the Lamb, Christ has accomplished redemption, having cleansed us from our sins. As the Lion, He has dealt with Satan. He is adequate to meet our needs and to solve our problems. Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>The Lion is not the same as the Lamb. Is our Christ today the Lamb or the Lion? If we love the Lord, He is the Lamb to us, but to those who do not love Him, He is the Lion. He is the Lamb to us and the Lion to the enemy, the world, and the sinful things. Since we do love Him and He is the Lamb to us, why must He also be a Lion? This is because there are still many negative things in us. He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to redeem us, but even after being redeemed, we are still mixed with many negative things. Therefore, He must also be the Lion to deal with these things.</p>
<p>Eventually, our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Lion-Lamb is related to the New Jerusalem, the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. In the New Jerusalem there are not only the flowing Triune God, the Spirit, as the river of water of life but also the tree of life in the river (22:1-2). The tree of life with its fresh and rich supply is the Lion-Lamb. This Lion-Lamb as our tree of life has fresh fruits to be our supply. In this way the New Jerusalem is sustained. This indicates that we receive His fresh and rich supply and consummate the New Jerusalem by drinking the Spirit and eating Christ. We need to daily drink the flowing God, the Spirit, as our river of water of life, and we need to eat the overcoming Lion-Lamb as the tree of life to be our fresh and rich supply.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) Beholding the Lion of the Tribe of Judah</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:5 speaks of Christ as &ldquo;the Lion of the tribe of Judah.&rdquo; The lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy, as prophesied in Genesis 49:8-9. Christ&rsquo;s overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a picture of Jesus Christ. The twenty-two chapters of this book are a single portrait, a &ldquo;painting&rdquo; portraying and depicting Jesus. However, if a painting portrays only the main subject without a background or environment, we may think that the artist is not very skillful. A good painter creates a picture full of meaning. The twenty-two chapters of Revelation are a good painting of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but they also show an environment. Besides the Lion, there are beasts with horns and even a dragon (13:1-2, 11; 12:3). When John saw the situation in heaven, he wept, but when the Lion of the tribe of Judah came, there was great rejoicing (5:3-4, 8-14). Eventually, the Lion as the Lamb marries a bride, the bride becomes a square city, and the Lamb sits on the throne with God (19:7; 21:16; 22:1). The Lion is enthroned in the center of the New Jerusalem as the King of kings and Lord of lords. Then out of this throne flows a river of water of life, bright as crystal, and in the river the tree of life is growing. This is the &ldquo;painting&rdquo; of the divine Lion in the book of Revelation, the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation we should see only one figure, Jesus Christ, because this book is the revelation and unveiling of Jesus Christ. The main figure in the book of Revelation is Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (5:5). If in Revelation we see all the other items but not this Lion, we will certainly miss the mark. In a very real sense, we must turn our eyes away from the frogs, the beasts, the locusts, the dragon, and the serpent; instead, we must turn our eyes upon this Lion. Revelation is the revelation, the unveiling, of this Lion. All the smaller items mentioned in Revelation are the background and environment of the main picture, which is Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Nothing and no one&mdash;including the serpent, the frogs, and the locusts&mdash;can defeat this Lion. To us, the Lion is the redeeming Lamb, but to the enemy, the Lamb is the overcoming Lion. Moreover, He is fully expressed in the lampstands (ch. 1), the great multitude of the redeemed (ch. 7), the bright woman with her man-child (ch. 12), the harvest with its firstfruits (ch. 14), the overcomers on the sea of glass (ch. 15), the bride ready for marriage (ch. 19), the armies (ch. 19), and the New Jerusalem (chs. 21&mdash;22).</p>
<p>Christ is the Lion-Lamb in His ascension. In the scene in the heavens after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, Christ is revealed mainly as the Lion, not as the Lamb. While John was weeping because &ldquo;no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it&rdquo; (5:4), one of the elders said to him, &ldquo;Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals&rdquo; (v. 5). Before the crucifixion, there might have been reason for John to weep. But it was foolish for him to weep after the ascension. Are you weeping today? If you are still weeping, it means that you have not seen the vision of the ascended Christ in Revelation 5. We need to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>Genesis 49:8-9 prophesies concerning Christ as the Lion of Judah, but only in Revelation are we told that Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. The title <em>the Lion of the tribe of Judah</em> signifies Christ as the triumphant King. All living creatures are under Him. None can subdue Him; rather, He subdues everything.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Christ Typified by a Fighting Lion, a Resting Lion,<br />
and a Producing Lioness</h2>
<p>In Genesis 49:8-12, which records Jacob&rsquo;s blessing concerning Judah, there is a prophecy that Christ would come from the tribe of Judah to be a lion in order to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy. In his prophecy Jacob likened Judah to a lion in three aspects: a young lion, a couching lion, and a lioness. Here Christ is typified as a young lion conquering the enemies, a satisfied lion, and a lioness resting in conquest.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Judah is a young lion; / From the prey, my son, you have gone up,&rdquo; and verse 8 says, &ldquo;Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.&rdquo; Here Judah, likened poetically to a young lion, is a type of Christ as the ultimate Overcomer, the fighting, victorious Lion. The young lion in his freshness and strength is for fighting, for seizing the prey. The expression <em>you have gone up</em> implies that the young lion first had to come down from the mountain to the plain to capture his prey. When a lion goes after some prey, he descends from his dwelling place on the mountain, and after he takes the prey, he brings it up the mountain with him to devour it.</p>
<p>This is a picture of the victory of Christ over His enemies in His crucifixion (Col. 2:15; Heb. 2:14). Christ was first the young lion crouching as He waited for His prey. When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was a young lion seizing the prey. The prey He seized on the cross includes the entire world, all the sinners, and even Satan, the serpent. After seizing His prey, He brought His captive to the mountaintop, that is, to the third heaven. This means that from His victory Christ has ascended to the heavens. Ephesians 4:8 says that when Christ ascended to the height, &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; In His ascension Christ led a train of vanquished foes. This train of vanquished foes was Christ&rsquo;s prey. Christ gained the victory, and He put His hand upon Satan&rsquo;s neck. We need to praise the Lord that He has put His hand upon the neck of His enemies. As the young lion, He has overcome all His enemies. Many chapters in the New Testament reveal how Christ came as a young lion, how He went to the cross to seize His prey, and how He ascended to the mountaintop in the third heaven.</p>
<p>Genesis 49:9 goes on to say, &ldquo;He couches, he stretches out like a lion.&rdquo; Christ is also a couching lion, who rests in satisfaction after enjoying His prey. After a lion has enjoyed his prey and has been satisfied, he couches; he lies down to rest in satisfaction. The figure of the couching lion in verse 9 describes Christ as the One enjoying His rest in the heavens. This portrays Christ in the heavens who enjoys what He has accomplished. After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He was satisfied. Thus, He is now resting in the heavens in His satisfaction. This rest and satisfaction are the issue of Christ&rsquo;s victory. Therefore, Christ is now sitting on the throne in the heavens. According to the poetry of Genesis 49:9, after devouring His prey, Christ was satisfied and couched to enjoy His rest.</p>
<p>We need to see and experience Christ not only as a young lion but also as a couching lion who lies down to rest. We may be troubled by many kinds of enemies&mdash;our temper, our problems, and our weaknesses&mdash;but we need to see that our enemies have already become a prey to our Christ. He went to the cross and captured them, and in resurrection He led a train of vanquished foes to the heavens for His enjoyment. Now in the heavens He is no longer fighting; He is couching. He is lying down to rest, and we are experiencing Him as a resting lion. He is couching, and we also are resting. We need not be troubled by anything; instead, we simply need to enjoy this victorious, satisfied, and resting Christ.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 5:5, the Lion of the tribe of Judah &ldquo;has overcome.&rdquo; This verse does not say that our Christ will overcome; it says that He has already overcome. He has captured the prey and swallowed him. All the enemies have been devoured by Christ. Today Christ is not the fighting One; He is a couching One, the resting One sitting in the heavens. If we see this, we will forget our enemies, our temper, and the troubles caused by others, and we will say, &ldquo;Lord, I worship You and praise You! Lord, You were the young, fighting lion. But today You are resting in the heavens as the victorious lion. And now I am partaking of all that You have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Genesis 49:9 Christ is also likened to a lioness. A lioness, a female lion, is for producing baby lions. Christ is not only the fighting lion and the resting lion but also the producing lioness who brought forth many overcomers as His &ldquo;lion cubs.&rdquo; Christ is our mother lion, and we are His lion cubs. We need to see that we have been made lion cubs. When the enemy troubles us, we should realize that we are baby lions. Today, not only is Christ the Lion; we also are lions.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the church is lion country, and everyone in the church is a baby lion. If we see the situation from God&rsquo;s viewpoint, we will realize that in the eyes of God the church is a country of lions. Toward men we are lambs following the Lamb, but toward Satan we are lion cubs. Although we may not have such a realization, Satan recognizes this fact. He knows that all the believers are lion cubs. Frequently we need to tell Satan, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t touch me. Don&rsquo;t you know that my family is the lion family?&rdquo; Christ is the young lion, the couching lion, and the reproducing lioness; we are His lion cubs. This is the full victory of Christ. This is why Genesis 49:8 says that Christ, typified by Judah, is to be praised and worshipped.</p>
<p>The last part of Genesis 49:9 says of Judah, &ldquo;Who will rouse him up?&rdquo; This means, &ldquo;Who dares to rouse him?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who dares to defy Him?&rdquo; That no one dares to rouse Judah up signifies that Christ&rsquo;s terrifying power in His resurrection and ascension has subdued everything (Matt. 28:18; Phil. 2:9; Eph. 1:21-22).</p><h2 class="head5">3) Bearing the Face of a Lion and<br />
Reigning for God as Lions</h2>
<p>People often consider that the Lord Jesus was gentle and mild. However, at least on certain occasions He was not at all gentle. For example, when He went into the temple and found &ldquo;those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there,&rdquo; He became angry and made a whip out of cords and &ldquo;drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables&rdquo; (John 2:14-15). Furthermore, in Matthew 23 He severely rebuked the religionists, saying to them, &ldquo;Serpents! Brood of vipers!&rdquo; (v. 33). In the Bible a lion signifies boldness, vigor, strength, and victory. In these situations He surely was as bold as a lion.</p>
<p>There are times in our Christian life when we also need to have the face of a lion. For example, some may invite us to participate with them in a certain kind of worldly amusement. At such a time we should behave like a lion. This means that toward anything sinful or worldly, we must be as bold as a lion. All our acquaintances should know that if they talk to us about worldly things, we will behave like a lion.</p>
<p>In the Bible a lion signifies not only boldness, vigor, strength, and victory but also reigning. The lion is the king of the animals. This means that we should be lions to reign for God (Rom. 5:17). If toward sin, the world, and Satan we are strong and bold like lions, God will be able to establish His reign through us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Root of David</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:5 also speaks of Christ as &ldquo;the Root of David.&rdquo; The title <em>Root of David</em> (He is also the Root of David&rsquo;s father, Jesse&mdash;Isa. 11:1, 10) signifies that Christ is the source of David. Therefore, David, His forefather, called Him &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 22:42-45). Christ is not only the seed, the offspring, and the descendant of David, who came out of David; He is also the Root of David, out from whom David came. In our concept, Christ was born of David; hence, He was a descendant of David. But Revelation 5:5 says that Christ is the Root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ. The Bible also says that Christ is the Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5). Hence, He is both the Root and the Shoot.</p>
<p>While in Revelation 5 we see that Christ is the &ldquo;Root of David,&rdquo; in Isaiah 11:1 and 10 we see that Christ is also a sprout and branch of Jesse. This indicates that Christ is the source of Jesse and also the source of Jesse&rsquo;s son David. Isaiah 11:10 says, &ldquo;In that day the root of Jesse, / Who stands as a banner to the peoples&mdash; / Him will the nations seek.&rdquo; <em>Root</em> denotes the source, the origin. The root of Jesse typifies Christ as the source, the origin, of Jesse. In the prophecies in Isaiah we see that Christ in His divinity is the Shoot of Jehovah and the root of Jesse; we also see that Christ in His humanity is the sprout coming forth from the stump of Jesse, the branch from the root of Jesse, the tender plant that grows, and the root out of dry ground (53:2). In His divinity Christ came out of God; therefore, God is His origin. Hence, Christ is the source, the origin, of Jesse. In His humanity Christ came out of Jesse; therefore, Jesse is His origin, His source. He is the sprout and branch of Jesse, and He is also the root of Jesse. He is everything concerning Jesse. According to His humanity, He came out of Jesse; according to His divinity, He brought forth Jesse.</p>
<p>Christ is both a descendant and the root of David. In the eyes of God, David was the unique person who fought the battle and gained authority, fighting the battle for God and gaining His full authority. That Christ, the Lion-Lamb, is the root of this person means that He is greater than David. This is why He holds the key of David (Rev. 3:7). Whatever David was, had, and did was altogether out of this root. Therefore, as the Root of David, Christ is more powerful and more victorious than David and has more of God&rsquo;s divine authority.</p>
<p>In Matthew 22:41-46 Christ questioned the Pharisees in His wisdom. These verses say, &ldquo;Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David&rsquo;s. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet&rsquo;? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.&rdquo; On the one hand, Christ is the Son of David who came out of David, and on the other hand, He is the Lord of David, the Root of David out from whom David came. Christ is the wonderful One who is everything: He is the root, the branch, and the sprout. He is the Son, yet He is the source.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s response to the Pharisees in Matthew 22:43-45 muzzled the mouths of His opposers. Christ is not only the son of David, the Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5; 33:15), but also the Lord of David, the Root of David. As a descendant of David in His humanity, Christ is the Shoot of David, who issued out of David. But as the eternal God in His divinity, Christ is the Root of David, the source of David. Christ is also our redeeming Lamb in this present age. As such an all-inclusive One, He has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(13)</h1>
<p>In this message, we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Lion-Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Having Overcome to Open the Scroll<br />
and Its Seven Seals</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:5 says that Christ &ldquo;has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals.&rdquo; As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ overcame and defeated the rebellious Satan, the enemy of God, and as the redeeming Lamb, He took away the sin of fallen man. By doing so, He removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, He is worthy to open the scroll concerning God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Christ has overcome all that is needed to open the scroll and its seven seals. Here the scroll is the new covenant, the new testament, with God&rsquo;s economy hidden in such a sealed book. This scroll is sealed with seven seals. The scroll is the new covenant enacted by the Lord Jesus with His own blood for the whole universe. Without this scroll, this covenant, the universe could not exist. All the mysteries and all the things that happen in the created universe are recorded in this scroll. When Christ ascended to the heavens, He took the scroll from God and opened the secret of the universe for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. Christ as the Redeemer accomplished all that is needed to open up God&rsquo;s economy. Thus, only Christ as the redeeming Lamb and overcoming Lion is qualified to open the scroll with its seven seals.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Lamb Standing as Having Just Been Slain, Having Seven Horns and Seven Eyes,<br />
Which Are the Seven Spirits of God</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Lamb Standing as Having Just Been Slain</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:6 speaks of &ldquo;a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.&rdquo; Christ is not only a Lion but also a Lamb (v. 5). To Satan and all the enemies Christ is a Lion, but to us, the redeemed ones, He is a redeeming Lamb. We may be afraid of a lion, but we would feel loving toward a lamb.</p>
<p>The expression <em>having just been slain</em> in verse 6 indicates that the Lamb had just been slain and also that the scene in the heavens that is depicted in this chapter took place immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension into the heavens. After Christ passed through death, resurrection, and ascension, He stood in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures. There was a resurrected Lamb standing before the throne in heaven. This standing Lamb is resurrection (John 11:25). Resurrection hinges on Him, depends on Him, and is in Him.</p>
<p>In Revelation 5, when John looked, what he saw was a Lamb with seven eyes. This Lion-Lamb was standing, not sitting, and His seven eyes were flashing. This indicates that His work was not finished. What was finished in John 19 was the work of redemption (v. 30). But His standing position and His seven flashing eyes both indicate that He is taking action. In other words, as far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down at the right hand of God in the heavens after His ascension (Heb. 1:3; 10:12); however, regarding the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration, He is still standing in His ascension.</p>
<p>The redeeming Lamb is now standing at the center of the universe, before God&rsquo;s throne. This reveals that the Redeemer is now in God&rsquo;s administration. He is the Administrator of the universe, executing God&rsquo;s economy. He is not sitting or sleeping there; instead, He is standing, and His seven eyes are flashing, watching, searching, and even burning. The whole universe is watching this scene. The four living creatures, the twenty-four elders, myriads of angels, and all other creatures are wide-awake, alert, and observing. These are the circumstances in which they proclaim, &ldquo;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever&rdquo; (Rev. 5:13). There is a Lion-Lamb standing in the center of the universe with seven flashing, burning eyes. He saves us from our silence, coldness, and laziness. Our vision must be uplifted to see this Lamb accomplishing a work of eternally vast dimensions.</p>
<p>In His earthly ministry Christ accomplished redemption; now in His heavenly ministry He is accomplishing God&rsquo;s building work. Actually, redemption is for God&rsquo;s building. The center of God&rsquo;s building is the church, and the ultimate consummation of this building is the New Jerusalem. Today the church is a house, the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), but this house will consummate in a city, the New Jerusalem. When this takes place, God&rsquo;s building will be completed. The work of redemption was finished in John 19. A few chapters later, in Acts 2, the work of God&rsquo;s building began. This building work continues today.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry began from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit and ended in His resurrection (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18-19; Mark 16:9a, 19). The major items in the section of His earthly ministry are His human living, His crucifixion, and His resurrection. In His earthly ministry He ministered as the Lamb (John 1:29). As the Lamb in His earthly ministry, Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s full redemption for us by being slain on the cross to die the all-inclusive death according to God&rsquo;s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry began from His outpouring of the Holy Spirit and will end in His second appearing on the earth (Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33; Heb. 9:28b; 2 Tim. 4:1b). The major items in the section of His heavenly ministry are to take care of the church to make it a glorious church, to enforce the new covenant and execute the new testament, to minister to the believers as the High Priest, the Advocate, and the Minister in the heavens, to come back, and to transfigure His believers. In His heavenly ministry He ministers as the Lion-Lamb (Rev. 5:5-7). The Lion-Lamb indicates that the Christ who was the Redeemer has become a Victor as the Lion. In His heavenly ministry, as such a Victor, He will conquer all His enemies and bring in His kingdom to this earth.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Having Seven Horns and Seven Eyes,<br />
Which Are the Seven Spirits of God</h2>
<p>In Revelation 5:6 John says that the Lamb has seven horns. Horns signify strength in fighting (Deut. 33:17). Christ is the redeeming Lamb, yet He has horns for fighting. He is the fighting Redeemer. His fighting is complete (perfect and complete) in God&rsquo;s move, as signified by the number seven.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:6 also says that the Lamb has &ldquo;seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.&rdquo; Eyes are for observing and searching. When we look at others, we search them out. We can tell what their attitude is, what kind of persons they are, and how they feel. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in Zechariah 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, the topstone (4:7) with seven eyes for God&rsquo;s building. According to Greek grammar, the antecedent of <em>which</em> in Revelation 5:6 is <em>seven eyes</em>. Hence, the seven Spirits of God refer only to the seven eyes of the Lamb, not to His seven horns. The seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth (Zech. 4:10).</p>
<h2 class="head6">a) The Son and the Spirit Being Inseparable</h2>
<p>That the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God means that one of the three of the Godhead is the eyes of another of the Trinity. This contradicts an erroneous teaching concerning the Divine Trinity, which holds that since the three persons of the Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;must not be confused, they are not only distinct but also separate. Such a teaching is inaccurate and is merely according to the natural human mind. Instead of trying to understand the Triune God according to our human mind, we must understand Him according to the teaching of the Bible. The fact that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God indicates that the Spirit is the eyes of the Son. Our eyes are not separate from us; rather, they are a part of our being. Likewise, since the seven Spirits of God (the Holy Spirit) are the seven eyes of Christ (the Son of God), the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet not separate from each other.</p>
<p>That Christ, the Son of God, cannot be separated from the seven Spirits of God, the Spirit, is indicated not only by the inseparability of the eyes of the Lamb from the Lamb in Revelation 5 but also by the inseparability of the living water (signifying the Spirit) from the smitten rock (signifying the crucified Christ) in Exodus 17, out of which the water flowed. In Exodus 17 Moses was instructed to strike the rock with his staff, and the water flowed out of the smitten rock. The striking of the rock is a clear, complete, and full picture of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. The rock was struck by the staff of Moses (v. 5). In this type, Moses signifies the law, and the staff represents the power and authority of the law. Hence, the striking of the rock by Moses&rsquo; staff signifies that Christ was put to death on the cross by the authority of God&rsquo;s law (cf. Gal. 2:19-20a; 3:13). Moreover, the water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit (John 7:37-39). This indicates that the Holy Spirit is the flowing out of Christ. When Christ is infused into us, He is the Spirit. It is through the eyes that one person is infused into another person. When a person infuses himself through his eyes, he infuses the reality of what he is. In the same way, the Spirit as the reality of Christ is infused into the saints. Hence, there is no way to separate the Spirit from Christ. Separating Christ from the Spirit is like separating the living water from the smitten rock. Once we separate the living water from the rock, the living water is without a source, and the rock is without a flow, for the living water is the flow of the rock, and the rock is the source of the living water. The living water and the rock are two yet one; they are indivisible, just as the eyes and the body are inseparable. Hence, the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet inseparable.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Lamb having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits, indicates that Christ comes to us as the seven eyes, that is, as the Spirit, for us to experience. Moreover, the Lamb is on the throne, from the throne flows the river of water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2). This is a picture of the redeeming Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit constantly flowing with the life supply. By this, we can see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit not only for us to know and understand but also for us to take, experience, and enjoy. We need to enjoy Christ by realizing Him as the Spirit. The seven Spirits of God are for the imparting of life because the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Therefore, we must exercise not only our mind to understand Him but also our spirit to contact Him in our spirit, as revealed in the Epistles (v. 4).</p><h2 class="head6">b) Judging, Observing, Infusing, and Guiding Eyes</h2>
<p>Revelation is a book of the seven Spirits, the seven eyes of Christ, whereby the redeeming, overcoming, and building Christ transfuses Himself into all His members. While He is transfusing Himself into us, He is searching, enlightening, judging, purifying, and refining us. In this way He transforms us. This is God&rsquo;s recovery today.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s eyes cannot be separated from him, for a person&rsquo;s eyes are his expression. Our inner being is mainly expressed through our eyes. In like manner, the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ by which Christ expresses Himself. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the expression of the Son. The seven eyes of Christ, the seven Spirits of God, are Christ&rsquo;s expression in a judging way in God&rsquo;s move for God&rsquo;s building. Even now, Christ&rsquo;s burning eyes are flaming over us to enlighten, search, refine, and judge us, not that we might be condemned but that we might be purged, transformed, and conformed to His image for God&rsquo;s building (v. 29; 12:4-5). The Lord&rsquo;s judgment is motivated by love. Because He loves the church, He comes to search, enlighten, judge, refine, and purify us in order to transform us into precious stones. Eventually, this book consummates in the New Jerusalem, which is built with precious materials that come from the seven eyes of Christ, that is, from the life-giving, transforming Spirit.</p>
<p>The seven Spirits, as the intensification of the Triune God, are the seven eyes of the Lion-Lamb to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The Triune God is embodied in the Son and is realized and consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the seven Spirits, the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation, He finalizes His New Testament economy. Our Savior, the Lion-Lamb, stands before the throne and takes the scroll to execute God&rsquo;s economy. His seven eyes are the seven Spirits as the executors carrying out His administration. Today the whole world is under the authority of our Redeemer.</p>
<p>The seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are parts of God&rsquo;s administration in His judgment (Rev. 5:1; 8:2; 15:7). Therefore, in the book of Revelation the number seven signifies administration in judgment. This gives us the meaning of the seven Spirits. The Spirit of God in Revelation is mentioned as the seven Spirits because here He is not the Spirit of grace but the Spirit for the divine administration through the divine judgment. The Spirit is the seven eyes of the Lamb that can see into things clearly and the seven lamps that are burning and full of light. None of us can hide anything from the seven eyes of the Lamb. When the Lamb with the seven eyes looks at us, everything is exposed and searched out. By the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire, we experience something shining in us to search out every secret of our entire life. Anything that is brought into the light is exposed. These searching and enlightening eyes of the Lord are for judgment. The seven Spirits of God are the burning fire and the searching eyes to search, enlighten, and judge.</p>
<p>The seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6 are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne in Revelation 4:5. The center of the universe is the throne. On this throne there is the one God, and before this throne there are seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of God, the seven Spirits of God. These seven Spirits come out of God by shining and observing through Christ, who was slain and resurrected. The shining and observing seven Spirits are sent forth into all the earth to observe everyone in every corner. Wherever the seven Spirits look, there is blessing and there is the shining of God&rsquo;s lamps of fire, and wherever God&rsquo;s lamps of fire shine, there is the burning of the fire of God. The fire of God is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is God Himself. Wherever there are God&rsquo;s lamps of fire, there is the presence of God, and wherever there are God&rsquo;s lamps of fire, there is God Himself. Eventually, the result of the burning of the fire of God will be a group of people who are completely the same as God.</p>
<p>Wherever there is the shining of God&rsquo;s lamps of fire, there is the burning of fire, and wherever there is the burning of fire, there is the filling of the Spirit. In Acts, when the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, He was like tongues of fire (2:3). The Lord Jesus also said that He came to cast fire on the earth (Luke 12:49). That fire is the Spirit of God, God Himself. When the Lord Jesus came, He brought God to the earth so that man may receive God. God in the Lamb is the lamps of fire and the flames, and both the lamps and the flames are the eyes.</p>
<p>When the Spirit observes us, we sense that He is like light that shines upon us. This shining gives us the feeling that we are being burned&mdash;everything that should not be in us is burned away and consumed. On the other hand, this fire within us also acts as a motivating power that drives us from within. This experience fills us with the presence of the Spirit. The Spirit is Christ (2 Cor. 3:17), and Christ is God (Rom. 9:5). Thus, when we are filled with the Spirit, we are filled with the element of God, and this element, which is God Himself, is a consuming fire. The result of such burning is that we have the splendor of God, the appearance of God, and the radiance of God so that we become exactly the same as God (Rev. 4:3; 21:11, 18-19).</p>
<p>The seven Spirits of God as the seven eyes of the Lamb are also for observing. If we were to keep our eyes upon a certain person, it would indicate that we mean business with him. This is an intimate, dear visitation. The Lord Jesus today has seven eyes. While He was on earth, He had only two eyes when He looked at Peter. But today when Christ comes to see us, He has seven eyes. This means that today the Lord&rsquo;s visitation is more serious and intensified. Yes, our Lord is the redeeming Lamb. But this Lamb has seven eyes, and His seven eyes are seven burning lamps. In one sense He is visiting us, and in another sense He is observing us and burning us. This is the reality of the sevenfold intensified Spirit today.</p>
<p>When we attend a church meeting, we are under a special kind of observation. Just by going to one meeting, we may begin to sense the living observation of the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Before we attend the meeting, we may speak freely, but after the meeting Christ regulates our speaking. In the evening some kind of inner voice within us may urge us to go to a meeting. It may not be our natural preference to go, but we cannot avoid going. Then when we arrive at the meeting, we touch the living Christ. The burning, searching, enlightening, and observing reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in the churches.</p>
<p>Moreover, the seven eyes of the Lamb are for transfusing and infusing. After the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire burn within us, in our experience they become seven eyes. Eyes are the loveliest part of a person. If a person closes his eyes, we cannot see what is lovely in him. A person&rsquo;s loveliness is in his eyes. After we experience the burning, judging, and purifying, the burning lamps of fire become the lovely eyes. We may wonder whether these seven eyes are fearful or lovely. One may say that they are sometimes fearful and sometimes lovely. Yet whether the Lord&rsquo;s eyes are fearful or lovely depends not on Him but on us. If we live properly as children of God, His eyes will be lovely, but if we are disobedient, His eyes will be fearful. Regardless of whether His transfusion is that of love or of fear, as He looks at us with His eyes, God is transfused into us.</p>
<p>Whenever the Lord looks at us, we receive a precious infusion. When one person looks at another person, he transfuses his feeling into that person. A person&rsquo;s eyes are the expression of his inner being. To transfuse is to transmit a person&rsquo;s inner being into the one whom he is looking at (cf. 2 Cor. 2:10). The seven Spirits are the seven eyes by which Christ expresses Himself. As the Lord looks at us, His seven eyes transfuse Himself into us. Whenever the Lord looks at us with His eyes, we can understand if He is happy or unhappy. There is no need for Him to say anything. By looking at us, He transfuses all that He is into our being. His seven eyes are gazing at us to infuse God into us.</p>
<p>Transformation is the transfusing of the Lord&rsquo;s lovable person into us (3:16-18). The church is the place where the Lord transfuses His inner being into us for our transformation (Rom. 12:2). Experiencing the transfusion of God is the reality of the church (cf. vv. 4-5). The church is a group of people who have experienced God&rsquo;s transfusion. This is the nature of the church; without the transfusion of God, we do not have the church. The seven eyes of the Lamb are in the church; hence, in order to receive the transfusion of the seven eyes, we must be in the church. The more a meeting is full of the nature of the church, the more it is full of the operation of the Spirit, which is the seven Spirits transfusing and infusing. The Spirit is life, and the seven Spirits are for us to receive the supply of life and to be equipped in life. The lamps have become the fire, the fire has become the eyes, and the eyes are the Spirit. God first shines within us, then He burns in us, and then He transfuses and infuses Himself into us. The issue is that we have the supply of life and are equipped with life. Eventually, our function is manifested in the church, and we grow in life and are built up together with others. As a result, we are not merely the church but the functioning church in which all the saints minister. We not only are enlightened, burned, and infused; we also receive the supply of life and are equipped in life. Thus, we become the functioning members in the Body.</p>
<p>The Lord also guides us with His eyes. Second Chronicles 16:9 says, &ldquo;The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout all the earth.&rdquo; Today God&rsquo;s eyes are running to and fro, seeking those whose heart is perfect toward Him. Psalm 32:8 says, &ldquo;I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go; / I will counsel you; my eye is upon you.&rdquo; The guiding of the eyes is the most intimate kind, and it is used by those who are intimate. When two very intimate people speak with one another, they may not necessarily use their mouth; instead, they may use their eyes. The Lord guides us not mainly with words or other indications but with His eyes.</p><h2 class="head6">c) The Seven Eyes of the Lamb Being Seven Lamps<br />
of the Lampstands for the Testimony of Jesus</h2>
<p>The seven eyes of the Lamb as the Executor of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are the seven lamps upheld by the seven lampstands, the seven churches, shining and enlightening as the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:9b, 11-12). This burning, judging, purifying, refining, and producing Spirit is the lamps upheld by the lampstands, the churches. This means that the churches shine through the lamps and that these lamps are the Spirit, the real testimony. The seven Spirits today are judging, purifying, refining, and bringing forth the churches. The extent to which the seven Spirits refine is the extent to which the churches shine. If we do not allow the seven Spirits to refine us, the seven Spirits have no way to shine, and there is no testimony. The shining of the seven Spirits is the testimony. The more we let the Spirit purify us and refine us, the more He shines through us, and this shining is the testimony of the churches. This is why we need to open ourselves and welcome Him every day to enter into our being to refine, judge, purge, and purify us. Then He will shine through us, and this shining is the testimony of the church, the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus is the shining of the seven Spirits from within all the believers in the churches.</p>
<p>We should pray, &ldquo;Dear divine Flame, come and judge! Come and purify! Come and refine that You may produce the golden lampstand.&rdquo; By His mercy, we need to be open to Him. Every day we need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Come. I am open to You. I open every avenue of my being to You. Enlighten me, search me within, and expose me. I want to be enlightened by You and exposed in Your light.&rdquo; Instead of shutting ourselves up and hiding from Him, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, we are open. Come and shine upon us, and shine from within us and enlighten every avenue and every corner of our being. We desire to be exposed, purged, and purified.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head6">d) The Seven Eyes of the Lamb Being the Seven Eyes<br />
of the Stone for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>The seven eyes are mentioned not only in Revelation 5:6 but also in Zechariah 3:9 and 4:10. Zechariah 3:9 says, &ldquo;Here is the stone that I have set before Joshua&mdash;upon one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo; The reference to engraving the stone indicates that this stone is Christ. The Lord Jesus, as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people. In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God&rsquo;s people. This corresponds to John 1:29, which says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; From Zechariah 3:9 we know that the stone with the seven eyes is Christ. In short, the stone with seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9 is the Lamb with seven eyes in Revelation 5:6.</p>
<p>Zechariah 4:2 says, &ldquo;There is a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on top of it and its seven lamps upon it, with seven pipes for each of the lamps on top of it.&rdquo; In Zechariah 3:9 the building stone has seven eyes, and in this verse the lampstand has seven lamps. This reveals that the lampstand equals the stone. Both the stone and the lampstand are Christ. The stone is for the building, and the lampstand is for light, for enlightening. On the stone there are seven eyes, and on the lampstand there are seven lamps. Hence, the seven lamps of the lampstand must be the seven eyes on the stone.</p>
<p>Zechariah 4:10 tells us that the seven eyes on the stone are the &ldquo;eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth.&rdquo; This verse corresponds to Revelation 5:6, which speaks of the seven eyes of the Lamb, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. This indicates that the seven eyes of God are the seven Spirits of God. Zechariah 4:4-6 also implies that the seven eyes, which are the seven lamps, are related to the Spirit. After speaking of seven lamps upon a golden lampstand in verse 2, Zechariah asked an angel in verse 4, &ldquo;What are these?&rdquo; Here, in effect, Zechariah was asking what the significance of the one lampstand with seven lamps is. In verse 6 the angel answered, &ldquo;This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.&rdquo; This clearly indicates the one lampstand with seven lamps is &ldquo;My Spirit,&rdquo; the Spirit of God. Here the seven lamps signify the seven Spirits of God. This is because the book of Revelation indicates that the seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps, are the seven Spirits of God. As we have seen, Zechariah reveals that the seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps on the lampstand, are also the seven eyes of the stone. By means of the seven eyes, Christ as the Lion and the Lamb unveiled in Revelation 5 is connected to the stone spoken of in Zechariah 3. Therefore, the One with the seven eyes is not only the Lion-Lamb but also the stone. He is the Lion-Lamb-stone; the Lion to destroy the enemy, the Lamb to redeem us, and the stone to build God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, the expression, of God (John 1:1). One day God, expressed as the Word, became flesh (v. 14). This was His first step to enlarge Himself. This flesh was the Lamb of the righteous God, the God who judges and condemns sin. The Lamb took away sin to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. This was the second step of God&rsquo;s enlargement. When He was crucified, He was engraved, and this engraving removed the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people in one day. In addition to this, He is also the Lion, indicating that He has defeated all the enemies. As the Lion He has accomplished an absolute defeat of the enemy. He is both the redeeming Lamb and the overcoming Lion for the enlargement of God. This Lion-Lamb is now the stone. Today the Lord Jesus is the stone. He is the Lamb and the Lion in order to be the stone. Having removed the iniquity and having defeated all the enemies, He is now building. This age is not the age merely of the Lamb and of the Lion; it is mainly the age of the stone. Now we can understand why, in His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus indicated to the Jewish builders that they were rejecting not only the redeeming Lamb and the overcoming Lion but also the stone, the head cornerstone. After His death and resurrection, the age became the age of the church, which is God&rsquo;s building. For the building of the church, Christ is the rock. As He Himself told Peter, &ldquo;You are a stone, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18, lit.). This is the age of the stone, the age of building.</p>
<p>The Lamb&rsquo;s seven flaming, searching, and enlightening eyes are not only for God&rsquo;s judgment but also for His building. The Bible tells us clearly that these seven eyes are the seven lamps (Zech. 3:9; 4:2, 10). The seven lamps in Exodus 25 are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle. Without light, it is impossible to move. The light is for the move, and the move is for God&rsquo;s building. The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place among men on earth. The seven lamps in Zechariah 3 and 4 are for the recovery of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The same is true of the book of Revelation. The seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps before God&rsquo;s throne, are for God&rsquo;s building. Revelation begins with the seven local churches and ends with the New Jerusalem. Although this book contains the judgment of God, this judgment is not the goal. Judgment is a procedure that will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Apparently, the seven flaming eyes of the Lamb are for searching and judging. However, this searching and judging is a procedure to attain the consummate goal of building. The New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment carried out by the seven flaming eyes of the Lamb. Thus, the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits are all for God&rsquo;s building. The transfusing by the seven eyes, the imparting of life by the seven Spirits of God, and the enlightening, searching, exposing, and judging by the seven lamps are all for the New Jerusalem. We are here for the realization of God&rsquo;s eternal goal in His divine building.</p>
<p>The accomplishment of God&rsquo;s building requires His judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment is carried out by Christ&rsquo;s being the One with seven flaming eyes to burn, enlighten, search, purify, and refine us. Eventually, these flaming eyes infuse us with all that He is, metabolically transforming us into His being. The whole city of New Jerusalem will have the same essence and appearance as God. The appearance of God sitting on the throne in chapter 4 is of jasper (v. 3), and the appearance of the New Jerusalem, especially its wall, in chapter 21 is also of jasper (vv. 11, 18-19). Thus, the essence and appearance of God and of the city are the same. This can be accomplished by having God wrought into us by means of transfusion.</p>
<h2 class="head6">e) God, the Lamb, the Stone, and the Lampstand</h2>
<p>God became the redeeming Lamb who died and resurrected to become the building stone; this building stone is the lampstand with seven eyes, seven Spirits, and seven lamps to produce the church. This golden lampstand is the church. The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, and these seven eyes are also on the stone. According to Zechariah, this stone is for God&rsquo;s building. Eventually we see that the stone with the seven eyes is the lampstand. In the book of Revelation we see that the seven eyes of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb. The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. This means that the lampstand equals the stone, the stone equals the Lamb, and the Lamb equals God. In Exodus we have a lampstand with seven lamps. In Zechariah we see that these seven lamps are the seven eyes of God and the seven eyes of the stone. The book of Revelation indicates that these seven eyes are also the seven eyes of the Lamb. The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes of the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. This proves that the lampstand is God, that God is the stone, and that the stone is the Lamb. The lampstand is the stone, the stone is the Lamb, and the Lamb is God. These four things&mdash;the lampstand, the stone, the Lamb, and God&mdash;are four in one. The lampstand is for shining, the stone is for building, the Lamb is for redeeming, and God is for administrating. Therefore, we have the shining lampstand, the building stone, the redeeming Lamb, and the administrating God.</p>
<p>The seven lamps of the shining lampstand are the seven eyes of the building stone, the seven eyes of the building stone are the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb, and the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb are the seven eyes of the administrating God. These seven lamps and these seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God. In the present age the Spirit is the seven Spirits of God who are the seven lamps of fire burning for God&rsquo;s administration and also the seven eyes of the redeeming and building One for transfusion and infusion. The lamps of burning fire are for God&rsquo;s administration, and the eyes are for the redeeming and building One&rsquo;s transfusion. On the one hand, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining, burning, searching, judging, and carrying out God&rsquo;s administration. On the other hand, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the redeeming and building Christ to infuse whatever Christ is into us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">e. Taking the Scroll out of the Right Hand of Him<br />
Who Sits upon the Throne</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:7 says, &ldquo;He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne.&rdquo; Christ took the scroll out of the right hand of God the Father who sits upon the throne. This scroll must be the new covenant, the grand title deed in the universe, enacted with the blood of the Lamb for God&rsquo;s redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Being Worthy to Take the Scroll and<br />
to Open Its Seals, Being Slain<br />
and Having Purchased for God by His Blood Men<br />
out of Every Tribe and Tongue and People and Nation and Having Made Them a Kingdom and Priests to God,<br />
and Their Reigning on the Earth</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) Being Worthy to Take the Scroll<br />
and to Open Its Seals</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:9 says of Christ, &ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals.&rdquo; In the whole universe no one is worthy to open the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy but Christ, the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb. As the overcoming Lion, He defeated Satan for God, and as the redeeming Lamb, He put sin away for us. He is the only One qualified to unveil and carry out the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Our Savior is the Lamb as well as the Lion. This One is worthy to open the scroll. Apart from Him, no one in the universe is worthy to open the secret, the mystery, of God&rsquo;s economy. But the Lion-Lamb is worthy because He has accomplished redemption and has won the victory over Satan. As the One who has brought God&rsquo;s authority to the earth, He is the victorious, overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb who has accomplished a full redemption for God&rsquo;s chosen people. Therefore, He is completely qualified and positioned to open the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy. When Christians say that Christ is worthy, their thought is that He is worthy to receive worship, praise, and thanks from us, His little creatures. However, most Christians fail to realize that He is worthy to open the seals of the secret of God&rsquo;s economy. This aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s worthiness is universal and immeasurable. Of course, Christ is worthy of our praises; He is worthy even of our lives. Nevertheless, we must realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ&rsquo;s worthiness is a matter of His being qualified to open the secret of God&rsquo;s economy. The universe is a mystery which the scientists cannot unravel. They simply do not know the meaning or the purpose of the universe because it is a secret kept from them. But Christ is worthy to open this secret, for He is worthy to open the seals of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>A scroll is a roll of parchment paper or other material. Because a scroll is rolled up, it is difficult to determine just how long it is. The scroll in Revelation 5 is eternally long. Only Christ is worthy to open this eternally-long scroll. We should not think that we have seen everything contained in this scroll. We will need eternity to see all that is included in it. When we are in the New Jerusalem, we will still be reading the contents of the scroll. For eternity we will say, &ldquo;Now I see something more.&rdquo; The surprise of the opening of the scroll will last for eternity. When we are in eternity, we may say, &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s surprise is eternal. Although we are now in eternity, we still cannot see the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ has received from God the authority to administrate the entire universe (vv. 1, 6-7). Christ is the real Administrator of the heavens and all the nations on earth. In Matthew 28:18 the Lord told the disciples that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. In Revelation 5 Christ as the Lamb of God was standing in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders. The One who was sitting on the throne was holding a scroll sealed with seven seals. God was sitting on the throne holding this scroll, the schedule of His administration in the entire universe. This scroll is like a timetable of what will take place from the ascension of Christ to the New Jerusalem. The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually its contents. These seven seals are the seven secrets of the universe, which are the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ as the Lion-Lamb is qualified to open the scroll, that is, to open the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy and to carry it out. This indicates that Christ is the One who has received the authority to administrate the entire universe. We all must worship Christ as the Administrator, as the One in the heavens administering all things for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In Revelation 5 Christ is presented as the redeeming Lamb who is the Victor, qualified to take the scroll, open it, and execute it. In the Epistles of Paul, the scroll is the new testament mainly for our enjoyment of the riches of Christ, which have been bequeathed to us. However, there is another aspect to the new testament: God deals with the universe according to His testament. How God deals with all peoples, including the Jews, the nations, and Christendom, will be according to His testament. In this testament there are not only bequests for the believers to enjoy but also the matters of God&rsquo;s dealing with different peoples and even with the heavens and the earth. The Redeemer of the whole universe is qualified to take, open, and execute the new testament.</p>
<p>Eventually, all things in the universe will be headed up in Christ (Eph. 1:10). The Jews, the heathen nations, and Christendom will be dealt with, and God&rsquo;s kingdom will be ushered in on the earth. When all things are headed up in Christ, there will be the fullness of the times, in which the heavens, the earth, and everything therein will be new. Today things on the earth are confused, dark, and under death, causing many to shed tears. A day will come, however, when the whole universe will be in order, and there will be no more division, confusion, darkness, death, or tears. There will be a new heaven and a new earth in which all things will be headed up in Christ. In eternity all things in the universe will be in order. Christ alone is worthy to administrate the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem. This is because only Christ is the One who died to redeem the whole universe, who conquered Satan through His death, who consummated the covenant with His redeeming blood, and who bequeathed the new testament to us. Christ is worthy to take up the scroll of the new testament, open it up, and execute all that is written therein by carrying out every bequest in the new testament and bringing all things in the universe into order. This is Christ&rsquo;s ultimate heavenly ministry to carry out all that God has designed in His economy.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Being Slain and Having Purchased for God by His Blood Men out of Every Tribe and Tongue and People and Nation and Having Made Them a Kingdom and Priests to God,<br />
and Their Reigning on the Earth</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:9-10 goes on to say of Christ, &ldquo;You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s purchasing men out of these four sources indicates His purchasing them from the entire earth. The apostle John, who wrote Revelation, was Jewish, but He confirms that Christ died on the cross to redeem men not just from the Jews but from different tribes, tongues, peoples, and nations. God&rsquo;s chosen people are not only from one race. All the different races and people with all different ranks have been put into the Spirit so that they all may be one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). Now in the Spirit as the source, element, essence, and sphere of love, we can love all the believers from different tribes, tongues, peoples, and nations, whom the Lord redeemed through His death (Col. 1:4, 8).</p>
<p>Christ made men out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation a kingdom and priests to God by perfecting them to be priestly kings&mdash;kings to reign on the earth and priests to serve God. The kingdom is for kingship, for the exercising of God&rsquo;s authority, and the priests are for the priesthood, for the accomplishing of the divine ministry.</p>
<p>The priesthood is for the expression of God. The priests enjoy the Lord, and they become His expression, manifestation, habitation, and dwelling place. On the one hand, God fully gains His image and expression through the priesthood. The kingship, on the other hand, is for authority and dominion. The kings represent God to deal with His enemy.</p>
<p>The priesthood and kingship are related to the two items of the original intention of God. There are two main aspects in the creation of man: image and authority, or dominion (Gen. 1:26). Image refers to the expression of God, and dominion is for the representation of God to deal with His enemy. These two aspects were in God&rsquo;s original intention. From the beginning God intended to have His expression and His representation. He created man with His image that man may be His expression, and He committed His authority to man that man may be His representative. From the beginning to the end of the Bible there are these two lines, the line of image and expression and the line of dominion and representation.</p>
<p>We all are born again as priests. Therefore, we need to learn how to enjoy our birthright. We must learn how to live as priests enjoying Christ, contacting Him, feeding on Him, living by Him, putting Him on as our clothing, and taking Him as our dwelling place. When we enjoy Christ in such a way, we will have the priestly function of always ministering Christ both to God and to man. Then our church life will be very healthy and normal, and spontaneously out of this situation the authority of God will be realized. It is by the priesthood that we have the kingship. In the proper church life, God is expressed and His authority is exercised. This is the priesthood plus the kingship.</p>
<p>We need to see that, in order to make us priests, the Lord Jesus purchased us for God by His blood. As those purchased for God by the blood of Christ, we are now priests of God. The redeemed ones are all priests of God. According to the New Testament, the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is to make all those who believe in Christ priests of God. Therefore, if a person is saved but fails to become a priest to serve God, he cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose or satisfy His desire.</p>
<p>A priest in the New Testament is a priest of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). The Old Testament priests were mainly confined to the house of Aaron, that is, to Aaron and his sons. But the New Testament priests are not confined to a family. Rather, the New Testament priesthood is borne by all the believers. First Peter 2 tells us that the believers &ldquo;are a chosen race, a royal priesthood&rdquo; (v. 9). Since the priests form a priesthood, it is no longer the responsibility of a few people. Rather, every believer is included in this responsibility. The number of the New Testament believers far exceeds the number of Israelites in the Old Testament. The number of the Old Testament priests was further restricted to males only. In the New Testament all saved persons, whether male or female, young or old, are priests. Because there are a great number of them, they become a priesthood.</p>
<p>What these priests do in their priesthood is to offer up sacrifices to God (v. 5). In the Old Testament there were mainly five kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering (Lev. 1:1&mdash;6:7). In the New Testament, according to Hebrews 13, the sacrifices offered by the New Testament believers include the sacrifice of praise, the sacrifice of good works, and the sacrifice of material giving. These sacrifices are well pleasing to God. To offer sacrifices to God in the New Testament sense is to offer up the Christ whom we enjoy in many aspects by bringing them to the meetings as offerings to God. In other words, the sacrifices, which are presented to God by the New Testament priests, are the Christ that is offered up, that is, the Christ experienced by us and offered up to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. The One Who Was Slain Being Worthy<br />
to Receive the Power, Riches, Wisdom, Strength,<br />
Honor, Glory, and Blessing</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 5:12, Christ is the Lamb who is worthy to receive the power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing. When the Lord Jesus took the scroll and was about to open its seals, two hosts in the universe worshipped and praised Him. The first host is the angels represented by the twenty-four elders who take the lead to worship Him. The rest of the creation is represented by the four living creatures who also take the lead to worship (vv. 7-8). The praise from the twenty-four elders contains the seven items of power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing, while the praise from the four living creatures includes blessing, honor, glory, and might (vv. 12-13). This scene in the heavens reveals the One who is worthy to open the scroll and its seals, who is the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 5, Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the conquering Lion, is not only worshipped in the heavens but also enthroned and crowned with authority (v. 12). This corresponds to Genesis 49:10 which says, &ldquo;The scepter will not depart from Judah.&rdquo; The scepter signifies royal authority. He is the King of kings! After His ascension, Christ is worshipped as the conquering Lion and has been enthroned with royal authority as the King of kings. This is the position He holds today.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">5. Another Angel</h2>
<p>Revelation 7:2-3 reveals Christ as another Angel. Christ is called &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; because He stands in the position of one who has been sent by God. As the unique, special Angel, Christ is the One sent by God to carry out His economy.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the entire Bible, Christ was sent by the Triune God. This is unveiled in Exodus 3, where Moses, when he was called by God in the wilderness of Sinai, saw the Angel of Jehovah and heard His voice (vv. 1-4). Here the title <em>the Angel of Jehovah</em> refers mainly to Christ, the Son of God, as the One sent by God (cf. John 8:42) to save His people from their situation of suffering (cf. Judg. 6:12-22; 13:3-22). According to verses 2 and 6 of Exodus 3, the Angel of Jehovah, the sent One, was Jehovah Himself, the sending One (cf. Zech. 2:6-11), and Jehovah is the Triune God (Exo. 3:6, 15). This is confirmed by the words of Jehovah to Moses in Exodus 3:6: &ldquo;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; Here Jehovah is revealed as the God of three generations&mdash;the God of the father, his son, and his grandson. That God is the God of three persons implies that He is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). For the purpose of calling and sending Moses, God, the sending One, appeared to him as the sent One (cf. John 20:21).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament Christ was called &ldquo;the Angel of Jehovah,&rdquo; who is God Himself (Gen. 22:11-12; Zech. 1:11-12; 3:1-7). In Genesis the Angel of Jehovah spoke to Abraham. In Revelation He is again called the Angel (10:5, 9), and in 7:2 Christ is specifically revealed as another Angel. There are many angels in the air who serve God&rsquo;s purpose, but above them is another Angel, the unique Angel.</p>
<p>In Revelation Christ is referred to as another Angel four times (7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1). Revelation indicates that as another Angel Christ cares for God&rsquo;s chosen people (the Israelites), executes the prayer of the saints concerning God&rsquo;s economy, possesses the earth in the future, and appears in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God (7:2-8; 8:3-5; 10:1-5; 18:1; 11:15).</p>
<p>Revelation 7:2-8 indicates that this Angel takes care of God&rsquo;s chosen people, Israel. Israel has been and still is under persecution. The entire world has been trying to diminish Israel, so Israel needs special care in order to be preserved. The little nation of Israel is surrounded by many Arab countries, yet it still survives. This is because another Angel is taking care of Israel.</p>
<p>While Christ is in the heavens carrying out God&rsquo;s economy, which is mainly concerned with God&rsquo;s judgment of the earth, He takes care of God&rsquo;s people (vv. 1-3; 8:3-5). This is fully revealed in Revelation 7 and 8. God has two peoples&mdash;the children of Israel and the church composed of redeemed saints. No matter how much this earth is judged by Christ in God&rsquo;s administration, He will take care of the chosen Israel and the redeemed church. We all are under Christ&rsquo;s care in His administration. It does not matter what the other nations say or do, for the nation of Israel is under the care of Christ&rsquo;s universal administration. The other countries may try to do certain things, but any attempt to frustrate Christ&rsquo;s care will be in vain because of the watchful concern of the universal Administrator.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Ascending from the Rising of the Sun</h2>
<p>Revelation 7:2 speaks of Christ as &ldquo;another Angel ascending from the rising of the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Having the Seal of the Living God</h2>
<p>Verse 2 goes on to say that Christ as another Angel has &ldquo;the seal of the living God.&rdquo; In verses 4 through 8 we see that God will seal one hundred forty-four thousand &ldquo;out of every tribe of the sons of Israel,&rdquo; sealing twelve thousand out of each of the twelve tribes. These are the Israelites who will keep the commandments of God during the great tribulation (12:17; 14:12). Altogether, one hundred forty-four thousand faithful Israelites will be sealed on their foreheads. This seal will be a mark recognizable to the angels sent to judge the earth. This is God&rsquo;s way of preserving His chosen Israelites while He is executing His judgment upon the earth.</p>
<p>In His work as another Angel, Christ not only takes care of Israel but also cares for the redeemed saints of the church. This is seen in Revelation 7:9-17, where we have a vision of the preservation of the redeemed ones throughout all the tribulations. The Lord&rsquo;s way to preserve the remnant of Israel is to seal them and leave them on earth. His way to preserve the redeemed saints is to take them away by means of rapture. Eventually, all the redeemed saints will be raptured from earth to heaven.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Crying with a Loud Voice<br />
to the Four Angels to Whom Authority Was Given<br />
to Harm the Earth and the Sea</h2>
<p>Verse 2 also tells us that Christ as another Angel cries &ldquo;with a loud voice to the four angels to whom authority was given to harm the earth and the sea.&rdquo; He orders the angels who were going to damage the earth to wait until those of Israel are sealed.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Saying, Do Not Harm the Earth<br />
or the Sea or the Trees until We Seal the Slaves<br />
of Our God upon Their Foreheads</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Christ says, &ldquo;Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads.&rdquo; According to Revelation 8, the first trumpet is to harm the earth and the trees (v. 7), the second trumpet is to harm the sea (vv. 8-9), the third trumpet is to harm the rivers (vv. 10-11), and the fourth trumpet is to harm the heavenly hosts (v. 12). Before the executing of the first four trumpets, God will seal His chosen Israelites to preserve them from the supernatural calamities which will be carried out by these trumpets. The first four trumpets will harm only the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavenly hosts. It is the fifth trumpet that will torment men directly. God&rsquo;s sealing of His chosen Israelites is especially to preserve them from the torment of the fifth trumpet (9:4).</p>
<p>According to prophecy and their present situation, the children of Israel have returned to the land of their fathers in unbelief. They still cling to their old religion, and they do not believe in God according to His New Testament economy. They are actually in rebellion against Him. When the Lord Jesus came, God changed the dispensation from that of keeping the law to that of believing in the Lord Jesus. But the Jews would not accept this change, and they refused to turn from keeping the law to believing in the Lord Jesus. This was their rebellion, stubbornness, and disobedience. God has borne with them for centuries, and even while, according to His sovereignty, they have returned and been restored as a nation again, they are still in unbelief. They do not believe in the Lord Jesus. The prophecies regarding Israel indicate that they will remain in unbelief until the last day. God, however, is sovereign, and He will always take care of the nation of Israel, not for their sake but for His economy. He knows that among the unbelieving Jews there are some faithful ones, and before He will judge the earth with supernatural calamities, He will seal them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Our Shepherd</h2>
<p>Revelation 7:17 unveils that for our experience and enjoyment Christ is also our Shepherd.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Lamb in the Midst of the Throne Shepherding Us</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them.&rdquo; In this verse the term <em>them</em> refers to all of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, including both those in the Old Testament age and the New Testament age. All the redeemed ones are considered God&rsquo;s flock, of which Christ is the Shepherd.</p>
<p>In Revelation 7:17 we see that the Lamb will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life. Shepherding includes feeding. Under the shepherding of Christ, we &ldquo;will lack nothing&rdquo; (Psa. 23:1). The believers throughout the generations have been under the shepherding of the Lord as the good Shepherd (1 Pet. 2:25). As the Chief Shepherd (5:4) and the great Shepherd of God&rsquo;s flock (Heb. 13:20), He will shepherd us for eternity as the Lamb of God and guide us to springs of waters of life so that we may have eternal satisfaction, without thirst or hunger (Rev. 7:16-17). By shepherding the flock of God, Christ accomplishes a great part of God&rsquo;s organic salvation, His salvation in life (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. And Guiding Us to Springs of Waters of Life</h2>
<p>In His shepherding the flock of God, the main thing Christ does is to guide us to the many different springs of waters of life. In Revelation 7:17 <em>springs of waters of life</em> refers to the unique water of life in different aspects. In keeping with this, John 7:38 speaks of the many rivers of living water flowing out of a believer&rsquo;s innermost being, whereas Revelation 22:1 speaks of the one river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem. This indicates that there will be the unique river of water of life that issues into many rivers for our enjoyment. The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. Rom. 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23), originating from the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God&rsquo;s Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). In eternity we will drink of many springs and enjoy many different waters. How good this is!</p>
<p>To the world and to the Jews Christ is the Ruler of the kings, but to a great multitude of redeemed saints mentioned in Revelation 7:9-17, the Lamb is the Shepherd. Verse 14, which says, &ldquo;These are those who come out of the great tribulation,&rdquo; refers to tribulations, sufferings, persecutions, and afflictions experienced by God&rsquo;s redeemed people throughout the ages. They have in their hands palm branches, which signify the victory of the saints over tribulation, which they have undergone for the Lord&rsquo;s sake (vv. 9-14; cf. John 12:13). Palm trees are also a sign of satisfaction gained through being watered (Exo. 15:27). When He shepherds and guides them to springs of waters of life, He brings them to God Himself. These dear ones, who love God and seek Christ at any cost, gain the supply of living water, which is God Himself. This living water sustains them and enables them to overcome every obstacle.</p>
<p>Many believers have been sustained by the Lord to overcome all obstacles and to come to the springs of the waters of life. They can testify that in their background in religion there was no living water to refresh them. In religion there is only dryness. Some of the believers who were brought up in Judaism surely can confirm that they found only a desert with no supply of living water in the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>We need to praise the Lord for bringing us to the church, where there is a fountain which is God Himself, the source of living water. This living water flows unceasingly so that it fills us to the point of overflowing. It is when we are full of this thirst-quenching water that we can easily overcome whatever comes across our path. By the living water out of this spring, we can overcome all things.</p>
<p>The Lamb, who today is in the heavens, is the One who is shepherding us. He exercises His rulership over the universe, the nations, and the Jews. Yet He also leads His seekers to God as the springs of waters of life. The following chorus from one of our hymns speaks of our enjoyment of the springs of waters of life:</p>
<p class="hbody">Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,<br />
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding joy and pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In abounding measure,<br />
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.</p>
<p class="hbody"><em>Hymns,</em> #322</p>
<p>In the church we find a never ending, sure supply. In this drink we find joy and pleasure in abounding measure. By His heavenly ministry, the Lamb has brought us to a wonderful fountain.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">7. Another Angel</h2>
<p>In Revelation 8:3-5 Christ is presented as another Angel to execute God&rsquo;s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints. Here Christ is revealed as another Angel who presents the prayers of the church to God and carries out the answers to these prayers. The church&rsquo;s function is mainly to pray, call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and cry out to the throne; Christ as another Angel offers all of the church&rsquo;s prayers to God and brings down the answer to these prayers. His way to bring down the answer is to scatter the answer upon the earth. Christ offers the saints&rsquo; prayers to God, adds Himself as the incense to the prayers, receives the answer from God, and pours the answer out upon the earth. This is Christ&rsquo;s bringing God&rsquo;s answer back to earth. When He pours out God&rsquo;s answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers, the earth comes under God&rsquo;s judgment. Today the entire earth is under the answers of the saints&rsquo; prayers. In the administration of God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing in the position of One who has been sent by God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Coming and Standing at the Altar,<br />
Having a Golden Censer, and Much Incense<br />
Being Given to Him That He Should Add It<br />
to the Prayers of All the Saints upon the Golden Altar Which Was before the Throne</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:3 says, &ldquo;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.&rdquo; There were two altars in the tabernacle: the bronze altar, which is the altar of burnt offering in the outer court, and the golden altar, which is the altar of incense in the Holy Place. The first altar in Revelation 8:3 refers to the altar of burnt offering (cf. Exo. 27:1-8), and the golden altar before the throne refers to the incense altar (cf. 30:1-9). Here Christ is serving and working as another Angel to take incense from the golden incense altar and to add that incense to the prayers of the saints. The golden censer signifies the prayers of the saints, which are brought to God by Christ as another Angel. Incense signifies Christ Himself with all His merit to be added to the prayers of the saints that the saints&rsquo; prayers offered upon the golden altar might be acceptable to God. This indicates that our prayers must be accompanied by Christ as incense. In themselves our prayers contain no incense; therefore, Christ as incense must be added to our prayers. Christ is the incense by which our prayers can be accepted, heard, and fulfilled.</p>
<p>This corresponds to Revelation 5:8, which says, &ldquo;When He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.&rdquo; The bowls are the prayers of the saints, and within the bowls is the incense. Our prayers are the containers, the golden bowls, to be filled with incense. This means that something as the incense, so sweet to God, is in the prayers of the saints. The prayers of the saints are the containers, and the incense is the content. Our prayers are the bowls, and the incense is the content. Many times we have merely the bowls with no content; we have only the prayers without the incense. We need to offer prayers to which the Lord can add Himself as incense.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Altar of Burnt Offering and the Altar of Incense</h2>
<p>In Revelation 8 we see Christ as the Priest burning the incense with the fire from the altar of burnt offering (vv. 3-5). Christ came and stood at the altar of burnt offering (cf. Exo. 27:1-8) to get the fire. Then He burned the incense and offered it at the incense altar. These two altars are consummations. We must see that these are not the altars in type but the real altars. The incense altar is in the heavenly tabernacle. But the altar of burnt offering surely cannot be in the heavens; instead, it must be something on this earth. Also, Christ stands by this altar. The earthly altar is a sign of the cross. The cross was not something accomplished in the heavens but on earth. Therefore, Christ standing by the altar of the burnt offering indicates that Christ stands by His cross to get the fire from the cross to burn the incense to offer to God on the incense altar in the heavens.</p>
<p>Of the two altars in the tabernacle, one is outside the tabernacle, and the other is inside the tabernacle. The burnt offering altar is for the incense altar. We can prove this in two ways. First, in the Old Testament the fire used to burn the incense came from the altar of burnt offering. The only fire that could be used to burn the incense was the fire from the altar of burnt offering, the heavenly fire that came from God (Lev. 9:24). Any other kind of fire would have been &ldquo;strange fire,&rdquo; like that which the two sons of Aaron offered (10:1). This means that we need to pray based on the redemption of the cross. Redemption at the burnt offering altar is for fellowship at the incense altar. At the altar of burnt offering there is the cleansing of the blood for fellowship. First John 1:7 tells us that in order to maintain the fellowship, we need the cleansing of the blood. Without the altar of burnt offering we do not have the ground to burn the incense, that is, to fellowship with God. Redemption is for fellowship; it brings us back into the fellowship with God. Second, the blood shed upon the offering altar is brought into the Holy Place to be sprinkled upon the four corners of the incense altar (Lev. 4:7a). This again proves that the altar outside the tabernacle is for the one inside the Holy Place.</p>
<p>This indicates that what connects the altar in the outer court and the altar in the tabernacle is the redeeming blood and the burning fire. First, the blood shed on the outer altar had to be brought into the tabernacle to be put on the inner altar. This means that before we spend time in the presence of God to burn the incense, we must always apply the blood. We can never burn the incense without the blood. We must always apply the blood in our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Second, the fire which came down from heaven to burn the offerings on the altar in the outer court had to be the fire that burned the incense on the altar in the tabernacle. Both Exodus and Leviticus show us that no one could enter into the tabernacle to burn incense before God and draw near to God except by passing through the altar of burnt offering. The altar is the cross. This means that without passing through the cross, no one can be before God and have prayer which is a fragrant incense that is acceptable to God.</p>
<p>This implies that we can never spend time in the presence of God if we come with strange fire. Strange fire is our natural emotion, our natural enthusiasm, our natural energy, or our natural effort in prayer. We must never be on fire with anything natural; instead, we must be burned by the heavenly fire. We must be on fire and fervent in our spirit but not by anything natural (Rom. 12:11). Our natural effort and energy must be consumed by the heavenly fire. We must be in our spirit by the burning of the heavenly fire, not by our emotions or our enthusiasm. All that is natural must be burned away so that only the heavenly fire remains.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may sense that we are so much on fire for the Lord, but if we check ourselves, we see that we are not burning with heavenly fire but with strange fire. We may have enthusiasm, but it is not heavenly; rather, it is natural. We are fervent within, but we are fervent naturally, not spiritually. We are fervent in an earthly way, not in a heavenly way. The more we are fervent naturally, the more we are dead in the spirit. Natural fervency brings in spiritual death. However, the more we are fervent with the heavenly fire, the more we are living in our spirit.</p>
<p>The burning fire indicates that whatever we are needs to be reduced to ashes. We need to be burned so that we become ashes. Whatever we pray at the golden altar of incense will be an intercession. At the incense altar we do not pray much for ourselves. Instead, we pray for God&rsquo;s economy, His dispensing, His move, His recovery, the churches, and the saints. We intercede in this way spontaneously.</p>
<p>When we pray at the incense altar, it is very difficult to be occupied with ourselves. The reason self is not involved with the prayers offered at the incense altar is that in order to pray at this altar, we must first become ashes; that is, we must become nothing. To intercede at the second altar requires that we first be reduced to nothing. If we have become ashes, we will not have our natural conduct, our natural sight, or our natural virtue. We will not have natural conduct replacing Christ as our life supply, we will not have natural sight replacing Christ as our light, and we will not have natural virtues replacing Christ as our incense. This means that we will no longer be natural. Therefore, with us there will be no veil. In place of the veil, we will have the Ark, Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony. As a result, we will be qualified to intercede at the incense altar. When we come to this altar, our unique taste, our only interest, is to pray.</p>
<p>From the altar of burnt offering a sweet savor ascended to God. A sweet savor also ascended to Him from the incense altar. Hence, from both the burning on the altar of burnt offering and from the burning on the incense altar a sweet savor ascended to God for His satisfaction. There was a difference, however, between these two kinds of burnings. The burning on the burnt offering altar was a burning of judgment, but the burning on the incense altar was a burning of acceptance.</p>
<p>The burning at the outer altar and the ascending at the second altar reflect each other. In particular, the first kind of sweet savor, that from the altar of burnt offering, is reflected in the second, that from the incense altar. The sweet savor that ascended to God from the altar of burnt offering is reflected in the savor that ascended to Him from the incense altar. Here, in these two kinds of sweet savor, we have the sweetness of Christ in His death at the burnt offering altar and the sweetness of Christ in His resurrection and ascension at the incense altar. The fragrance of Christ in His resurrection and ascension is for our acceptance.</p>
<p>At the outer altar Christ, as the reality of all the offerings, satisfies all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. As such, Christ also satisfies the hunger of the priests. The offerings satisfy both God and the priests. Then the satisfied priests go into the tabernacle with the blood to offer the incense. At the inner altar the incense offered is Christ mingled with the priests. This incense, spiritually speaking, is the prayer from within us as the sweetness of Christ. Our prayer must be the expression of the sweetness of Christ. It must be Christ uttered and expressed in a fine and sweet way.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Golden Altar Being before the Throne</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation the incense altar is directly in front of the throne of God&rsquo;s authority. According to Revelation 8, Christ as another Angel comes and adds His incense to the prayers of the saints. This incense then ascends to God at the throne of administration, and God answers the saints&rsquo; prayers. As a result, fire comes down to earth to execute the divine judgments recorded in the remainder of the book of Revelation. This is a picture of the incense altar being the administrating throne of God for Him to execute His judgments in His administration. It is important for us to see that the execution of God&rsquo;s administration is motivated by the prayers offered to Him from the incense altar.</p>
<p>On the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies there was a lid, a cover, called the propitiatory cover. That cover, made of gold, was the place where God met with His people. The King James Version describes this lid, this cover, as the mercy seat. Eventually, the mercy seat in the tabernacle in Exodus becomes the throne of grace spoken of in Hebrews 4:16. This means that the throne of grace is the propitiatory cover, the lid covering the Ark of the Testimony. On the one hand, with respect to propitiation, this lid is the propitiatory cover. On the other hand, with respect to God&rsquo;s dispensing, it is the throne of grace, the place where God dispenses His grace to people. Furthermore, according to the book of Revelation, it is also the throne of authority, the throne of divine administration. Therefore, one item is the mercy seat, the throne of grace, and the throne of administration. Revelation 2 and 3 present the church, and chapters 4 and 5 portray the throne of God. The throne in Revelation 4 and 5 is the throne of authority, the throne of the divine administration over the entire universe. Therefore, to the universe as a whole, this is the throne of God&rsquo;s authority, but to us, it is the throne of grace. It is the place, the propitiatory cover, where we may contact God and receive grace.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s interceding life, signified by the incense altar, is the center of the divine practice, the divine administration. In the universe there is something that may be called God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s administration, God&rsquo;s practice. God is not idle; He is a God of purpose. He has a purpose, and He is moving, working, acting, dispensing, and administrating. When we study the incense altar, we are studying the greatest matter in the universe. There is nothing more central than this. We may say that the Ark in the Holy of Holies is the central government, our heavenly Washington, D.C. The incense altar may be regarded as the heavenly White House. This means that everything is executed, motivated, and carried out from this divine center. The intercession of Christ is God&rsquo;s White House. Christ&rsquo;s interceding life, His prayer life, is the center of God&rsquo;s administration (Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34). The incense altar is the center of God&rsquo;s operation in the universe.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a book of God&rsquo;s administration, a book of divine execution. This book reveals the throne of God and the administration of God throughout the universe. However, the executing center actually is not the throne; the executing center is the incense altar in Revelation 8. On this altar the prayers of the saints are offered to God, and Christ&rsquo;s incense is added to these prayers. When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God executes the policies of His administration.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Incense Altar Signifying Christ as Intercessor</h2>
<p>According to Luke 1:8-10, while the priest was burning the incense, the multitude of the people were praying. The burning of incense before God is the prayer of the saints ascending to God. Therefore, to burn the incense really means to pray. However, strictly speaking, the incense altar does not refer to our prayer; rather, it refers to the prayer of Christ, because the altar itself is a type of the person of Christ. The incense altar signifies Christ praying, Christ interceding.</p>
<p>The individual Christ, after His resurrection and especially after His ascension, has become corporate. Thus, today before God, not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body, is interceding as well (1 Cor. 12:12; Acts 12:5, 12). Christ the Head is interceding in the heavens, and the church the Body is interceding on earth. The intercessor, therefore, is not merely Christ Himself but Christ with His Body.</p>
<p>The prayer life of Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s execution of His government on earth. In Revelation 8 we need to see not only the prayers of the saints but also the prayers of Christ. The prayers in Revelation 8 are no longer merely the prayers of the individual Christ but the prayers of the corporate Christ. In the matter of the execution that takes place at the incense altar, the saints truly are one with Christ. Here we see the prayer life of the corporate Christ.</p>
<p>We need to realize that whenever we pray in the spirit, Christ is praying in our praying. The New Testament speaks of praying in the Lord&rsquo;s name (John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:23-24). To pray in the name of the Lord Jesus is to pray in Christ. When we pray in this way, Christ is actually the one praying. He prays in us; He prays in our prayer. In the sight of God, all the proper prayers of the saints and of the churches are prayers of Christ and are included as part of Christ&rsquo;s intercession.</p>
<p>The prayer we offer at the incense altar will be intercessory prayers, not private or personal prayers. Whenever we open our mouth to pray at the incense altar, the prayer that will issue forth will not be personal, individual prayer. It will be intercessory prayer. Here we no longer have any interest in ourselves or in our welfare. Instead of considering ourselves and praying for ourselves, we intercede for others. At that time we will be, in our experience, a real member of Christ, a genuine part of the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ. Furthermore, that will be the time when we cooperate with Christ in His ministry of intercession. He intercedes in a particular way, and we cooperate with Him in His way of interceding. This means that we carry out His intercession in our prayers of intercession. Here we are truly one with the Lord.</p>
<p>We can see this matter in the book of Romans. It is possible to regard the book of Romans as representing the Bible as a whole. In the first few chapters of Romans we have the altar of burnt offering, and in chapter 8 we have the Ark, for this chapter is the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, in chapter 8 we also have the incense altar, Christ as the Intercessor. Verse 34 says, &ldquo;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.&rdquo; According to this verse, the One who died for our sins, who has been raised from the dead, and who has ascended to the right hand of God in the heavens is the One who is interceding for us. Only this One can condemn us, but instead of condemning us, He is interceding for us. This One will never condemn us. Now, after His death, resurrection, and ascension, He is interceding for us.</p>
<p>If it were not for Christ&rsquo;s intercession, no one would accept His death, experience His resurrection, or be one with Him in His ascension. In order for people to be motivated to experience Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, His intercession is necessary. Without the interceding of Christ and the church, sinners will not receive the death of Christ. Moreover, those who have received Christ&rsquo;s death will not go on to experience His resurrection, much less know what it means to be with Christ in ascension, sitting with Him in the heavenlies. All these experiences are dependent on the motivation that comes from the interceding Christ and the interceding church. This is the significance of the incense altar.</p>
<p>The Bible first shows us the altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, and then the laver, which signifies the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Following this, we have Christ in the Holy Place as the life supply, signified by the bread of the Presence; Christ as the light, signified by the lampstand; and Christ in the Holy of Holies as the embodiment of God, signified by the Ark. Finally, in the book of Revelation, a book of God&rsquo;s executing, we see that the divine administration, the divine executing, is always carried out by the incense altar.</p>
<p>If we consider the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we will see that the incense altar is the center. If there were no incense altar in the tabernacle, the tabernacle would not have a center. The executing center of God&rsquo;s administration is not the Ark; the executing center is the incense altar. If we do not have the center, the incense altar, none of the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court will be effective in our experience. We must have the prayer life, signified by the incense altar. The prayer life motivates us to experience the altar, the laver, the table, the lampstand, and the Ark. If we pray even a little, we will find, in our experience, that the table of the bread of the Presence is precious, that the lampstand is prevailing, and that the Ark is attractive.</p>
<p>In our experience we need to come to the altar, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the Ark. After we come to the Ark in the Holy of Holies, we need to come back to the incense altar. The incense altar is not simply one of the items on the passageway through the tabernacle. On the contrary, it can be compared to a motor which causes everything to operate. Hence, the incense altar stands by itself as a turning point. Again and again we must come back to this turning point. This means that in order to experience any aspect of the outer court or the tabernacle, we need to pray. When we pray, everything works. When we pray, in our experience the altar, the laver, the table, the lampstand, and the Ark are all effective. However, when the motor stops, everything else stops also. When the motor operates, everything else operates. This is the reason that we need to have a motor&mdash;the interceding Christ&mdash;operating within us. We need to have a prayer life, a life of prayer.</p>
<p>The motor in our being is the prayer life. Christ is the incense altar. This means that He is the motivator and even the motor. Therefore, we need to let Him pray in us, allowing Him to guide us into prayer and into the enjoyment of Him as our prayer.</p>
<p>May we all be stirred up to seek such an interceding life so that we may enjoy Christ as the incense altar. This incense altar is the turning point of our Christian life. It motivates every aspect of the Christian life to positive action. The prayer of intercession also motivates others to come to Christ at the altar of burnt offering, at the laver, at the table, at the lampstand, and at the Ark in the Holy of Holies. It will motivate a great many saints to seek the riches of Christ until they come to maturity. Therefore, it is extremely important that we intercede with Christ at the incense altar.</p>
<p>The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people (Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34). We need to participate in Christ&rsquo;s interceding life (vv. 26-27; 1 Tim. 2:1; Eph. 6:18-19; Col. 4:3; 1 Thes. 5:25; 2 Thes. 3:1; Heb. 13:18). If we have a clear view of the incense altar, our prayer life will be revolutionized. Instead of being occupied in prayer with material needs or personal concerns, we will pray for the executing of God&rsquo;s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God&rsquo;s supplying grace (1 Tim. 2:1; Rom. 8:26-27). At the incense altar as the center of the divine administration, we will become intercessors, interceding for others and for the Lord&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Who today is praying that God would dispense His grace into people? Who is praying in such a way as to motivate God&rsquo;s throne of authority to judge this age? Christ has a great deal of incense, but where are the prayers that are qualified to receive the incense of Christ? Is Christ able to add His incense to our prayers? Therefore, it is very important for us to see this concerning our prayer life.</p>
<p>What God desires is the prayer at the incense altar. This kind of prayer is intercessory prayer. Whenever we open our mouths to pray at the incense altar, our prayers will not be for ourselves. Instead, our prayers will be for God&rsquo;s eternal plan, for His recovery, for His move, and for all His churches. Our prayer will indicate where we are and who we are.</p>
<p>As those who are seeking the Lord, we in the recovery, both individually and corporately, must learn one thing&mdash;to pray. We need a praying life. The real praying life is always a life of interceding. Genuine prayer is not mainly to pray for ourselves; it is to pray continually for others. To pray for ourselves is not intercession. To pray for others is to intercede for them. The proper prayer life is a life of praying for others, of interceding for them. We need to pray for the churches throughout the earth and for all the saints. We need to pray for the older ones, the younger ones, and the opposers. We need such an interceding life. The intercession offered at the incense altar should daily be increasing.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands of prayers are offered to God by Christians, but there is very little execution of God&rsquo;s purpose. Christians pray again and again, yet there is very little dispensing of the supplying grace of God. Today we need to learn to pray in such a way as to motivate the throne of grace to dispense God&rsquo;s life supply as grace to all the needy ones. We need to learn how to pray to motivate the throne of authority to execute the divine administration. If we have this view concerning prayer, our prayer life will be revolutionized. May we all see this view and experience such a revolution.</p>
<p>We all need to put these truths into practice. It may help us to pray more if we realize that we do not need to pray in a formal way; we do not need to offer natural, religious prayers. On the contrary, at the incense altar we should become intercessors. All day long we need to intercede for others and for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. As we pray in this way, we know that we are truly one with the Lord. By our prayers of intercession we are one with Him at the incense altar. This kind of prayer is a fragrant incense to God. This prayer fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose, satisfies His hunger, and delights His heart.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(17)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as another Angel in Revelation 8.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Smoke of the Incense Going Up with<br />
the Prayers of the Saints out of His Hand before God</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:4 says, &ldquo;The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God.&rdquo; The smoke of the incense indicates that the incense is burned and ascends to God with the prayers of the saints. This implies that the prayers of the saints become effective and are acceptable to God. In other words, smoke indicates that the saints&rsquo; prayers are effective because Christ has been added to them as incense. The smoke of the incense goes up with the prayers of the saints to the throne of God, and the prayers are answered.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Praying Christ</h2>
<p>It is incense, not the saints&rsquo; prayers, that causes the smoke to rise. In our prayers we need to have Christ as the incense with the smoke that rises. The point here is that to burn the incense actually means to pray Christ. The incense typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ, the unique One who is received by God and acceptable to Him. Thus, He becomes a sweet savor to God. This savor, as the incense, should be in our prayer. Since the incense signifies Christ, to burn the incense means to pray Christ. God&rsquo;s desire is that when we pray, we pray Christ.</p>
<p>If we see that to burn the incense is to pray Christ, we will be ashamed of the way that we have often prayed in the past. We have prayed many things that are not Christ. Instead of burning Christ as the incense, we have burned strange incense, something other than Christ Himself. However, we should not offer as incense anything except Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) The Ointment and the Incense</h2>
<p>In Exodus 30 we first have a picture of the ointment (vv. 22-33); then immediately following is another picture showing us the incense (vv. 34-38). The significance of these two pictures is tremendous. It is that of two-way traffic, the coming and the going; the ointment is coming to us, and the incense is going to God. Christ as the Spirit coming to us is the ointment; Christ ascending from us to God is the incense. The ointment is toward us; the incense is toward God. The ointment is for us to enjoy, and the incense is for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. Incense is absolutely and entirely for God. But there is an enjoyment for us&mdash;the ointment. The priests and all the parts of the tabernacle were anointed with the ointment. This is our portion. The incense is God&rsquo;s portion. The ointment is Christ for us; the incense is Christ for God. We should have a two-way traffic in which Christ comes to us as the ointment, and He also goes back to God as the incense. After experiencing Christ as the ointment, we must &ldquo;complete the circuit&rdquo; by burning the incense. We need the anointing of the ointment, and we need the burning of the incense as well. God anoints us with the ointment, and we burn the incense to God. In short, the ointment brings God to us in Christ and through Christ for our participation in the divine element; the incense is our going to God with Christ and as Christ in prayer for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. This kind of prayer simultaneously satisfies God with a sweet fragrance and carries out God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Smoke of the Incense Going Up<br />
with the Saints&rsquo; Prayers<br />
That Are in Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>Revelation 8 clearly shows us two things: the prayers of the saints and Christ as another Angel bringing much incense. The incense refers to the resurrected Christ. This incense is added to the prayers of the saints. Here we need to ask whether the Lord Jesus can simply add the incense to all our prayers. The answer is no. If we wish to have the Lord Jesus in resurrection added to our prayer, our prayer surely must pass through the redemption of the blood and the termination of the cross. The prayers in Revelation 8 are prayers of death and resurrection; hence, once the incense of those prayers is presented before God, immediately thunders and lightnings are poured down on earth. This means that God both hears and answers the saints&rsquo; prayers that are in death and resurrection.</p>
<p>Revelation 8 also shows us how God in His administration will judge this age. This judgment is waiting for the prayers of those who have received both the redemption of the blood and the termination by the cross. It is waiting for the prayers of those who have been resurrected to seek after His heart and stand on the position of death, thus allowing the resurrected Christ to be joined with their prayers. They will be tremendous prayers that can judge and end this age. The reason that the saints are able to pray for such high and great things is that they have been terminated at the cross and are able to allow the resurrected Christ to be added to their prayers. This is the meaning of the incense being added to the prayers.</p>
<p>True prayers are Christ in us praying to the Christ in heaven. Since we are men of many opinions, how can Christ find a way to come out of our prayers? To allow Him the way, we need to pass through the cleansing of the blood and the termination of the fire. Terminated ones have no opinions. After we receive redemption and termination at the cross, we can be united with Christ in our prayer. Consequently, our prayer is Christ. When Christ expresses Himself through us, that is the incense being added to our prayers.</p>
<p>The incense refers to the resurrected Christ with His merits&mdash;all that He is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He does. The resurrected Christ with all His work and fruits is the incense. As long as we receive the redemption of the blood and are in the termination of the cross, Christ is joined with us. Then when we pray, it is Christ who prays. At such a time our prayer is the expression of Christ. As a result, before God these prayers are the incense that is acceptable to God and will be answered by Him.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous message, in order to pray at the altar of incense, we must first experience the altar of burnt offering. In our experience of the altar of burnt offering, we need to have a full realization concerning the blood and the ashes. Although there are numerous aspects of the cross, with relation to prayer there are mainly two aspects. One aspect is signified by the blood shed on the altar, and the other is signified by the fire burning on the altar. When anyone offers a sacrifice at the altar of the burnt offering, and it is accepted by God and consumed by fire, there are only two things in front of him. These two things are the blood round about the altar and the coals upon the altar. As the ashes and the coals of fire are mixed together, eventually, what the offerer sees is just the blood and the fire.</p>
<p>The blood and the fire are the two important aspects of the cross in relation to prayer. The ability of a priest to enter the Holy Place to burn incense and pray before God is based on two things. First, he has brought with him the blood from the burnt offering altar outside and put it on the incense altar. Second, he has brought with him the fire, which consumed the sacrifice offered on the burnt offering altar outside, and has put the fire on the incense altar to burn the incense. The blood on the incense altar inside and the blood on the burnt offering altar outside are one and the same. The coals of fire on the incense altar and the coals of fire on the burnt offering altar are also one and the same. In other words, the blood on the incense altar inside is based on the blood on the burnt offering altar outside. The fire on the incense altar inside is based on the fire on the burnt offering altar outside. The blood is for redemption; the fire is for termination. Anything that is put into the fire will be terminated. The most serious damage done to anything is caused by fire. Whenever something passes through fire, it is consumed. On the cross the Lord shed His blood for redemption. Through His death He also brought in a great termination. Every sacrifice that is placed on the altar of the burnt offering not only sheds blood but also becomes ashes. The cross results in both redemption and termination.</p>
<p>If a person has not been sprinkled by the blood, before God he is just like Cain, who could neither be accepted by God nor pray. Everyone who is acceptable to God and able to pray has been sprinkled with the blood. But a person who goes before God to pray not only needs the redemption of the blood; he also needs to be one who has been consumed at the cross. Nadab and Abihu fell dead before God due to a problem concerning the fire, not concerning the blood (Lev. 10:1-2). Spiritually speaking, Nadab and Abihu went before God to pray according to their natural man, without having been consumed and terminated by the cross. Consequently, not only were their prayers not accepted by God, but even they themselves were struck dead by God. Hence, everyone who learns to pray must not only be redeemed by the blood but also be terminated and become ashes. Our natural life needs to be completely terminated by the cross.</p>
<p>Without the blood and the fire, no one could enter into the presence of God. Without the redemption and the termination of the cross, no one can have access to God. A man may be able to pray a great deal before God, but he should not be overconfident that all his prayers are acceptable to God. A person who knows how to pray is always one who has been both redeemed under the blood and terminated on the cross. When we go before God to pray, we first need to ask whether we have been terminated. Suppose we wish to pray concerning the gospel, our family, the giving of material things, or the matter of marriage. In each case we need to ask if we have been terminated in that particular matter. We must ask whether we are praying with any self-interest. Whatever we pray for, we need to have a termination in that matter.</p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that the fire that burns on the burnt offering altar is the same fire that burns incense on the incense altar. Only the fire that burns the sacrifice into ashes can be the fire that burns the incense. If the fire is brought to the incense altar to burn the incense without having burned the sacrifice into ashes, then that fire is called strange fire. If we have not been terminated in a certain matter yet bring that matter into the presence of God in prayer, it is a great offense to God.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, if a person has not been terminated by the cross in a certain matter, it is not possible for him to truly pray for that matter. If we have not been terminated by the cross concerning a certain person, then we are not qualified to pray for him. Many times the Lord does not hear our prayers for our own families because we have not become ashes. Those prayers are merely natural prayers, prayers of strange fire. Many times when we pray for the church of God and for the work of the Lord, the Lord does not answer. We pray for the Lord&rsquo;s blessings, yet we do not see the blessings. We pray for years, asking the Lord to make the church grow, but the church still may not have growth. Many of our prayers have not been answered, because they are prayers of strange fire, natural prayers.</p>
<p>It is erroneous to believe that God will surely hear our prayers because He is merciful and gracious to us. God often does not hear our prayers, because we, the praying ones, have not passed through the altar. Some bring with them only the blood of the altar but not the fire; they pass through the redemption but not through the termination of the altar. We need to remember that whenever man goes to burn incense at the incense altar, he must fulfill two basic conditions. First, he must experience the blood; that is, he must be redeemed and cleansed. Second, he must experience the fire; that is, he must be consumed and become ashes.</p>
<p>When the light of the Lord shines on us strongly, we will not be able to pray for a great number of things. The decrease in the number of our prayers may prove that we are being purified. If we recognize that many prayers are prayers of strange fire, we will see that those prayers are neither necessary nor right. We will not dare to pray those prayers which are for ourselves and not for God&rsquo;s sake, because they are initiated by us, not by God. After we have been terminated by the cross, there is a great purification of our prayer.</p>
<p>Ashes mean that everything has been terminated, yet the fire that burns the ashes is still there to burn the incense before God. The incense refers to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and the fragrance of the Lord in His resurrection. Where the Lord is, there is resurrection. Wherever we have been terminated, there is the manifestation of Christ. We first pass through the redemption of the cross before God, accept the termination of the cross, and truly become ashes before God. Then, immediately, Christ becomes the incense which we burn before God.</p>
<p>Genuine prayer is both Christ Himself and the expression of Christ. A prayer that is good, right, proper, true, and acceptable to God is the expression of Christ. If we are terminated on the cross, Christ will live out of such a termination. Christ then will be lived out in our prayer. Only such a prayer can be acceptable before God and be considered a prayer of sweet-smelling savor. This is a prayer of one who has passed through the cleansing of the blood and the termination of the fire, thus allowing Christ to come forth from within.</p>
<p>If we truly have a vision of this, we will prostrate ourselves before God, confessing our filthiness and naturalness. Initially we will not be able to utter any other prayer. We will see the need to be cleansed by the blood and consumed by the fire. We will say to God, &ldquo;I am an unclean person, and I am also a natural man. To this day I am still in my natural self. I need Your blood to cleanse me and Your fire to consume me. I need the cross to redeem and also to terminate me.&rdquo; When we thus allow the cross to terminate us, in a practical way we can experience Christ&rsquo;s coming forth from us. It is this resurrected Christ who becomes our prayer, the incense which we burn before God. We may not pray many prayers, but those that we do pray will be answered by God.</p>
<p>We need to see the necessity for prayer to be in resurrection. In spiritual experience the outer court of the tabernacle denotes the earth, the earthly aspect, whereas the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, the heavenly aspect. Whatever is heavenly is in resurrection. The table of the bread of the Presence signifies that the Lord is our bread of life. This is of the heavenly aspect and is therefore in resurrection. The golden lampstand indicates that the Lord is our light of life. This is also of the heavenly aspect and in resurrection. Man&rsquo;s prayer before God, signified by the incense altar, should be entirely in resurrection. Man may go before God to burn incense, that is, to utter prayers before God by drawing near to God and contacting God. Such prayer must be absolutely in resurrection.</p>
<p>Among the spices that are burnt on the incense altar, the principal one is frankincense (Exo. 30:34). In the Bible frankincense specifically signifies resurrection, just as myrrh denotes death. The frankincense which is burnt on the incense altar is a symbol of resurrection. When the sweet-smelling savor ascends, there is altogether an atmosphere in resurrection. Hence, according to the type in the Old Testament, man&rsquo;s going before God to burn incense is entirely a matter in resurrection. This indicates that man&rsquo;s prayers before God must be in resurrection. Although we who pray are human beings, every prayer needs to be in resurrection. Furthermore, although we are praying on earth today, every prayer must be in the position of ascension. For our prayer to be acceptable to God and be considered by God as a sweet-smelling savor, it must be in resurrection and ascension.</p><h2 class="head5">4) Three Priestly Steps of Prayer</h2>
<p>Today, if we would be genuine priests, we must burn the incense. A priest is a person who burns the incense inwardly to contact the Lord. Priests are a people of incense. The work of the priests is not mainly to make offerings but to burn the incense. Day by day they burn the incense, which is to pray. We need to learn how to burn the incense in a fine way to offer a sweet savor to God.</p>
<p>The proper way to pray is to apply Christ as all the offerings, to feed upon and take in Christ as our full nourishment, and then to utter something of Christ from deep within. These three items are the three stages of real prayer. In our prayer to the Lord, we must first apply Christ as all the offerings. This includes our confessions to God. When we begin to pray, we may have the deep conviction that we are sinful. Immediately, we need to apply Christ as our trespass offering or as our sin offering. We should pray, &ldquo;O Father, I am so sinful, but how I thank You that Christ today is my sin offering and my trespass offering. I simply come to You with Christ as my sin and trespass offerings.&rdquo; If we do not pray in this way, we cannot enter into our spirit, which is the practical Holy of Holies. Many Christians are praying outside the spirit because they do not apply Christ as all the different offerings.</p>
<p>Second, we need to enjoy Christ in the presence of God. Sometimes we may enjoy Christ before God by reading His Word, and we may take Christ in by pray-reading the Word. When we feed on Christ to enjoy Him and take Him in as nourishment, it is by this Christ with His redeeming blood that we can go into the presence of God.</p>
<p>Third, we need to utter and express something of Christ from deep within our spirit, not from our mind. This expression of Christ is the sweet incense ascending to God. It brings us into God and God into us. As a result, we will not only be mingled with Christ but also mingled with God. When we pray in this way, it is not only we who are praying but Christ who is praying within us. We and Christ, Christ and we, become one by praying. Then our prayer to God is the sweet incense ascending to Him. The more we pray by offering the ascending incense in this way, the more the glory of God will come down. The incense goes forth, and the glory comes down. This is the real communication, the real communion, and the real fellowship. Prayer as the incense ascends to God, and the glory, the light of God, shines down into us. Eventually, we will be full of Christ and saturated with the shekinah glory of God.</p>
<p>This kind of prayer needs time. We must spend time in the presence of the Lord to offer the offerings and to burn the incense. It takes much time to burn the incense. What we need is the priesthood with the priestly function, that is, to burn the incense through all the offerings. If we practice this priestly office daily, the entire situation of the church today will be changed. We need to convert our times of discussion into the burning of the incense. We must learn to apply Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to utter something of Christ. This is the proper prayer of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Today the church&rsquo;s urgent need is for all believers to practice the priestly office of burning the incense in the presence of God. The only way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to spend an adequate amount of time&mdash;at least half an hour daily&mdash;to apply Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to express Christ. In this expression of Christ, we will commune and converse with God in order to bring ourselves into God and God into us. Something very sweet ascending to God and something very glorious descending into us will saturate us and make us the genuine priesthood. The recovery of the church life depends on this priestly office.</p>
<p>We should attend this priestly office not only individually but more often corporately. For example, if we come together with some saints every day for half an hour to an hour to apply Christ, enjoy Christ, and express Christ corporately in our prayer to God, this will help the building up of the church very much. We should simply spend time in the presence of God to burn the incense. If we attend to this kind of priestly office individually and corporately, there will be a great change in life and expression among us. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may carry out this commission.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Taking the Censer, Filling It with<br />
the Fire of the Altar, and Casting It to the Earth;<br />
and There Being Thunders, Voices,<br />
Lightnings, and an Earthquake</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:5 continues, &ldquo;The Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.&rdquo; Here the altar in the expression <em>the fire of the altar</em> refers to the altar of burnt offering, from which the fire was taken. In Leviticus 16:12-13 Aaron was instructed to burn the incense with the fire that burned the offerings on the bronze altar in the outer court. The incense was burned with the fire from the altar in the outer court, signifying that Christ&rsquo;s being burned as the incense for our acceptance before God depends on His death on the cross for our sins. Christ first became the offerings to take away our sin; then, in His resurrection, with His death on the cross as the basis, He became the incense for our acceptance. This indicates that our prayers should be based upon Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross, with Himself added as incense in order that they will be effective and thus be heard by God.</p>
<p>Christ took the censer, filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast the fire to the earth. The Lord&rsquo;s casting of the fire became the judgment upon the earth. As a result, there were thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake. This indicates that God&rsquo;s coming judgment on the earth will be the answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers. In Revelation 6:9-11, underneath the altar the souls of the martyred saints prayed for vengeance, crying with a loud voice, &ldquo;How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo; In chapter 8 the Lord added Himself as incense to the prayers of the martyred saints, and the prayers went up to the throne of God and were answered. The answer to the prayers was Christ&rsquo;s casting of the fire of the altar to the earth, which fire became God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth.</p><h2 class="head5">1) Casting Fire to the Earth<br />
to Execute God&rsquo;s Judgment upon the Earth</h2>
<p>Thunders, voices, lightings, and an earthquake imply the answer to the prayers of the saints, including the prayer mentioned in Luke 18:7-8. The prayers of the saints in Revelation 8 must be for the judgment of the earth, which opposes God&rsquo;s economy. To cast fire to the earth is to execute God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth. Therefore, the thunders, voices, lightnings, and the earthquake come as signs of God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth is the answer to the prayers of the saints with Christ as the incense. Although the sixth seal has been opened and the seven trumpets are ready to be sounded, nothing happens until Christ comes to offer the saints&rsquo; prayers to God with Himself as the incense. At that time, there are thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake. This indicates that while God has the intention of executing His judgment upon the earth, there is still the need of the saints to cooperate with Him with their prayers. God needs His saints to pray so that He might execute His judgment. If we read Luke 18, we will see that the Lord Jesus says that at a certain time the saints on earth will cry to God to come in to deal with the situation and to vindicate Himself. At the end of this age, people will be so rebellious against God that some will even declare to the whole universe that they are God. While God has been tolerating this, some of the faithful saints will no longer bear it and will pray, &ldquo;O sovereign Lord, how long will You bear with this? Will You tolerate this rebellion forever? How long will it be before You come in to vindicate Yourself and avenge us? How long will it be until all the earth will know that You are the Lord?&rdquo; Eventually, there will be a need for this kind of prayer. The time is coming when we will all be pressed to pray like this. This will indicate that the end is at hand, because our spirit will not tolerate the situation any longer. Then we will pray to the Lord to vindicate Himself and to let all the rebellious ones know that He is God. When we pray like this, the Angel sent by God will minister to God with our prayer, adding to it Himself as the incense. God will certainly answer this prayer, and there will be thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake. That will be the beginning of God&rsquo;s judgment upon this rebellious earth. This will take place at the opening of the seventh seal when Christ, another Angel, will minister as our High Priest to bring our prayers mingled with His incense to God and will be the One sent to execute God&rsquo;s judgment on earth.</p>
<p>Revelation 8:6 says, &ldquo;The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to trumpet.&rdquo; The seven trumpets were given to the seven angels (v. 2). But it is after the prayers of the saints in verses 3 through 5 have been answered that the seven angels are prepared to trumpet. The answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers is the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth by the seven trumpets that followed. In other words, the seven trumpets are the answer to those prayers. God&rsquo;s will in heaven requires the saints&rsquo; prayers to carry it out on earth. The offering of the saints&rsquo; prayers to God by Christ brings in the seven trumpets.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Administrating the Universe through Our Prayers</h2>
<p>In Revelation 8 Christ is depicted as another Angel, offering the prayers of the saints to God (vv. 3-5). For His administration He needs our prayers. Our prayer is the response to His heavenly ministry. As we pray, He administrates. As He administrates, we are praying. He offers these prayers to God, and then He pours out God&rsquo;s answers to them on this earth. The pouring out of God&rsquo;s answers to our prayers is equivalent to His universal administration. This Administrator is qualified in every way, yet He needs our prayers. We may say that Christ is administrating the whole universe through our prayers. The executing of God&rsquo;s administration is motivated by the prayers offered to Him from the incense altar. The prayer offered at the incense altar governs the universe.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">8. The Eternal King</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:15-18 and 12:10 indicate that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the eternal King.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Kingdom of the World Having Become<br />
the Kingdom of Our Lord and of His Christ,<br />
and His Reigning Forever and Ever</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; This verse indicates that after God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth, the earth will be taken over by and returned to God so that Christ will reign in His kingdom on the earth forever and ever. The kingdom of Christ will be everlasting in that it will last not only for a thousand years but for eternity without end. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s reigning forever and ever is the Lord&rsquo;s reigning in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:5). He will reign as a king forever and ever. We will also reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:12). All the overcomers will reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6), and all the saved ones will reign forever and ever in eternity (22:5b).</p>
<p>After Christ executes His judgment upon the nations at His coming back, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Dan. 7:13-14; 2:44-45). At the sounding of the seventh trumpet, not only will the great tribulation come to an end, but also this age will be closed, the mystery of God will be finished (Rev. 10:7), and another age, the age of the kingdom, will come for a millennium, a thousand years. When the age of the kingdom arrives, the entire earth will be the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>Today the earth is a worldly kingdom under the rule of Satan. But the day is coming when the Lord, as the King, will regain this world. Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; The world spoken of in Revelation 11:15 is the earth that the meek will inherit in Matthew 5:5.</p>
<p>Christ alone is the proper Owner of the earth. He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom would be established on it (13:44). Every inch of this earth belongs to Christ. We do not agree that any part of the earth belongs to anyone else. All others are usurpers; Christ is the unique Owner. Moreover, He is coming back to take possession of the earth (Rev. 10:1-2). If we truly know the New Testament, we will see this clearly. Wherever our travels may take us, we need to learn to declare, &ldquo;This is my Lord&rsquo;s property. Temporarily it is usurped by the enemy, but one day my Lord will come to claim what is His.&rdquo; Sooner or later, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.</p>
<p>Revelation 11:15 is a part of a promise that God made to Jacob in Genesis 35:11, which says, &ldquo;A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, / And kings shall come forth from your loins.&rdquo; First, we have &ldquo;a company of nations,&rdquo; indicating multiplication, and then we have &ldquo;kings,&rdquo; indicating the kingdom. Following Jacob, there was the nation of his descendants. Then there was the kingdom of his descendants under David and Solomon. In the New Testament there was the kingdom under his descendant, Jesus Christ; in the next age there will be the millennial kingdom; and after that, the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and the new earth. This one matter of the kings requires all the subsequent books of the Old Testament and the New Testament for its fulfillment. Even the church today as God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth is included in this promise. Everything in Jacob&rsquo;s life is a type to be fulfilled by us. We should not be satisfied to have one or two people saved through us. Rather, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am not happy with this. I want to see the kingdom. I need the multiplication that will issue in the kingdom.&rdquo; This is a great matter. We should have the faith for it, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I would have the faith to be multiplied, not for my empire but for Your kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. He, Lord God the Almighty, Who Is and Who Was, Having Taken His Great Power and Having Reigned</h2>
<p>When the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back (Dan. 7:13-14; 2:44-45), the twenty-four elders will fall on their faces and worship God, saying, &ldquo;We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned&rdquo; (Rev. 11:17). Here it is difficult to determine to whom the word <em>You</em> refers. This is because verse 15 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s reigning, but in verse 17 it is the Lord God the Almighty who is reigning. Does the word <em>You</em> in verse 17 refer to Christ or Lord God the Almighty? In other words, is it Christ or Lord God the Almighty who reigns? Although this is ambiguous, we may say that it is both Christ and Lord God the Almighty who reign. In these verses we see the Divine Trinity&mdash;God, who is three-one. The Bible often refers to the Divine Trinity in an ambiguous way. Because certain terms in the Bible reveal the Divine Trinity in an ambiguous way, it is difficult to discern which one of the Trinity they refer to. It is often better to attribute such terms to the entire Triune God.</p><h2 class="head4">c. His Judging the Dead and Rewarding His Slaves<br />
the Prophets, the Saints, and Those Who Fear His Name, the Small and the Great</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:18 goes on to say, &ldquo;The time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>Your</em> refers to both Christ and God. This again implies the trinity of the Godhead.</p>
<p>The positive aspect of the seventh trumpet includes (1) the coming of the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom in its manifestation (vv. 15, 17); (2) the judgment of the dead before the resurrection of the saints (v. 18); and (3) the giving of the reward, at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), to the prophets and the saints after the resurrection and rapture of the saints (1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17), and the giving of the reward, at the throne of God&rsquo;s glory (Matt. 25:31-34), to those who fear God&rsquo;s name (Rev. 14:6-7).</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Judging the Dead</h2>
<p>Since in Revelation 11:18 <em>for the dead to be judged</em> is mentioned before <em>to give the reward to Your slaves,</em> the former must not refer to the judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (20:11-15). Rather, it refers to the fact that at the close of this age, before the millennium, according to John 5:27-29, the dead will be judged concerning who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium (1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 20:4-6) and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium (vv. 11-12). Before Christ resurrects the saints, He will first make a judgment among the dead regarding the first resurrection of life and the second resurrection of condemnation. After He makes this decision, the resurrection of the saints will take place.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Rewarding His Slaves the Prophets, the Saints,<br />
and Those Who Fear His Name</h2>
<p>At His coming back, Christ will reward His servants. The reward will be given by the Lord to His faithful ones at His coming back (22:12; Matt. 16:27). After the resurrection and rapture of the saints (1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17), Christ at His judgment seat will judge the prophets and the saints (2 Cor. 5:10) to determine who among the saved persons is worthy of a reward and who needs further discipline.</p>
<p>Christ will also reward the God-fearing people. Revelation 11:18 also specifically mentions that a reward will be given &ldquo;to those who fear Your name.&rdquo; Those who fear God&rsquo;s name are the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; mentioned in Matthew 25:33-40. They are those who will heed the eternal gospel, fearing God and worshipping Him and not worshipping Antichrist and his image (Rev. 14:6-7).</p>
<p>After Christ comes back to earth and establishes the throne of His glory in Jerusalem, the center of His kingdom, He will judge the nations, who are all the living unbelievers. The New Testament indicates that Christ has been appointed to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). He will judge the living after He fights the war at Armageddon and destroys Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers (Rev. 19:11-21). At that time, there will be a large number of unbelievers still living on earth. According to Matthew 25:31-46, Christ will gather all the nations to His throne in Jerusalem and judge them.</p>
<p>Many think that this judgment refers to the judgment exercised upon Christians to determine who is real and who is false. But we need to consider what Matthew 25:31-32a says: &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory. And all the nations will be gathered before Him.&rdquo; In the New Testament the word <em>nations</em> refers to the Gentiles. Matthew 25:32 goes on to say, &ldquo;He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&rdquo; This judgment will be neither according to the law nor according to the gospel of grace; it will be according to the eternal gospel preached by the angel in Revelation 14:6-7. During the three and a half years in which Antichrist will force people to worship his image, an angel in mid-air will proclaim the eternal gospel, telling the people on earth not to worship the image but to fear God and worship Him. Some of the inhabitants of the earth will heed this eternal gospel. They will fear God and worship Him rather than the image of the beast, and they will also care for the needy Jews and Christians who will be suffering under the persecution of Antichrist. Therefore, in Matthew 25:34-36, the King will say to those on His right hand, &ldquo;Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.&rdquo; When these righteous ones ask the Lord how they could have done this to Him, He will answer, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me&rdquo; (v. 40). During the great tribulation these &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will care for His little brothers, that is, the believers who suffer persecution and the Jews who fear God. Hence, they will be transferred into the millennial kingdom as the nations on the earth (Rev. 2:26; 12:5).</p><h2 class="head4">d. The Salvation, the Power, the Kingdom of Our God, and the Authority of Christ Having Come</h2>
<p>In Revelation 12:5 there is the birth of the man-child. The man-child signifies the overcomers who have the authority to rule over the nations. This man-child will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens. When the man-child is raptured to the throne, there will be a great battle in the heavens against Satan, and Satan will be cast down to the earth (vv. 7-9). Today the enemy, Satan, is still in the heavens, but once the overcomers arrive there, he will have no place but will be cast down. Once he has been cast down, a loud voice will declare, &ldquo;Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ&rdquo; (v. 10). Here Christ is spoken of as &ldquo;His Christ,&rdquo; the Christ of God. Again this implies the trinity of the Godhead, for Christ is God Himself (Rom. 9:5).</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Our Prayer for the Coming of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s desire today is to establish His kingdom in us. To be a Christian is not merely a matter of being holy and victorious; it is a matter of submitting to the authority of the kingdom. To be a Christian is not only a matter of grace, enjoyment, life, and power; it is also a matter of allowing Christ to have the right to govern us, constitute us His kingdom, set up His throne, and carry out His will in us. When there is a group of people in the church who are willing to allow Christ&rsquo;s authority to flow among them, this will bring Christ&rsquo;s kingdom to the earth. When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth. At that time the church will be victorious, and the enemy will be powerless.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers fight against Satan to usher in God&rsquo;s kingdom. The Lord taught us to pray for the coming of the kingdom (Matt. 6:10). May the Lord grant us mercy and show us that His prayer is for the unlimited spread of the kingdom of God on the earth and in the whole universe. Of course, in order to carry out such a plan of God, there is the need for God&rsquo;s people to pray sufficiently. The true prayers of God&rsquo;s people are for His kingdom. We may pray for numerous things, but unless the ultimate purpose is for God&rsquo;s kingdom, those prayers are of no value before God. We admit that in the Lord&rsquo;s prayer there is the matter of dealing with sins and the matter of the daily living, but its beginning and ending are entirely for the kingdom of God. In the beginning it says, &ldquo;Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (v. 10). At the end it says, &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever&rdquo; (v. 13). Therefore, this prayer shows us that He wants our prayer to be wholly for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>The situation in Revelation 12 depicts the true prayers of the saints. There we see the woman bringing forth a man-child (v. 5). The woman signifies the totality of the redeemed ones. The man-child signifies the stronger part of the redeemed people, that is, the overcomers. We need to realize that the woman and the man-child whom she brought forth have prayed (v. 2). Their voices have reached God; hence, following the rapture of the man-child there is war in heaven. Consequently, God&rsquo;s enemy is cast out from heaven to the earth. Then there is a loud voice in heaven saying, &ldquo;Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ&rdquo; (v. 10). Hence, once God&rsquo;s people utter the real prayers, the result is always the ushering in of God&rsquo;s kingdom. On the other hand, without the prayers of God&rsquo;s people, there is no way for God&rsquo;s kingdom to come. The coming of the kingdom is absolutely related to our prayers.</p>
<p>The examples in the Old Testament also confirm this. When the children of Israel were in captivity, Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the nation of Israel was in complete collapse. At that time, God raised up several men of prayer in Babylon. Daniel and three of his friends were competent in prayer. Their prayers brought in the kingdom. God&rsquo;s kingdom had come to the earth through David, but after Solomon&rsquo;s time it was defeated again. In Babylon Daniel was praying precisely for this matter so that God&rsquo;s kingdom might be brought back once more to the earth (Dan. 6:10). It was completely due to Daniel&rsquo;s prayer that God was able to build the temple, restore Jerusalem, and have the dominion. Therefore, we must be clear that whether or not God&rsquo;s kingdom can come and whether or not He can rule on earth all depend on whether or not God&rsquo;s people will pray. The ultimate purpose of prayer is for bringing in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Our Fighting for the Kingdom&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p>Along with our praying for the kingdom&rsquo;s coming, we need to fight for it. The coming of the kingdom has two aspects: the reality of the kingdom (Matt. 5:3), which is in the proper church life today (Rom. 14:17), and the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium, which will be brought in through the overcoming believers. The phrase <em>now has come...the kingdom of our God</em> denotes the manifestation of the kingdom of God. If we are the overcomers, we are living in the reality of the kingdom today. Since we are in the reality of the kingdom now, we will certainly be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the future. Being in the manifestation of the kingdom requires us to be in the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation opens with the kingdom. In Revelation 1:9 John tells us that he was our brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus. He is our companion in the kingdom. The Lord&rsquo;s intention in Revelation is to open up the matter of the kingdom to all the saints. Yet in the first few chapters of Revelation, the lampstands as the churches are revealed, not the kingdom. This means that, practically speaking, the churches are the kingdom. The proper church life is the reality of the kingdom. The churches are not simply for the churches but for the kingdom. In Revelation John does not say that he is one of the members of the Body of Christ but that he is our companion in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus. Tribulation is needed for the kingdom, and endurance is needed for tribulation. If we would enter into the kingdom, we must suffer. To bear the suffering we need a certain amount of endurance. This is not our endurance but the endurance of Jesus.</p>
<p>The first few chapters of Revelation show us our participation in the kingdom. God&rsquo;s intention for the church is to have the kingdom, and for this, all His believers must be matured to the extent that they can live in the reality of the kingdom and bring in the manifestation of the kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom will simply be the maturity and the ultimate growth of the kingdom life. When we live in the reality of the kingdom in its ultimate state, that will be the manifestation of the kingdom. God&rsquo;s purpose is to have the church, which can bring in His kingdom. The redemption of Christ is to bring in the kingdom. The normal church life is simply the reality of the kingdom, and this reality will consummate in the manifestation of the kingdom. One day the kingdom of God will be manifested. That will be the fulfillment of Revelation 12:10. The kingdom of God will come in full manifestation.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many genuine Christians have not seen this view and are short of this experience. Most have fallen below the standard of the normal church life. Therefore, in the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, the Lord Jesus sounded forth a call, not to the unbelievers but to the believers. Every believer has been called once by the Lord. But in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord Jesus sent forth a second calling to the believers, a calling to be overcomers. We all have been called to believe, and we all have been called into the church life. But many are still short of the Lord&rsquo;s purpose and not up to the normal level which is adequate to bring in the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Revelation begins with the kingdom in chapter 1 and also declares the coming of the kingdom in chapter 12. This indicates that Revelation is a book on the kingdom. Matthew contains the seed of the kingdom, the Epistles contain the growth and development of the seed of the kingdom, and Revelation contains the harvest of the seed of the kingdom. The first aspect of the harvest of the kingdom is the seven lampstands, and the ultimate harvest of the kingdom will be the holy city, New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is simply the harvest of the kingdom to the uttermost. In the New Jerusalem the kingdom will be fully manifested. Even the millennium will not be the ultimate manifestation of the kingdom. But the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the ultimate consummation and fullest manifestation of the kingdom. In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, there will be the eternal kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Coming of the Salvation of God</h2>
<p>When the manifestation of the kingdom comes, the salvation of God will come in full with the kingdom. God&rsquo;s salvation has already been manifested to us today, but it will come in full in the kingdom age. It is the same with the power of God and the authority of His Christ. We have participated in God&rsquo;s power and Christ&rsquo;s authority today, but our full enjoyment of them will be in the kingdom age.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">9. The Lamb Whom<br />
the Overcoming Firstfruits Follow</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:1-4 reveals Christ as the Lamb whom the overcoming firstfruits follow. In the Old Testament typology the sheaf of the firstfruits of the good land was brought into the temple and offered to God directly for His enjoyment. In the New Testament reality, the one hundred forty-four thousand overcomers will be the firstfruits in God&rsquo;s new creation offered to Him directly in the heavenly Holy of Holies for His satisfaction.</p>
<p>These early overcomers will be the first-ripe ones in God&rsquo;s field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. The harvest will be reaped later, in verses 14 through 16. This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11). Exodus 23:19 says, &ldquo;The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God.&rdquo; This shows us that the rapture of the firstfruits to the heavens is typified by the firstfruits being brought into the house of the Lord for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. The events recorded in Revelation 14:6-13, all of which will take place during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), indicate clearly and prove strongly that the first overcomers, the firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5, will be raptured before the great tribulation, and that the harvest in verses 14 through 16, composed of the majority of the believers, will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The one hundred forty-four thousand, firstfruits to God and the Lamb, in Revelation 14 will be raptured to the throne of God. These one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits will not be taken to the air; rather, they will be taken to the heavens, even to the heavenly Mount Zion, the center of the heavenly Jerusalem. The firstfruits are a small part of the harvest which ripens first. This signifies that as God&rsquo;s chosen people are growing on earth, a small number among them will become the firstfruits, the overcomers.</p>

<h2 class="head5">1) Standing on Mount Zion</h2>
<p>The Lamb, whom a hundred and forty-four thousand overcoming believers follow, is standing on Mount Zion. In the universe there are two Zions: one in heaven and one on earth. The earthly Zion is one of the mountains on which Jerusalem was built. The other is the heavenly Zion in the third heaven where Christ with the Father is today. The earthly Zion is the reflection of the heavenly Zion. In Revelation 14:1 Mount Zion does not refer to the one in Jerusalem on earth but the one in the heavens. The heavenly Zion is the final resting place of the overcomers.</p>
<p>In typology the firstfruits are brought into the temple to be presented to the Lord. God Himself enjoyed the freshness of the firstfruits. In any type of farming, there is the farm, the barn, and the farmer&rsquo;s home. The barn is always between the farm and the home. The farmer does not take the firstfruits into the barn but into the home for his own enjoyment. Then, later, the harvest is brought into the barn. Our Father&rsquo;s home is the temple on the heavenly Mount Zion. Therefore, the firstfruits of His farm will not be brought into the &ldquo;barn&rdquo; in the air, but to the temple which is on Mount Zion in the heavens. Then the harvest will be brought into the &ldquo;barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firstfruits in Revelation 14 are before the throne of God; they are no longer on this earth. This means that they have been raptured. They are on Mount Zion in the heavens, before the throne of God. They are standing not in the air but upon the throne, upon Mount Zion. This refers to Mount Zion in the heavens where God dwells. Thus, the firstfruits go not to the air, that is, to the barn, but directly to the Father&rsquo;s home in the third heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) With a Hundred and Forty-four Thousand</h2>
<p>One hundred forty-four thousand must be an actual number with a symbolic meaning. One hundred forty-four thousand is one thousand times twelve times twelve. Twelve is the number of completion in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. One hundred forty-four (Rev. 21:17) is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way. The number here is one thousand times this ultimate completion.</p>
<p>The biblical number twelve is not composed of six plus six but of three times four. The New Jerusalem is a city of twelves&mdash;twelve foundations, the names of twelve apostles (v. 14), twelve gates, twelve angels, the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (v. 12), twelve pearls (v. 21), twelve months, and twelve kinds of fruit (22:2). The height of its wall in 21:17 is one hundred forty-four cubits (twelve times twelve), and its dimensions in verse 16 are twelve thousand stadia (a thousand times twelve). In every aspect the New Jerusalem is a city of twelves. We know that the number twelve in the New Jerusalem is composed of three times four by the fact that the city has three gates on each of its four sides (v. 13). Undoubtedly, the number three signifies the Triune God. The portrait of the New Jerusalem in chapters 21 and 22 reveals the Triune God. In 22:1 we see the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life. Here we have the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dispensing Himself into the city. The city itself represents God&rsquo;s creatures signified by the number four (4:6). In the New Jerusalem it is not a matter of three plus four but of three times four. Today our number is seven, as in the seven churches, the seven lampstands. But in eternity our number will be twelve, three multiplied by four, signifying the mingling of the Triune God with man. Hence, the number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling is for the completion of God&rsquo;s economy, the completion of God&rsquo;s economic administration.</p>
<p>In Revelation 14 it is not simply the number twelve, but a thousand of twelve times twelve. Twelve times twelve means completion in God&rsquo;s administration for God&rsquo;s economy. This is similar to the titles <em>Song of Songs, Lord of lords,</em> and <em>King of kings.</em> Twelve multiplied by twelve means completion of completions. This completion is not temporary but eternal. The New Jerusalem will declare to the whole universe that God&rsquo;s redeemed people will be twelve among twelve, completion among completions. When we are in the New Jerusalem, we will be the completion in God&rsquo;s administration for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy for eternity. But in chapter 14 we have a thousand of twelve multiplied by twelve, a thousand times completion of completions. Twelve times twelve multiplied a thousandfold means maturity upon maturity. This is the significance of the number one hundred forty-four thousand. The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are believers who are for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. In short, the number one hundred forty-four thousand indicates that every living overcomer is a part of the completion of God&rsquo;s administration in the fulfillment of His economy for eternity. To be a living overcomer is a great matter. To be one of the firstfruits is to be for the completion of God&rsquo;s administration to fulfill His economy for eternity.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Having His Name and the Name of His Father<br />
Written on Their Foreheads</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:1 indicates that the one hundred forty-four thousand have the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. They are in contrast to those who worship the beast and have the name of the beast written on their foreheads (13:16-17). That these early overcomers have the name of the Lamb and the name of the Father written on their foreheads signifies that they are one with the Lamb and with the Father and that they belong to the Lamb and to the Father. It also signifies that the overcomers have become the same as the Lamb and the Father. This corresponds with Revelation 3:12, which says that the Lord Jesus will write His new name upon the overcomer. This indicates that eventually the overcomers become Christ. Likewise, the overcomers&rsquo; bearing the name of Christ, the Lamb, and His Father implies the union and mingling of the redeeming Triune God and His redeemed people. This is exceedingly profound.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Their Following Him Wherever He May Go,<br />
and Their Being Purchased from among Men<br />
as Firstfruits to God and to Him</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:4 goes on to say, &ldquo;These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.&rdquo; The firstfruits are the faithful followers of the Lamb. It is not that the Lamb follows us but that we follow Him wherever He goes. The overcomers&rsquo; following the Lamb wherever He may go indicates that they constantly enjoy and experience Him. They follow Jesus and are not defiled by the earthly things. We all must learn the lesson of following Him wherever He goes.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Following Him Wherever He May Go</h2>
<p>Revelation 14 does not say that the firstfruits will be raptured. This is because these overcomers followed the Lamb all the time. Because they were always with the Lamb, having followed the Lamb wherever He went, they are seen in Revelation 14 standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion. Because they are already in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the rapture will not come as a surprise to them. They are living in the heavens today, and they will be standing with the Lamb in the heavens on Mount Zion in the future.</p>
<p>The condition for growing quickly to be one of the firstfruits is to follow the Lamb. Wherever He goes, we follow Him, and by following Him we grow more quickly. Then we will be the firstfruits.</p>
<p>These one hundred forty-four thousand as the firstfruits have grown unto maturity ahead of others. Their faster ripening is the result of their receiving the most supply from the Lord. By following the Lamb &ldquo;wherever He may go,&rdquo; this supply has been their portion. Some of us are satisfied with the supply that we receive from the meetings. Apart from the meetings, when we are at home, we may not seek any supply. Of course, the supply from the meetings is better than nothing. But there are some who are continually with the Lord, following Him all day and every day, and these receive a greater supply. Wherever they are and whatever their situation may be, they grow. This implies that the Lamb whom they follow is ministering the life supply to them.</p>
<p>The principle in becoming the firstfruits is that we must follow the Lamb wherever He goes. However, following the Lamb is not an outward matter, as though we follow the Lamb as our example. It is not that since the Lamb was patient and humble, we must imitate His patience and humility, or that because the Lamb was absolutely for God, we must also be absolutely for Him. This is a natural understanding of following the Lamb. If the element of the Lamb does not get into us, we will be unable to follow Him. Unless we are lambs, it is impossible to follow the Lamb. To follow the Lamb means to allow the Lamb to get into us. When the element of the Lamb is constituted into our being, we will actually be a part of the Lamb. We will be unable to be what we were before because we have been transformed. Our transformed being is the firstfruit. We need to allow the element of Christ to saturate and permeate our being, constituting us with this element. Although we need to pray more, if we simply pray in a common way, we will not be supplied. We need to constantly be open to the Lord. We must permit the element of Christ, the divine constituent of Christ, to work in us continually to saturate and permeate our whole being.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:4 is a strong verse related to growing in Christ as a lamb. Those who are faithful follow the Lamb wherever He goes. To follow Christ as the Lamb is to raise Him as a lamb for a burnt offering. We may raise Christ as a lamb in our daily life by living Him as the Lamb.</p>
<p>The lamb typifies Christ as the One who is obedient to God. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was absolutely obedient to God. Philippians 2:8 says that He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was the highest expression of His obedience. In the words of Romans 5:18 and 19, in the sight of God that obedience is regarded as a righteous act. The &ldquo;one righteous act&rdquo; is in particular ascribed to that single act of Christ in which He was obedient to God unto the death of the cross.</p>
<p>As a lamb, Christ was not only obedient to God but also meek before man. Isaiah 53:7 says, &ldquo;He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.&rdquo; According to the Bible, to be meek means to not resist or fight against what happens to us. Rather, it is to suffer attack and oppression. Meekness is a characteristic of lambs. Unlike dogs and cats, which fight back, lambs do not resist. The four Gospels reveal that Christ was obedient and also meek.</p>
<p>We should live Christ by taking Him as the Lamb. To live by Him as the Lamb means that in so many things we take Him as the One who is obedient to God. We have this One as our obedient life, even as our obedience to God, and He lives in us a life of obedience. Actually, it is not we who are obedient; it is Christ who is the obedient One living in us, Christ the Lamb by whom we live. Eventually, we will raise Christ as a flock of lambs. This does not mean, of course, that there is more than one Christ. Christ is uniquely one, but in our experience we may have Him in many ways.</p>
<p>In Exodus 29 the lamb is not for propitiation; rather, the lamb is a burnt offering as food for God. It was offered to God for Him to eat. Many Christians have never heard that Christ may be offered not only for propitiation but also as food for God&rsquo;s eating. For this reason, Exodus 29 does not mention blood with respect to the lambs. The blood is for redeeming, for propitiation, and for atonement; it is not for eating. But the lambs offered as the burnt offering were wholly for God to eat (vv. 38-42).</p>
<p>God eats His food with fire. When God comes to eat the food that we have prepared for Him, He will eat it by His holy, consuming fire. The way to raise Christ as a lamb for a burnt offering is for the whole lamb to be burned. This means that it is absolutely for God. No part of the lamb of the burnt offering was for the offerer or for the priests. The lamb was God&rsquo;s food and was entirely for His eating. We need to live by Christ as the Lamb, as the One obedient to God and meek before man. Then in the meetings we will have Christ as many lambs to offer to God as food for His satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Being Purchased from among Men<br />
as Firstfruits to God and to Him</h2>
<p>Purchased from among men, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those who follow the Lamb absolutely and who have become the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. That they are purchased from the earth indicates that they are redeemed ones, a part of the church. The phrase <em>from the earth</em> proves that they are no longer on the earth but have been raptured to the heavens (Rev. 14:3).</p>
<p>In Revelation 12 the rapture of the man-child, who fights against God&rsquo;s enemy, is for a function before God. God needs the man-child to be raptured to the heavens to fight the battle with His enemy so that the enemy might be defeated and cast down to the earth for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. In the same principle, the firstfruits in chapter 14 do not merely enjoy the rapture but satisfy God&rsquo;s need. God and the Lamb need enjoyment. God is hungry and thirsty. He desires some firstfruits to taste for His satisfaction. On the one hand, the man-child fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose by defeating His enemy, and on the other hand, the firstfruits are for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. As the firstfruits offered to God in the temple for His satisfaction, the living overcomers enjoy the rapture in order to take care of God&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>We should pay attention to our maturity so that we may be the firstfruits to satisfy the heart of God. For us to give God this enjoyment, we need to be matured. If we are still immature, how can we be the firstfruits and be raptured? Instead, the Lord will have to leave us in the field until we ripen.</p>
<p>In order to be the firstfruits, we must love the Lord Jesus. We need to tell Him how much we love Him, and we need to remain with Him in a loving way. We should spend our time in loving the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I enjoy looking at You and talking to You. Lord, I want to satisfy You, to be one with You, and to stay in Your presence.&rdquo; We should learn to spend time loving the Lord Jesus in an intimate way. If we have never had such a time, we are short. It is not adequate merely to be sinless; neither is it sufficient simply to be good or right. We must be in love with the Lord. We all need to fall in love with the Lord Jesus, telling Him, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You, and You know that I love You. Because I love You, Lord, there are certain things that I will not do.&rdquo; This is the way to be a living overcomer. Although the Lord certainly needs the man-child to fight against His enemy, even more He needs the firstfruits, His lovers, to be His satisfaction.</p>
<p>We have seen that in type, the firstfruits were brought into God&rsquo;s house, the temple, for His satisfaction. This was even true of the Lord Jesus as the firstfruits (1 Cor. 15:20, 23). On the morning of His resurrection, the Lord did not allow Mary to touch Him. He said, &ldquo;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father&rdquo; (John 20:17). Here the Lord was indicating that He had to present His freshness in His resurrection to His Father, for His Father must be the first to taste the freshness of His resurrection. We should learn to present ourselves in a fresh, intimate, and loving way to the Lord for His enjoyment. If we decline to do or touch certain things simply because we are afraid of something, we are not on the high plane of being a lover of the Lord. Rather, we are down on a lower level. We must be on the highest plane, refusing to do certain things, not out of fear but out of love for the Lord. The sisters desire to be with their husbands instead of going home to their parents because they love their husbands. Likewise, because we love the Lord, we will refrain from doing certain things. We may have the liberty, and it may not be wrong to do them, but simply because of our love for the Lord Jesus, we would not do them.</p>
<p>We should be firstfruits, those who ripen earlier for the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, for the sake of Your satisfaction, I want to ripen early. Lord, I don&rsquo;t care for my rapture. I care for Your satisfaction. I want to be taken to the heavens to satisfy You. Lord, as long as I can satisfy You, it makes no difference to me whether I am on earth or in heaven.&rdquo; This is the attitude of the living overcomers.</p>
<p>Because it does not matter to the firstfruits where they are, we are not told that they are caught up; instead, we are simply told that the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion. As we have pointed out, this surely is not the Zion on earth but the Zion in the heavens. If we are one of the living overcomers, it will make no difference to us whether or not we are raptured. Because we are already in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the rapture will not come as a surprise. It does not matter to us whether we are in His presence here on earth or there on Mount Zion. When we get there, we will not be surprised. Those who are raptured as the firstfruits will have no feeling of surprise. Rather, they will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I have been with You continuously for years. Lord, it makes no difference whether I am on earth or in the third heaven. I have no special feeling about being here because I have been in Your presence for years. I have lived in this atmosphere for a long time.&rdquo; To the outsiders, it would come as a surprise if they saw us standing on Mount Zion, but it should not be a surprise to us. It should be a common experience. If we truly love the Lord and live in intimate fellowship with Him, the rapture will not come as a surprise; it will be an ordinary experience.</p>
<p>The church as the testimony of Jesus is God&rsquo;s farm to grow the divine crop (1 Cor. 3:9). This crop is first the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits, a small number, and then the harvest, the majority (Rev. 14:1-5, 14-16). This indicates that in the church life we all need to grow. Verse 4 shows the way to grow. This verse says concerning the firstfruits, &ldquo;These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.&rdquo; In order to grow, we need to stay away from any kind of defilement. Daniel and his three friends were offered the best food in the royal palace in Babylon, but Daniel purposed in his heart not to defile himself by eating food that had been offered to idols. In this way, these young men kept themselves from being defiled (Dan. 1:5-6, 8). Everywhere on the earth today there is defilement. We must be careful not to be defiled, and we must also follow Jesus wherever He goes. If we follow Christ, we will not go to places of defiling worldly entertainment, because Jesus never goes there. If we separate ourselves to the Lord, we will grow every day, and we will be the firstfruits produced by the church life.</p>
<p>If we mean business in the church life, we will grow in life. In the local churches, the crop is growing. If we simply come to the church meetings and follow the flow of the divine life, we will not remain the same but will grow in life. The church in our locality must be fertile soil, and we must all grow in life.</p>
<p>The church is a farm to grow Christ. If we attend the church meetings, the divine life within us will begin to grow and sprout. The divine life within us will make us glowing and shining persons because the church is God&rsquo;s farm. Some on this farm will be the firstfruits. They will ripen first because they are growing more quickly. In a wheat field the grains which ripen first are those nearer the center of the field whereas the grains on the edges ripen last. They need to be left for a longer time in the field to be scourged and burned by the bright sun. Then they too will be ripened and ready to harvest. If we desire to ripen early to be among the firstfruits, we need to be in the center of the church life. We should not stay on the edges of the church life. If we remain in the corners of the church life, we may miss the rapture of the firstfruits and be left to ripen on the earth during the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Today God is moving in the overcomers by growing in them (Col. 2:19). He is making them mature to arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13; Col. 1:28b). The maturity comes out of our growth in life. In Ephesians 4 we see that we are growing up into the Head in all things and that all the Body causes the growth of the Body (vv. 15-16). This growth comes from God&rsquo;s growing in us. The growing is God&rsquo;s operating, and the operating is God&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>According to the description in Revelation 14, the firstfruits are the saints who are saturated with the Lord Jesus. They are the ones who have been fully occupied with Christ and taken over by Christ until they are matured. Our heart should ache for many of the Lord&rsquo;s children who seem to be ignorant, careless, and dull concerning the need to be matured. How serious it is that we are God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s crop! We need to consider how mature we are. Will we be among the firstfruits or the harvest? We need to take this word seriously and bring this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p>We all should heed the warning and realize that we need to be mature. We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me that I would be a part of the firstfruits and that I would be an overcomer.&rdquo; We need to see God&rsquo;s purpose and intention, and we need to see our responsibility to cooperate with Him. We should enjoy Christ, participate in Him, and take Him in until we are matured.</p>
<p>Christ is the seed, He is the growth, He is the transformation, and He is even the firstfruits and the harvest. Whoever gains Him the most will be at the top of the harvest and will be among the firstfruits. Those who are the firstfruits spoken of in Revelation 14 will be among those who will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(20)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Son of Man as the Reaper</h2>
<p>In Revelation 14:14-16 we see that for our experience and enjoyment Christ is the Son of Man as the Reaper. In the Old Testament, after the reaping of the firstfruits came that of the harvest. Likewise, in Revelation 14 we see first the rapture of the firstfruits, the overcoming believers who ripen earlier, before the great tribulation, and then we see the rapture of the harvest, the majority of the believers on earth, toward the end of the great tribulation. A small number of the New Testament saints who ripen early will become the firstfruits to be offered to God directly on Mount Zion, the third heaven. Christ will then come back with the overcomers and will reap the majority of the saints on earth as God&rsquo;s harvest. When the firstfruits ascend to Mount Zion, the heavens, Christ is with them (v. 1). But at the time of the harvest, Christ as the Son of Man comes down from the heavens to the air, descending on the cloud seen by others.</p>
<p>As the Son of Man, Christ will be the Reaper. The harvest was sown by Christ in the four Gospels, and the sowing resulted in a good harvest on the earth, which He will reap in Revelation 14. Matthew 13 is the sowing of the seed, and Revelation 14 is the reaping of the harvest, the issue of the growth of the seed. All that Christ sowed in Matthew 13 He will reap in Revelation 14.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Sitting on the White Cloud, Having a Golden Crown on His Head and a Sharp Sickle in His Hand</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:14 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&rdquo; Christ came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown. At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man. As the Son of Man, He is qualified to execute God&rsquo;s judgment on everyone (John 5:27). At this time He will no longer be wrapped, or concealed, in the cloud but will be sitting on the cloud. Prior to this, His coming is hidden, but at this point it will be open and visible. In Revelation 10:1 Christ is still clothed with a cloud, whereas in chapter 14 He is on the cloud. This corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4:17 and indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s coming back is now made public.</p>
<p>Surely in the third heaven, where God dwells, there are no clouds. But in the air surrounding the earth, there are many clouds. In Revelation 10:1 the Lord is clothed with a cloud, but in 14:14 He is sitting on the cloud. This indicates that He is now in the air.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:14 further says that He will have &ldquo;a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&rdquo; The golden crown on the Lord&rsquo;s head indicates that Jesus is the Lord and that the Lord is the One crowned with glory (Heb. 2:9). The sharp sickle in the Lord&rsquo;s hand indicates that the Lord is the One who reaps God&rsquo;s field.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Thrusting His Sickle upon the Earth,<br />
and the Harvest of the Earth Being Reaped</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:15-16 says, &ldquo;The harvest of the earth is ripe. And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.&rdquo; The harvest of the earth is God&rsquo;s people on earth, the believers in Christ (1 Cor. 3:9). At His first coming to the earth, the Lord sowed Himself into His believers (Matt. 13:3-8, 24). All the believers since that time, who have received Him as the seed of life, have become God&rsquo;s crop on the earth. The first-ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation, as indicated in Revelation 14:1-5. The majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped, raptured, at the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>In light of the truth concerning the rapture of the saints, we need to prepare ourselves, to make ourselves ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming by watching and praying. We need to watch and pray so that we can grow and mature in the divine life. Then we will mature earlier and be raptured before the hour of trial, the great tribulation (3:10).</p>
<p>The tribulation may be likened to the scorching, parching sun. The suffering of the great tribulation will &ldquo;dry&rdquo; the earthly waters from the remaining believers so that they may ripen. To be ripe is to have all the earthly water dried out. This means that we all need to grow so that we may become ripe for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>The end of Revelation 14:15 indicates that the prerequisite for the reaping is being ripe, but before the great tribulation, the harvest will still be green. No farmer would reap a green crop; thus, the entire field must ripen. When the field has ripened, the time of the harvest will come. The reaping mentioned in Revelation 14:16 will take place after Antichrist forces people to worship him and his image (v. 9). Hence, it refers to the rapture of the majority of the believers who are left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 indicates that the rapture will occur in parts. In the physical type, firstfruits are reaped early, and the general harvest may be reaped a few weeks later. The firstfruits are the fruits that ripen first. Because the rest of the harvest is green, it is left in the field until the earthly waters, the earthly supply, are dried up. Then the harvest will be mature and ready to be reaped. Whereas the overcomers as firstfruits are raptured to the temple of God, the majority of the believers as the harvest are raptured to the air (1 Thes. 4:17), that is, to the barn, which is between the field and the farmhouse. In Matthew 13:39 the Lord Jesus indicated that the crop will be harvested at the completion of this age, which we have not yet reached. Before the time of this reaping, the firstfruits will be ripened and raptured.</p>
<p>In Revelation 14:15 an angel says, &ldquo;Send forth Your sickle and reap,&rdquo; and verse 16 says, &ldquo;He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.&rdquo; The sickle in these verses signifies the angels sent by the Lord to reap the harvest (Matt. 13:39). At the time of His coming, the Lord Jesus will send His angels to take the believers out of the field, the world. The angels will first bind the tares, the false believers, to be thrown into the fire and then gather all the wheat, the true believers, into the barn. This corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4:17, which says that the believers will meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. The Overcoming Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 17:14 indicates that we also may experience and enjoy Christ as the overcoming Lamb. Christ overcame, He is still overcoming, and He will overcome.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Overcoming Antichrist with His Ten Kings,<br />
for He Is Lord of Lords and King of Kings</h2>
<p>Revelation 17:14 tells us that, because Christ is &ldquo;Lord of lords and King of kings,&rdquo; He as the Lamb will overcome Antichrist with his ten kings of the ten kingdoms within the revived Roman Empire (vv. 12-13). Christ, who is God, became a man, lived on earth, died on the cross for our sins as our Redeemer, was buried, was resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven, and has been enthroned as the Lord and Head of all. Now Christ is the sovereign Lord of lords and King of kings. One day He will come back to rule over the earth and set up His kingdom with the overcoming believers as co-kings.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. They Who Are with Him Being the Overcomers,<br />
the Called, Chosen, and Faithful Saints</h2>
<p>Verse 14 goes on to say, &ldquo;They who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who are with Him&rdquo; are the overcoming saints who become the heavenly army. These are the overcoming saints in the New Testament age who will be the heavenly army to join Christ in fighting Antichrist and his kings. The Lord does not want to fight the battle by Himself. In principle, when the Lord deals with the enemy, He needs the saints as His army. Therefore, in order to be overcomers, we need to enjoy Christ as the real Overcomer today so that at His coming, we will enjoy Him as our Leader to fight God&rsquo;s enemy and annihilate him.</p>
<p>In verse 14 the word <em>chosen</em> is mentioned after <em>called.</em> To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord by virtue of an overcoming life. Today many are called, but in the future few will be chosen (Matt. 22:14). We have been called, but in order to be among the chosen in the future we need to live an overcoming life today. The chosen ones are those who are faithful to the Lord and who will become His army. These are the followers of Christ, the ones who have been raptured, who fight the battle against Antichrist and his army at Armageddon.</p>
<p>These overcomers are the bride of Christ, who will come down from the heavens with her Husband to fight against Antichrist. Those who have overcome every obstacle will be Christ&rsquo;s co-fighters in the final battle against Antichrist. They have become His co-fighters by His ministering the rich life supply to them.</p>
<p>The burden of the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to present a feast full of the riches of Christ revealed in the New Testament. The New Testament unveils the riches of the all-inclusive Christ, and each of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament may be considered an all-inclusive meal containing His riches. The New Testament reveals so many aspects of this rich Christ that they are far beyond our apprehension. Although the riches of Christ are inexhaustible, it is wonderful that they are unveiled to us for our experience and enjoyment. The extent to which we can appropriate the riches of Christ depends upon our capacity. May we continue to see how rich our Christ is and to enjoy Him in all His riches.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">12. The Lamb as the Bridegroom</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:7-9 unveils that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb as the Bridegroom. Similarly, in the Gospel of John, Christ is presented both as the Lamb and as the Bridegroom. One day John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (1:29). This verse clearly reveals that Christ came as the Lamb to take away the sin of the world. Later, John the Baptist also indicated that Christ is the Bridegroom. John said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice&rdquo; (3:29). Hence, in the Gospel of John, Christ is revealed both as the Lamb who came to take away sin and as the Bridegroom who came that He might have the bride. Although most Christians are familiar with the former aspect of Christ, only a few pay attention to the latter aspect. The Lamb is for redemption, and the Bridegroom is for the wedding. The redemption was accomplished by Christ as the Lamb of God, and the wedding will take place when Christ as the coming Bridegroom takes His bride.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s goal is not to remove sin&mdash;it is to have the bride. In the book of Revelation, which is also written by the apostle John, we see again that Christ our Redeemer is the Lamb and the coming Bridegroom. Therefore, as the Bridegroom, He must have a wedding. The wedding of the Lamb will be a universal wedding. It will be the marriage of the Redeemer and the redeemed. At the end of the Bible we see a city, the New Jerusalem. This city is the wife (21:2, 9-10), and the redeeming God is the Husband. Our position is that of the bride, and the position of the coming Christ is that of the Bridegroom. We are on the earth being prepared to become the bride to meet Him, and He is on the throne in the third heaven prepared to come as the Bridegroom to meet us. Thus, He is coming as the Bridegroom, and we are going as the bride (Matt. 25:1). The bride and the Bridegroom will meet, neither in heaven nor on the earth but in the air. When we meet Him in the air, we will have a wedding.</p>

Bright and Clean, the Righteousnesses of the Saints</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Marriage Dinner of the Lamb Having Come</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:1-6 is the praise of the great multitude of the saints, the angels, and all creatures. Revelation 19:7-8 continues, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; Here <em>His wife</em> refers to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8-9, the wife, the bride of Christ, consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The wife of the Lamb in Revelation 19 is the aggregate of all the overcoming saints from Abel until the Lord&rsquo;s return. The aggregate of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers is the wife in Revelation 19:7 who will be ready for Christ&rsquo;s wedding. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this aspect, building is needed. The overcomers are not only mature in life but also built together as one bride. Christ will not marry each believer individually; instead, He will marry His corporate bride composed of His overcoming believers. When we have been fully saturated with the Triune God so that He flows out of us, we will be completely built and fitted together to become the glorious church, the beloved bride of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>We also need to see that only the church as the golden lampstand can be the bride of Christ (1:20). This indicates that we need to live out the life of Christ. Although this goes against our human concept, we should not focus on caring for the goodness or wickedness that comes out of us. Instead, we need to care for the tree of life, the Triune God, and Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. Whether we are at home with our family or in the church meetings with the brothers and sisters, we all need to live out Christ. If we live by Christ, what we live out is God, who is Spirit, signified by the pure gold that shines forth the light; then we will become the bride of Christ who satisfies His desire.</p>
<p>We must be the bride for Christ. When we are eager to be the bride, Christ will receive His satisfaction. Not only will Christ be satisfied, but we also will be satisfied. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult.&rdquo; In principle, a bride is the most pleasant and happy person. Today as the church, Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, we are suffering and undergoing many dealings. But the day is coming when there will be no more persecutions, sufferings, or dealings. When we have become the bride, all the difficult dealings will be over.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19:6 the voice of the great multitude proclaims, &ldquo;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.&rdquo; The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of the Lamb, and the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is that Christ would obtain the bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;working together to obtain the bride for the Son. The Father made the plan, the Spirit carries out the Father&rsquo;s plan, and the Son enjoys what the Father has planned and what the Spirit carries out. The bride is a part of the human race who will marry the Son and become His counterpart. Matthew 28:19 speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In Acts and the Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father&rsquo;s plan to obtain the bride for the Son. The entire New Testament is simply a record of the Triune God working together to gain a part of the human race to be the bride, the counterpart, of the Son. At the end of the New Testament, in the book of Revelation, we see the bride. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, the goal of the Triune God will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride with the overcoming believers will be ready. Simultaneously, the kingdom of God will come. This corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 26:29, which speaks of the kingdom of God&mdash;the kingdom of Christ&rsquo;s Father&mdash;in which Christ will drink with us after His coming back.</p>
<p>The wedding will bring in the reign of the Lord, the kingdom, because all the guests invited to the wedding will be both the corporate bride and the co-kings of the Bridegroom. The Bridegroom, who will take the whole earth as His kingdom, certainly needs many sub-kings to be His co-kings. All His co-kings will be His corporate bride.</p>
<p>The wedding, which will take place in the air, will last a short time. After the wedding, there will be the wedding feast. A wedding feast is always much longer than the wedding. Matthew 22 indicates that the wedding feast will be the millennial kingdom. To the overcomers, the thousand years of the millennial kingdom will be a wedding feast. To the Lord, a thousand years are like one day (2 Pet. 3:8). Everyone invited to the wedding feast will also participate in the thousand-year reign as kings. Our King will be the Bridegroom; we, His co-kings, will be His bride; and the thousand years will be our wedding feast and honeymoon with our Bridegroom, Christ.</p>
<p>Many Christians will not receive the reward of reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom. Although we may be saved, we must become an overcomer in order to receive the kingdom as our reward. For the overcomers, reigning with Christ in His kingdom will be the wedding feast.</p>
<p>The Bible is truly the divine book. Genesis 1:1 is necessary, but there was no Hallelujah when God created the heavens and the earth. The Hallelujah comes in Revelation 19:6-7 when the time has come for the marriage of the Lamb. A wedding is the happiest time in human life, yet a human wedding is only a shadow. The real wedding is the marriage of the Lamb, the wedding of Christ and the church. When we meet as the church today, we are joyful because we experience a foretaste of the wedding feast of Christ and the church. When the time has come for the marriage of the Lamb, the Hallelujah comes. The church life is a foretaste of that wedding day. In the church life we are happy because we are enjoying the foretaste of the wedding feast.</p><h2 class="head5">2) His Wife Having Made Herself Ready</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to the phrase <em>His wife has made herself ready.</em> Matthew 25:1-13 speaks of the parable of the ten virgins. In this parable the prudent virgins who took oil in their vessels&mdash;who had the Spirit of God filling and saturating their souls&mdash;were those who &ldquo;were ready&rdquo; and thus went in with the bridegroom &ldquo;to the wedding feast,&rdquo; into the enjoyment of the marriage dinner of the Lamb at His coming back (v. 10). This indicates that God&rsquo;s work throughout the generations is to build Himself into man. He is the God of heaven, who possesses not only the nature of God but also the element of heaven. When He builds Himself into us, He constitutes the nature of God and the element of heaven into us. The more we allow Him to work Himself into us, the more we will have the element of God and the element of heaven in us. We all have had this experience. When we submit to the Holy Spirit, allowing God to work Himself into us, we have the presence of God and the taste of heaven within us. We can grow as God builds Himself into us. God&rsquo;s building and our growth are for the preparation of the bride. For the bride to have made herself ready means that the church has been built up. The bride signifies the church in its ultimate state. The bride having made herself ready means that the church has been completely built up and has grown to maturity.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 25, when the Lord comes back, those who are ready will sit with Him at the wedding feast. To be ready here means that the bride has made herself ready, that God has completed His building work in man, and that we have grown and matured in the Lord&rsquo;s life. These three matters&mdash;God&rsquo;s building in us, our growth in the Lord&rsquo;s life, and our getting ready before the Lord&mdash;are all linked together. God&rsquo;s building work in us is our growth in the Lord&rsquo;s life and is also our getting ready before the Lord. These three matters are actually one matter.</p>
<p>The church today is a miniature of the glorious New Jerusalem in the future, and it will continually grow until the day that it is fully grown. We grow through God&rsquo;s continuous building work in us. The more God builds Himself into us, the more we grow. Without God&rsquo;s building work we cannot grow. Our growing is actually God&rsquo;s building (Eph. 4:12-13).</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Revelation 19 will be completely fulfilled. Furthermore, we believe that the process of fulfillment is taking place today. The bride, however, cannot be prepared quickly. This preparation is a gradual work that takes place over a period of time. Certainly the Lord must be doing a work on earth to prepare His bride. This preparation involves the work of a corporate building. Those who make up the bride must not only be mature in life; they must also be built together as the one bride. The primary work of the Lord in His recovery is to prepare His bride. In His recovery He is calling out a remnant of those who love Him and who are faithful to Him. He is sending out the call to overcome the degradation of Christianity so that a number of those who seek Him may be prepared as His bride.</p>
<p>The bride, the wife, of Christ will be prepared in full by Him for His wedding as His pleasure and satisfaction. The preparation of the bride is by Christ&rsquo;s redemption, organic salvation, and the intensified work of His organic salvation. Revelation 19 says that the bride is prepared fully by being properly adorned. Christ is now adorning us to make us His bride. Christ&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction are His bride, prepared, adorned, in full. The coming of the marriage dinner of the Lamb in Revelation 19:7 refers to Christ&rsquo;s marrying the New Jerusalem as His bride in the millennium.</p>
<p>God in the beginning was merely God. He was alone. But it is not good for God to be alone (Gen. 2:18). He desires a counterpart. Jesus came not merely to be the Redeemer but to be the Bridegroom, and as such He needs a bride (John 3:29). Paul says that he had betrothed the Corinthian believers as a pure virgin to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). Ephesians 5 reveals that the church is the wife of Christ, and Christ is the Husband. Then in the book of Revelation we are told that the wife has made herself ready and that the marriage of the Lamb has come (19:7). This will be a universal marriage in which the overcomers will marry Christ, our God. From that time God will never be alone. Our God will be a married God. He will marry the holy city, the New Jerusalem, as His bride. At the beginning of the Bible, God is looking for a counterpart. At the end of the Bible, He is no longer alone; He is with His bride. This is a picture showing us God being mingled with corporate humanity. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head5">3) It Being Given to Her That She Should Be<br />
Clothed in Fine Linen, Bright and Clean,<br />
the Righteousnesses of the Saints</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:8 says, &ldquo;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; Here the fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints, refers to Christ lived out of us in our daily life. This indicates that while the church is under great degradation, we should be the overcomers to live Christ and even live Him out as our subjective righteousness day by day. In the eyes of God the fine linen is the Christ expressed in our daily life.</p>
<p>In verse 8 the word <em>clean</em> refers to the nature, whereas <em>bright</em> refers to the expression. The Greek word translated &ldquo;righteousnesses&rdquo; may also be rendered &ldquo;righteous acts.&rdquo; The righteousnesses do not refer to the righteousness (which is Christ) that we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30). The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God, whereas here the righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective (Phil. 3:9) and enable us to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ. Hence, the fine linen indicates Christ, as our overcoming life, whom we live out of our being.</p>
<p>The righteousness that is Christ Himself is sufficient for us to be justified and saved; this righteousness is singular in number. The use of <em>righteousnesses</em> in Revelation 19:8 is in the plural, however, and proves that what is mentioned in this verse is not Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified. Rather, it is righteous deeds, the daily walk, the Christian living, which Christ as our life works out through us. This outworking of the inner life is the white linen with which we are clothed. In order to attend a feast, especially a wedding feast, we must dress in a proper way. In the same way, we need the proper clothing in order to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the whole Bible, we, the saved ones, need two garments&mdash;one for our salvation and one for our reward. For our salvation we need a robe to cover us. This robe is the robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15. Upon his return, the prodigal son said, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son&rdquo; (v. 21). He thought himself unworthy to be in the presence of the father. But the father said to his servants, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him&rdquo; (v. 22). This robe is Christ as our righteousness. It is for us to be justified by God in His presence. We all have this first robe, which is Christ as our righteousness, our justification, that enables us to stand before the righteous God.</p>
<p>However, we also need the second garment. This garment is not for our salvation; rather, it is for our reward, qualifying us to attend the wedding feast of the Son of God. The first garment qualifies us to meet God for our salvation. The second garment qualifies us to meet Christ for our reward. This second garment is the work of the Holy Spirit within us. It is actually the Christ by whom we live and whom we live out. It is the Christ expressed through us in our daily living.</p>
<p>The second garment is also the righteousness spoken of in Matthew 5:20. In this verse the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This verse clearly indicates that we must have a righteousness that surpasses the righteousness of the Pharisees. This righteousness is not the objective Christ whom we receive as our robe for our justification. Rather, it is the subjective Christ whom we live out as our daily living. It is not the justifying robe; it is the garment that qualifies us to receive the reward.</p>
<p>This is also illustrated by the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12. In this parable the Lord spoke of a man who comes into the wedding feast without a wedding garment. The king, seeing the man, says, &ldquo;Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?&rdquo; The guest is speechless. Then the king says to his servants, &ldquo;Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (v. 13). The wedding garment is not the justifying garment; it is a very special garment. According to the custom of the ancient Jews, no one could attend a wedding feast without a special wedding garment. If we would be in the wedding feast of the Lamb, we must be clothed with such a garment. If we would be qualified to attend the wedding feast of Christ, we need to live by Christ and live Him out in our daily living. This Christ, the subjective Christ, will be the wedding garment to qualify us to be admitted into the wedding feast. Therefore, we need both the justifying garment and the wedding garment.</p>
<p>The second garment is also referred to in Revelation 3:4, 5, and 18. In 3:4 and 5 the Lord told the church in Sardis that those who have not defiled their garments will walk with Him in white and that the overcomers will be &ldquo;clothed...in white garments.&rdquo; This is the garment for the wedding feast. In 3:18 the Lord advised the church in Laodicea to buy from Him &ldquo;white garments.&rdquo; Thus, in the book of Revelation the matter of the second garment is stressed. If we do not have it, we will miss the wedding feast.</p>
<p>These two garments are also seen in Psalm 45. In this psalm the queen has two garments (vv. 13-14), one corresponding to the objective righteousness for our salvation and the other to the subjective righteousness for our victory. The latter is equivalent to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12. The queen in Psalm 45 signifies the church. Her first garment is inwrought with gold, and her second is embroidered clothing. In the Bible gold signifies the nature of God. At the time of our salvation we received a golden garment that enabled us to be in the presence of God. In addition to this, we need another garment, a garment of embroidery. This embroidery signifies the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit today is working on us to transform us, just as an embroiderer puts many stitches into cloth. Although we have the first garment, our second garment is now being prepared under the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit. This garment will qualify us to see Christ at His judgment seat. Day by day we are under the needle, the transformation work, of the Holy Spirit. This is because we need not only justification but also approval. When we appear before the judgment seat of Christ, will He approve of us? Only those who have the second garment produced by the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit will be chosen and qualified to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The bride in Revelation 19 is clothed with fine linen, bright and clean&mdash;the righteousnesses of the saints. This is Christ growing in and living out of us. When we live out Christ by letting Him grow in us, He will be our living. The only way for Christ to grow in us and live out of us is by our eating and drinking Him all the time.</p>
<p>For the bride to be prepared means that she has the fine linen, bright and clean. No doubt, these righteousnesses are related to the righteousness in Ephesians 4:24, where we are told that the new man was created in righteousness. The fact that the clothing of the bride is clean, or pure, means not only that it is without dirt but also that it is without mixture. The righteousnesses of the bride here denote the subjective righteousness, Christ as the righteousness which has been constituted into our being. The more this subjective righteousness is wrought into the church, the more she is prepared to become the bride. Those who compose the bride have been redeemed and regenerated. But they also need to have the subjective righteousness interwoven into their being in order to have the fine linen, bright and clean. Actually, it is this linen that is the beauty of the bride.</p>
<p>The bride in Revelation 19 refers to the redeemed and transformed tripartite mankind. This bride will wear white linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints. If we would have a share in this bride, we need to adorn ourselves with the bright, shining, and pure righteousness. Day by day we need to prepare bright linen clothing to cover ourselves. This is our daily righteousness. We produce such a garment of righteousness by walking daily according to the Spirit of life and by having a life that is a life of the Spirit. If we prepare our wedding garment day by day, month by month, and year by year by living such a life in the Spirit, we will not be found naked when the Lord comes. Instead, at His coming, we will be wearing a bright and clean, or pure, wedding garment (3:18).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the bride in Revelation 19 will become the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22. The city of New Jerusalem will bear the appearance of jasper. Speaking of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:11 says, &ldquo;Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.&rdquo; According to Revelation 21:18, &ldquo;The building work of its wall was jasper.&rdquo; Also, the first foundation of the New Jerusalem will be jasper (v. 19). Therefore, the appearance of the entire city will be that of jasper. Revelation 4:3 indicates that God sitting on the throne in the heavens also has the appearance of jasper. Hence, jasper denotes God&rsquo;s image, His expression. The fact that jasper is the appearance of both God and the New Jerusalem indicates that this holy city will bear the same appearance as God. The entire city will express God. The jasper of the New Jerusalem is equal to the righteousness of the bride. Today we are preparing our bridal gown, a gown that will have the appearance of righteousness, which is the expression of God. Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem this will be the appearance of jasper.</p><h2 class="head4">b. They Who Are Invited to the Marriage Dinner<br />
of the Lamb Being Blessed</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&rdquo; The bride of the Lamb and the guests invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb refer to the same group of persons. In other words, those who constitute the bride of Christ are the guests invited to the wedding feast.</p>
<p>The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers will be invited to it, not all the saved ones. The five foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be invited to the wedding feast of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will also be the bride of the Lamb. The blessing referred to in Revelation 19:9 is the blessing of participating in the millennium. To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ.</p>
<p>Matthew 22:14 says, &ldquo;Many are called but few are chosen,&rdquo; and Revelation 17:14 says, &ldquo;They who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful.&rdquo; To be called is one thing, but to be chosen is another. Those who will follow the Lord to fight against Antichrist will not only be called but also chosen. Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we will be chosen. This will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ. After we have been raptured, we will stand before the Lord at the judgment seat, and He will decide whether or not we are qualified to be chosen. Only those who are chosen will be invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The marriage of the Lamb will follow the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. If we are not rewarded but are disapproved by the Lord, we will not perish; however, we will suffer a loss like that described in 1 Corinthians 3:15, which says, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo; The saved ones who suffer loss will certainly miss the wedding feast. The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will not determine whether we will be saved or perish; it will decide whether we will receive a reward from the Lord or suffer a loss.</p>
<p>Eventually, when Christ comes, the overcoming believers will join Him to feast at the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7, 9). That unique, universal wedding feast will last one thousand years. During those thousand years the church is the bride, and after the one thousand years the church is the wife (21:9-10). The difference between a bride and a wife is that the bride is the bride only on the wedding day. After the wedding day the bride becomes the wife. On the wedding day there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife. The millennial kingdom of one thousand years will be a wedding day to Christ, in which the overcoming believers will be with Christ, enjoying His wedding feast.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking Christ in order to feast on Christ is the central thought in God&rsquo;s economy (1 Cor. 5:7-8). The beginning of the Christian life is a feast. The Lord Jesus likens the gospel of God&rsquo;s full salvation to a great dinner (Luke 14:16-23). The penitent sinner is not only clothed with Christ the Son as the God-satisfying righteousness to judicially redeem him but is also brought to the Father&rsquo;s house to feast on the rich Christ to organically save him (15:22-23; 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 3:8).</p>
<p>The continuation of the Christian life is a feast. The Christian life continues with the Lord&rsquo;s table until He comes (1 Cor. 11:24-26). The divine concept is that to remember the Lord is simply to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him. The Lord&rsquo;s table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink. Even while we are fighting on the battlefield, the Lord spreads a table before us in the presence of our adversaries for us to feast on Him (Psa. 23:5).</p>
<p>The consummation of the Christian life is a feast. The overcoming believers will feast for a thousand years on a special portion of the unsearchably rich Christ at the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9; Matt. 26:29; Luke 22:30; 13:29). This is a feast that will last for eternity (Rev. 22:1-2).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord said that the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and who sent his slaves to call the invited ones to come to the feast (22:2-4). Then Revelation 19 speaks of the coming of the marriage of the Lamb and the marriage dinner of the Lamb (vv. 7, 9). This indicates that the New Testament not only begins with a feast but also ends with a feast. When we attend a proper church meeting, we are enjoying a foretaste of the marriage dinner of the Lamb, the wedding feast prepared by God the Father for His Son. At the Lord&rsquo;s return, the overcoming believers will enjoy the marriage dinner of the Lamb. At the marriage dinner of the Lamb, the believers will enjoy a special portion of Christ. A wedding feast is not ordinary food but a special portion. At that time, the Lord Himself will be a special portion for the overcomers to enjoy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

King of Kings and Lord of Lords</h2>
<p>In Revelation 19:11-16 and 19-21, Christ is revealed as the Word of God&mdash;King of kings and Lord of lords&mdash;who returns to defeat and destroy Antichrist and the false prophet. After His wedding feast, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride, the overcoming believers who are His army, to fight Antichrist, the kings under him, and their armies at Armageddon. These three will continue to oppose Him. Under the instigation of Antichrist, man will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Antichrist, the false prophet, and the ten kings and their armies will make war against the Lamb. This war will be a fighting of the earth against the heavens, of man against God. Christ&rsquo;s enemies will become all the more evil, even declaring war against Him. It is indeed astounding that man could actually declare war on God. Therefore, Christ, the Bridegroom, will come with His bride to fight against them.</p>
<p>In 19:11-21 we see that the Bridegroom comes to fight against His enemies with the help of His bride. The Bridegroom is the Commander-in-chief, and the bride is the army. This will be a honeymoon for the newlywed couple. During His honeymoon Christ will clear up the universe. Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire (v. 20), and Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). At that time Christ will be happy, and we, His bride, will also be happy as we enjoy a wonderful honeymoon with our Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The war at Armageddon will remove all the obstacles to the coming millennial kingdom. Before we can have a feast, we must clean up the feasting room. In the millennial kingdom the entire universe will be the feasting room, and Christ and His bride will work together to sweep away the dirt, which will be put into the &ldquo;trash can,&rdquo; the lake of fire. God&rsquo;s sweeping in the universe began in Genesis 1. First, God swept the dirt into the sea (v. 2); at that time the sea was the trash can in this universe. Eventually, all the dirt will be put in the ultimate trash can, the lake of fire. In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.&rdquo; Because the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; followed the devil, they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for him and his angels. God has prepared the lake of fire as a &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; to dispose of all the trash in the universe. Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the &ldquo;dust pan&rdquo; and then dumped into the lake of fire. After the millennium Satan himself will join them there. After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers will also be cast into the lake of fire. From that time onward, there will be no more dust. In the New Jerusalem there will be only gold, pearl, and precious stones. The Lord&rsquo;s fighting in the war at Armageddon will actually be a sweeping of the dirt into the universal trash can. Antichrist&rsquo;s declaration of war on Christ will give Him the perfect opportunity to sweep Antichrist away, and the bride of Christ will cooperate with Him in doing this.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord that we are not trash; rather, we are a treasure. Instead of being cast into the lake of fire, we will be gathered into the New Jerusalem. In order for the Lord to enjoy a pleasant honeymoon and the thousand-year kingdom, all the trash must be swept away. We should look forward to participating in this cleaning work. How pleasant it will be!</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Faithful and True&mdash;Sitting on a White Horse&mdash;Judging and Making War in Righteousness</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:11 says, &ldquo;Behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.&rdquo; <em>Faithful and True</em> will be a title of Christ. Christ is faithful both to God and to those who believe in Him. In His faithfulness He defeats and destroys those who oppose God and persecute the believers. He is true in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy and in caring for those who believe in Him. He is trustworthy, and with Him there is no falsehood.</p>
<p>Christ is God&rsquo;s faithful and true Witness who sits on a white horse, judges in righteousness, and makes war. Christ will come back to fight against Satan&rsquo;s power of unrighteousness, which today operates in the world as the mystery of lawlessness and which will issue in Antichrist, the man of lawlessness (2 Thes. 2:3, 7-8). The entire earth is under the satanic power of unrighteousness. In righteousness Christ will return to make war against the unrighteousness practiced by Antichrist and all his partners.</p>
<p>Christ will not only judge in righteousness but also fight in righteousness. He judges by fighting. Even today, no wrongdoers would accept the judgments of our courts if the government had no police force to back up these judgments; judgment can be executed only by police power. When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious. Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and to judge these rebels in righteousness. His judging by fighting is not only according to righteousness; it is also to maintain righteousness.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19 Christ, the Bridegroom as the Commander-in-chief, appears riding on a white horse. The horse of the first seal in 6:2 is also white and signifies the preaching of the gospel. Thus, both Christ and the gospel ride on a white horse. In the book of Revelation, white indicates being clean, pure, just, and approvable. This is vastly different from what is indicated by the colors of the other three horses in chapter 6&mdash;red, black, and pale green. Even today we are riding on this white horse. Our preaching of the gospel is clean, pure, just, and absolutely approvable by the Lord. Christ will ride on this horse as He fights against His enemy.</p>
<p>Those who preach the gospel become the riders of the white horse. According to the Bible, we should preach the gospel to lead sinners to salvation. We all need to bear fruit. Although we may admit that this is scriptural, we may not be bearing any fruit. This means that we are not on the white horse. If we are preaching the gospel, our interest on the earth is in God&rsquo;s kingdom. We should be those who are laboring to help people to be saved in order to build up the Body of Christ for the kingdom of God. Most of us need to work to make a living, but all of us can separate a certain amount of time to the Lord for His interest. The unbelievers can always spare time for their amusement and entertainment, but we believers have God as our amusement and entertainment. We have no excuse for not preaching the gospel. We must be on the white horse for the spreading of the gospel.</p>
<p>The white horse includes not only preaching the gospel but also having home meetings, feeding the young ones, holding group meetings for perfecting, and prophesying to build up the church. If we do not preach the gospel to save sinners, feed, nourish, and cherish the young ones, gather the new ones together for a group meeting, or have the capacity and ability to prophesy for the building up of the church, we are not on the white horse. We need to take this way; we must not stop the white horse.</p><h2 class="head4">b. His Eyes Being a Flame of Fire, on His Head<br />
Being Many Diadems, and Having a Name Written<br />
Which No One Knows but Himself</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:12 goes on to say, &ldquo;His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s eyes being &ldquo;a flame of fire&rdquo; signifies His judging eyes. He will judge according to what He sees. His flaming eyes will carry out His judgment. As the Warrior, Christ has many diadems on His head. Every kind of glory is a diadem. Christ is crowned and glorified. Because He has been crowned with many kinds of glory (Heb. 2:9), He wears many diadems.</p>
<p>As the One on the white horse, the Lord has &ldquo;a name written which no one knows but Himself.&rdquo; This indicates that there are certain aspects of Christ that we have not experienced and that only He Himself knows. These are secrets concerning Christ that He keeps within Himself. Even though we may experience and enjoy Him to the uttermost, there will still be aspects of Christ that will be kept secret from us; they will not be known even by His closest overcomers. This indicates that the Christ whom we experience is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>When we experience Him, we come to know a particular aspect of Him. However, there are certain aspects of Christ that will not be experienced by us. Only He Himself knows what these aspects are. Because we have experienced His redemption, we know Him as the Redeemer. Because we have experienced Him as light, life, manna, power, strength, holiness, and comfort, we know Him in all these aspects. We have experienced so many items of Christ&rsquo;s riches. But because there are some items that we have not experienced, He still has a name known only to Himself. Therefore, we do not know this name. No matter how much we have experienced Christ, there is still something about Him that remains unknown to us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. His Being Clothed with a Garment Dipped in Blood, and His Name Being Called the Word of God</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:13 continues, &ldquo;He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord Himself is the Word of God. The Lord is clothed with a garment dipped in blood because of His fighting at the battle of Armageddon. The garment of Christ is dipped in blood and becomes red by His treading the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God (v. 15; Isa. 63:1-3) at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16), where the blood will rise up to the bridles of the horses (14:20).</p>
<p>That the Lord&rsquo;s name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God. The Word of God is the definition, the explanation, and the expression of God. In order to know God, we need to read, study, behold, contemplate, and gaze on Christ as the Word of God.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19, as the Word of God, Christ speaks for God by executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon the rebellious people. Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God. The fighting of Christ is the speaking of the Word of God. God is righteous and sovereign. He is also a God of order, and as such He cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion. As Christ fights against the enemy, He will speak that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly. He will declare that God is the God over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority. Hence, the Warrior is the Word. His fighting is the speaking of God&rsquo;s Word. The Lord&rsquo;s fighting in the war at Armageddon will be a powerful speaking. It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him. God is not a God of confusion; He is the sovereign God, a God of order who does not tolerate rebellion. The God of order will sweep away all rebellion.</p>
<p>The Word of God is mentioned both in the Gospel of John (1:1) and in the Revelation of John. In the Gospel of John the Word of God does not speak of anything related to fighting; rather, He speaks of redemption, light, life, and building. In the Revelation of John the Word of God speaks not only of life and building but also of fighting. Before God can have the building He desires, He must first clean up His universe. In this book Christ&rsquo;s fighting is also His speaking for God. As the Word of God, His fighting proclaims to the whole universe what kind of God He is. In the Gospel of John, the Word of God is for the impartation of life into us, but in Revelation the Word of God is for fighting against and defeating God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19 the Lord Jesus who comes down out of heaven appears as a General fighting a battle. He is riding on a white horse, and His name is called &ldquo;the Word of God&rdquo; (vv. 11, 13). The word of God that we speak today is the Lord Jesus. Eventually, as we continue to speak, our speaking will cause the Lord Jesus to come forth. When the Lord comes, He will come as a Warrior, a General. He will fight for His kingdom. In the warfare for the kingdom of God, Christ is the Word of God, speaking for God&rsquo;s purpose. In His fighting against God&rsquo;s enemies for the kingdom, Christ is God&rsquo;s speaking.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">d. His Armies, the Overcomers, Which Are in Heaven Following Him on White Horses,<br />
Dressed in Fine Linen, White and Clean</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 19, the church is both the bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God&rsquo;s enemy. The armies in Revelation 19:14 are the called and chosen believers in 17:14. They are also both the bride and the guests called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (19:7-9). The guests invited to the wedding feast and the bride are the same. The bride consists of the invited guests, and the invited guests make up the bride. After the wedding, all the guests will become the army. As the bride, we must be beautiful, without spot or wrinkle, and be clothed in fine linen. As the warrior, we must be equipped to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19:14 we see that the overcomers, as the armies which are in heaven and the ones who followed Him on white horses, are &ldquo;dressed in fine linen, white and clean.&rdquo; The fine linen here is the clothing of the bride. The wedding garment of &ldquo;fine linen, bright and clean,&rdquo; will be the armor for fighting. The overcomers who are the heavenly armies are those who constitute the bride of Christ. In other words, it will be the bride of Christ who will follow Him as His army to fight and destroy Antichrist and his army. Those who have overcome every obstacle will be Christ&rsquo;s co-fighters in the final battle against Antichrist. These are His bride. They have become His co-fighters by His ministering the rich life supply to them. Surely the expectation is that His overcomers will be such co-fighters.</p>
<p>The overcoming saints have two garments, one for salvation and the other for reward. The fine linen here is the second garment. This second garment of the overcomers qualifies them both to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb (vv. 8-9) and to fight with the Lord against His enemy. Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment. The second garment qualifies us not only to attend the wedding but also to join the army. The bride&rsquo;s wedding garment will be the uniform that she wears as God&rsquo;s army to fight against His enemy. As we have seen, this garment is Christ lived out of us to be our daily righteousness. Even today, we are fighting by Christ as our garment. Ephesians 6 indicates that the whole armor of God is Christ. Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s army will be on white horses as a properly formed heavenly army.</p>
<p>At His coming again, the Lord Jesus first will meet His bride. After receiving the bride, Christ and the overcomers will enter into battle against the enemy. According to Revelation 19:11, the Lord will ride on a white horse, and the armies which are in heaven will follow Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>
<p>Just as in Ephesians 5 and 6 we see the church as the bride and as the warrior, in Revelation 19 we also have these two aspects of the church. As the church, we are the bride and the warrior. In God&rsquo;s economy there is one army constituted of a corporate warrior. This means that the warrior in Ephesians 6 is a corporate entity. Only as a corporate entity, the Body, can we put on the whole armor of God. This is contrary to the concept held by many Christians that an individual believer is able to wear the entire armor. The armor in Ephesians 6 is not for Christians as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body. What this chapter reveals is not the believers fighting as individuals but a corporate army fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s interests on earth.</p>
<p>Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, a corporate entity to fight the battle against God&rsquo;s enemy. No soldier in a modern army would enter into battle by himself. Rather, he would fight as part of a well-trained and fully equipped army. After we have been formed corporately into an army, we will be able to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy. God&rsquo;s strategy is to use the church as His army to fight against the enemy. Therefore, it is very dangerous to be isolated from the army. Only by remaining in the army will we have the necessary protection.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 6, the Lord with His might is the armor that we put on for our protection. This means that we, as the Body, need to put on Christ Himself as our armor. In order to fight in the spiritual warfare, we must have Christ as the whole armor of God. In 6:14-17 there are six aspects of Christ as the armor: the girdle of truth, or reality; the breastplate of righteousness; the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, the shoes; the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit. Therefore, the whole armor of God consists of the girdle, the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword.</p>
<p>According to verses 17 and 18, we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition. Actually, prayer is the means by which we receive all the aspects of the whole armor of God. It is by praying in spirit that we apply the girdle of reality, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes as the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Among the various items of the armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare; that is, it is the only item of God&rsquo;s armor used for attacking the enemy. In spiritual warfare we must deal not only with the objective enemy but even more with the subjective adversary. Satan is not only the enemy outside of us; he is also the adversary within us. Today we face a greater problem with the inward adversary than with the outward enemy. The attacks of the enemy from without are not as serious as those of the adversary from within. To deal with this inward adversary, we need to experience the killing power of the word. Yes, the enemy is outside of us, but his elements are within our being. Because the enemy&rsquo;s elements are within us, we need the killing power of the word to be applied to our being subjectively.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5 the word is for nourishment that leads to the beautifying of the bride, but in Ephesians 6 the word is for killing that enables the church as the corporate warrior to engage in spiritual warfare. Pray-reading the Word of God is the way to kill the adversary within us. Every day and in every kind of situation, we should pray-read. Whenever we are troubled by something negative within us, we should take the Word of God by means of prayer in spirit. As we do this, the negative element will be killed.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul charges us to receive &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; This means that we need to take the word of the Bible as a sword for fighting the enemy. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in this verse, the word of God is the sword not directly but indirectly. Paul speaks of &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; Here we have indirectness. The sword is not the word directly. Rather, the sword is the Spirit directly, and then the Spirit is the word. This indicates that if we would deal with the enemy Satan, the word of the Bible must become the Spirit. If we would use the word of the Bible as a sword to kill the enemy, in our experience the word must be the Spirit.</p>
<p>We need to realize that things such as our opinion, thought, temper, emotion, natural life, and point of view are often used by the powers of darkness in the air to damage the Body life. As brothers and sisters in the church, we all have our emotion, thought, opinion, and natural life, and we all have our own point of view. Quite often we are offended, not due to the wrongdoings of others but simply due to our emotion or opinion. Due to their emotion, sisters are easily offended. Suppose an older brother speaks a word to a particular sister, and she is offended because of her emotion. Then the evil power in the air comes in to take advantage of her emotion, and she determines not to forget that she has been offended. Apparently the problem is her emotion. Actually the problem is that her emotion has been taken over by the evil force in the air. This means that the real enemy is not this sister&rsquo;s emotion but the evil spirit in the air that takes advantage of her emotion in order to damage the church life. If the enemy is to be defeated in this situation, the sister must learn to receive the word as the Spirit, which becomes the sword to deal with the enemy. As we read the Word of God, we receive the word in a living way as the Spirit, and the Spirit, which is the word, becomes the sword that kills our emotion directly and kills the evil force indirectly. The word that we receive as the Spirit then becomes the sword to slay the enemy. Apparently the sword of the Spirit kills our emotion; actually it kills the evil spirit in the air who takes advantage of our emotion.</p><h2 class="head4">e. Out of His Mouth Proceeding a Sharp Sword,<br />
That with It He Might Smite the Nations;<br />
and His Shepherding Them with an Iron Rod;<br />
and His Treading the Winepress of the Wine of the Fury<br />
of the Wrath of God the Almighty</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:15 says, &ldquo;Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.&rdquo; The fighting of Christ in the war at Armageddon will be the treading of the great winepress. That will be the judgment on all the evil forces of the world, the deathblow to all of them. Through Christ&rsquo;s treading, the wrath of God the Almighty will be exhausted. All the grapes, the Gentile military forces, will be gathered into the winepress and will be trodden by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Revelation 14:19 says, &ldquo;The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God.&rdquo; The great winepress of the fury of God is the war at Armageddon (16:12-16), which is in the valley of Jehoshaphat (Joel 3:9-16). All the Gentile evil worldly forces will be gathered there, and the Lord with His overcoming saints will fight against and destroy them there (Rev. 19:11-21; Joel 3:9-13; Isa. 63:1-6). Revelation 14:20 goes on to say, &ldquo;The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.&rdquo; (A stadion, the singular of stadia, was equal to about six hundred feet.) When Christ comes back to earth and destroys these evil fighters, treading the winepress of the fury of God, the result will be a river of blood as high as a horse&rsquo;s bridle and approximately two hundred miles long.</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:8 Paul says, &ldquo;The lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming).&rdquo; The breath of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth signifies the word. Revelation 19:15 speaks of a sharp sword with which He might smite the nations. This sharp sword, a two-edged sword (1:16), is the Lord&rsquo;s killing word. He will send out His word as the breath to slay Antichrist and to consume him. The Lord will also destroy Antichrist with the brightness of His coming. This brightness will be an intensified burning and a killing light. Christ will come with such a mouth and such light to deal with this man of sin. As a result, Antichrist will become the son of perdition and be the first to perish in the lake of fire, and along with the false prophet, he will perish in the lake of fire before Satan will (19:20; 20:10).</p>
<p>The sword, which proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the Word of God, is the word that will judge the rebellious (John 12:48). When the Lord Jesus comes to fight against Antichrist, He will not need modern weapons. The Lord&rsquo;s word is more powerful than any weapon. When the Lord says, &ldquo;Antichrist, go to the lake of fire,&rdquo; we will say Amen, and Antichrist will immediately be cast into the lake of fire. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way of fighting. Undoubtedly, Antichrist will use the most modern weapons, but Christ will defeat him with the sharp sword, the almighty word that proceeds out of His mouth.</p>
<p>The Lord will not only smite the nations but also shepherd them with an iron rod (Rev. 19:15). This is the fulfillment of Psalm 2:8-9, which tells us that Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod. In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. In the millennial kingdom the ruler is a shepherd. To shepherd here means to rule, and the iron rod signifies strong power. Christ will first smite the nations with His judging word; then with His strong power He will shepherd those who remain. His ruling with strong power is His shepherding. He will rule over the nations by shepherding them. Today the elders shepherd the church with love, not with a rod of iron. However, because the nations will still have the rebellious human nature, the Lord will shepherd them during the millennium with an iron rod. That the nations will still have a rebellious nature is proved by the fact that they will follow Satan to make war against Christ at the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:7-9).</p>
<p>Revelation 19 corresponds with Daniel 2, in which we see that the nations devastate Israel consecutively in four empires, from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of Babylon, to Antichrist, the last Caesar of Rome. These four empires that devastate Israel are the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. These four empires are signified by the four parts of the great human image in Daniel 2. The head of gold (vv. 36-38) signifies Nebuchadnezzar, the founder and the king of Babylon. The breast and the arms of silver (v. 39a) signify Medo-Persia, and the abdomen and thighs of bronze (v. 39b) signify Greece, including Macedonia. The legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (v. 33) signify the Roman Empire with its last ten kings (vv. 40-44a; 7:7-11, 19-26; Rev. 17:7-13). At the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) the form and appearance of the Roman Empire will be restored under Antichrist. According to the books of Daniel and Revelation, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire will be Antichrist, who will be supported by ten kings (Rev. 17:10-12).</p>
<p>The four empires will, however, be overcome and terminated by Christ. Daniel 2:34 says that &ldquo;a stone...cut out without hands&rdquo; struck &ldquo;the image at its feet&rdquo; and &ldquo;crushed them.&rdquo; Verse 35 continues, &ldquo;Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found.&rdquo; Here the great human image signifies the aggregate of human government, and the smiting stone signifies not merely the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ. Apparently, the parts that were of gold, silver, bronze, and iron were not a problem to God. But with the ten toes there is a great problem, for when human government reaches the stage of the ten toes&mdash;the stage of Antichrist and his ten kings&mdash;it will fight against God directly. Thus, human government not only rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols but also fights against God directly. However, Christ, the embodiment of God, will come with His bride to crush the human government.</p>
<p>When Christ comes as the smiting stone, He will not come alone. Rather, He will come with His bride. This is because when Christ comes to fight against Antichrist and his army, He will come as the Son of Man. As the Son of Man, He will need a counterpart to match Him and complete Him. This counterpart will be His bride. After gaining and marrying the church as His bride, Christ will come as the smiting stone. If Christ did not have a bride, He would have to fight alone against Antichrist and his army. However, Christ will have an army, and this army will be His bride. On the day of His wedding, Christ will marry the one who has been fighting the battle against God&rsquo;s enemy for years. This means that Christ will marry the overcomers, who have already overcome the evil one, the devil (Rev. 12:11). As the God-cut stone, Christ with His overcomers&mdash;the corporate Christ&mdash;will strike the ten kings with Antichrist (19:11-21), signified by the ten toes of the great human image. In so doing, the corporate Christ will crush the great image from the toes to the head (Dan. 2:35); that is, the corporate Christ&mdash;Christ with His newly-married bride composed of the overcomers&mdash;will come as a stone cut without hands and smite the human government into pieces. In this way, Christ with His bride will annihilate human government.</p><h2 class="head4">f. His Having on His Garment and on His Thigh<br />
a Name Written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:16 goes on to say, &ldquo;He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.&rdquo; The King of kings refers to His authority, and the Lord of lords refers to His headship. He is the authority and the head of the whole universe.</p>
<p>In His ascension, Jesus as a man was inaugurated into the new position of King of kings and Lord of lords to be the Head over all things. He has received all the authority, and He has the name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9). He is higher than all the presidents on the earth. There have been many great men throughout the ages, but all of them died, and few are remembered. However, the Lord Jesus Christ is different. The more people oppose Him, the more transcendent He is and the more people believe in Him; the more people oppress Him, the more He multiplies. If we read history carefully, we will see that the clever kings would not persecute the Christians, because they knew that whoever persecutes the Christians would never have a good end. Hitler, who was the worst persecutor of God&rsquo;s people in modern times, had a very pitiful end, dying without a proper place for burial. History also tells us that governments that persecuted Jesus Christ have fallen quickly. The Manchu dynasty in China was ended because it instigated the Boxers to kill the Christians. This is known as the Boxer Rebellion in modern Chinese history. Christ is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. The Roman Caesars, Napoleon, and Hitler were not the Lord; only Jesus Christ is the Lord.</p>
<p>A day is coming when Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords will appear to the universe. The fact that Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords will no longer be hidden or mysterious. This name will be written upon His garment and upon His thigh; hence, it will be openly revealed and known by all. He will fight for His kingdom. The garment signifies Christ&rsquo;s attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies Christ&rsquo;s standing strength, His stability. His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Antichrist and the Kings of the Earth<br />
and Their Armies Gathering to Make War<br />
with Him and with His Army</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:19 says, &ldquo;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.&rdquo; According to this verse, Christ&rsquo;s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth (16:12-14) especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from &ldquo;the rising of the sun&rdquo; (9:16; 16:12).</p>
<p>The war mentioned in Revelation 19:19 is an actual physical war, not a spiritual one; it is a war between God and man. Specifically, Christ&mdash;as the Son of Man, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords&mdash;with His followers, who are human beings, will fight against Antichrist, also a human being, and the kings of the earth and their armies. Antichrist will fight against Christ directly and personally.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Antichrist Being Seized with His False Prophet,<br />
and They Being Cast Alive into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:20 goes on to say, &ldquo;The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.&rdquo; Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first group to go into the lake of fire, the universal &ldquo;trash can.&rdquo; These two had already died but were raised again, not by God but by Satan. Now they will be the first to go directly into the lake of fire, without passing through further death or resurrection like all the others who perish.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. The Rest Being Killed with the Sword<br />
Which Proceeds out of His Mouth</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:21 continues, &ldquo;The rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse.&rdquo; As the result of the war at Armageddon, Christ will defeat Antichrist, who, with the false prophet, will be cast alive into the lake of fire. Then the rest of Antichrist&rsquo;s armies will be killed with the sword that proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the King of kings and Lord of lords (v. 16). This verse again indicates that the Lord will fight simply by His word, which will be a weapon to kill His enemies.</p><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>

<h2 class="head3">14. The Establisher of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>In Revelation 20:1-4 we see that Christ is the Establisher of the kingdom. After fighting all His enemies, Christ will establish the kingdom of God on the earth, the millennial kingdom, and reign with His overcoming believers for a thousand years. Between the rapture of the overcomers and the beginning of the millennial kingdom, many things will take place. Immediately after the rapture of the man-child, a loud voice in heaven says, &ldquo;Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ&rdquo; (12:10). Actually, the kingdom will not come at that time, for the three and a half years of the great tribulation are yet to come. Nevertheless, in the eyes of those who have been raptured to the heavens, the kingdom has already come. During the last three and a half years of this age, the following things will take place: the rapture of the majority of the saints; the destruction of religious Babylon, that is, the annihilation of Catholicism; the destruction of Judaism; and the fall of material Babylon. Following all this, there will be the war at Armageddon. The whole earth must be cleared up as a preparation for God&rsquo;s kingdom to come. At the time of Revelation 20, nearly everything has been cleared up. Only one thing remains, and that is Satan, the source of all the problems. Therefore, the first item mentioned in Revelation 20, a chapter concerning the millennium, is the binding of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Binding the Devil through an Angel and Casting Him into the Abyss for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:1-3 says, &ldquo;I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be loosed for a little while.&rdquo; Although the Lord judged Satan on the cross, that judgment has not yet been fully executed. Satan is still rampaging on the earth, tormenting God&rsquo;s children especially. When the Lord returns, He will fully execute the judgment that He accomplished on the cross upon Satan. Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss. He will be powerless to act or damage anyone. At that time on this earth there will be no Satan. Then the earth will become Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Following the defeat of Antichrist is the binding and imprisonment of Satan to clear up the rebellious earth so that the kingdom of Christ may come (vv. 4-6). Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, which is in the heart of the earth, and he will be imprisoned there for a thousand years. After that, &ldquo;he must be loosed for a little while&rdquo; (v. 3). Before casting him into the lake of fire, where he will be tormented forever and ever (v. 10), Christ will bind the devil and cast him into the abyss for one thousand years. This is because the devil will still be somewhat useful in fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose at the end of the coming millennium. The abyss may be likened to a temporary jail, and the lake of fire to an eternal prison.</p>
<p>After the war at Armageddon, the Lord will establish His throne of glory in Jerusalem and gather before Him all the nations still on earth. He will then execute His judgment upon them. This will be Christ&rsquo;s judgment of the living carried out according to the eternal gospel preached by an angel in mid-heaven (14:6). The &ldquo;goats&rdquo; will go to the fire prepared for the devil and his angels, and the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will enter into the millennial kingdom as citizens (Matt. 25:32-34). Although these &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will be restored, they will not be regenerated. They will still have a rebellious nature within them; thus, they will need a further test a thousand years later. Because the Lord will use Satan to test them, He will not cast Satan into the lake of fire at the beginning of the millennium. When the thousand years are over, the Lord will release Satan from the abyss and use him to test the citizens who have been on earth during the millennium. Gog and Magog will not pass the test. Under Satan&rsquo;s instigation, they will once more rebel against God. In this we can see that Satan will still be useful in God&rsquo;s hands to purge mankind.</p>
<p>Acts 3:21 refers to &ldquo;the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.&rdquo; This restoration will affect not only man but also the whole creation&mdash;the heavens, the earth, the animals, and even the trees. Everything that was cursed through the fall of man will be restored. Isaiah 30:26 says, &ldquo;The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days.&rdquo; Today the sun and the moon are not normal, because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. As Genesis 3:17 and 18 further indicate, the whole earth has been cursed because of man&rsquo;s fall and is also not in a normal state.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament there are many verses concerning the millennial kingdom (Psa. 2:6, 8-9; Isa. 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 65:20-25; 30:26; Zech. 8:20-23; Psa. 72:1-17; Isa. 4:2-6; 9:7; 12:1-5; 16:5; 32:1-2; 40:9-11; 61:4-9; Zech. 14:16-21). The kingdom was the good news proclaimed to mankind through the prophets in the Old Testament. In particular, there are many prophecies in Isaiah, Zechariah, and the Psalms regarding the millennium. At the time of the restoration, not only mankind but also all of creation will be restored to its original condition. The beasts and the cattle will be restored to such an extent that &ldquo;the wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid&rdquo; (Isa. 11:6). This will not be miraculous; rather, it will be normal and common. Isaiah 11:8 says, &ldquo;The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.&rdquo; When Christ comes again, everything will be restored. The trees will flourish, and the flowers will blossom abundantly. Isaiah 35:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;The wilderness and the desert will be glad; / And the desert will exult and blossom / Like the rose. / It will blossom and blossom, / And even exult with exultation and a ringing shout.&rdquo; Furthermore, &ldquo;water will break forth in the wilderness, / And streams in the desert. / And the desert mirage will become a pool, / And the thirsty ground, springs of water&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). Also, &ldquo;a highway will be there, and a way, / And it will be called, The Way of Holiness&rdquo; (v. 8). The book of Isaiah contains a full description of the millennium.</p>
<p>According to the prophecies of the Bible, the millennial kingdom is in two sections: the upper, heavenly, section and the lower, earthly, section. The upper section of the millennium is called the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43), and the lower section is called the kingdom of the Son of Man (v. 41). The kingdom of the Messiah, or the Messianic kingdom, is another name for the lower section of the millennium.</p>
<p>In the millennial kingdom there will be three peoples. The first are the overcoming saints, including those of both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These overcoming saints will be co-kings of Christ. Christ is the highest King, and we will be His sub-kings. Therefore, the upper section is the royal portion of the millennium.</p>
<p>The second group, found in the lower section, is the preserved and proper Jews, who will be saved at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. According to Zechariah 12:10-14, these Jews will look on Him whom they have pierced, and then they will repent. These are the Jews who will be the third part who will pass through fire and be refined (13:9). These saved Jews will enter into the millennium as priests and will teach the nations to seek God and to know Him. Isaiah 2:2-3 will be fulfilled at that time. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Many peoples will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, / To the house of the God of Jacob, / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths. / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.&rdquo; The nations will learn of God through the instruction of the Jews, who will be priests. Isaiah 61:6 says, &ldquo;You will be called the priests of Jehovah; / People will speak of you as the ministers of our God.&rdquo; This word will also be fulfilled during the millennium, when the nations will recognize the Jews as God&rsquo;s priests.</p>
<p>Zechariah 8:23 says, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah of hosts, In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold, indeed, they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that every Jew will be precious. In those days the Jews will be warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>The third group of people in the millennial kingdom will be the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; spoken of in Matthew 25. We have seen that these &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to become the citizens there.</p>
<p>In the lower section of the millennium, called the kingdom of the Son of Man, Jesus as the seed of David will be King over the Jews and, through the Jews, over all the nations. He will be on the throne of David to be the King over all the nations through the Jews. This is the kingdom of the Son of Man and the kingdom of the Messiah; it is also the tabernacle of David spoken of in Acts 15:16. The tabernacle of David, which is the kingdom of David, has fallen. But when the millennium comes, Christ will re-erect the tabernacle of David. In 2 Samuel 7 God promised to establish David&rsquo;s kingdom forever (v. 16). This eternal kingdom will be the lower part of the millennium, the kingdom of the Son of Man and of the Messiah. The kingly overcomers will be in the upper part of the millennium, and the priestly Jews and the citizens will be in the lower part.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Reigning with the Overcoming Saints</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:4-6 reveals that Christ as the Establisher of the kingdom will reign with the overcoming saints. Because the overcomers bring in the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Lord will reign for a thousand years, and the overcomers will also reign with Christ for a thousand years. Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.&rdquo; The word <em>they</em> refers to the overcomers. They are now sitting upon thrones, and authority to judge has been given to them. To have the authority to judge means to have the kingdom (cf. Dan. 7:10, 18, 22). Therefore, this verse in Revelation 20 indicates that the overcomers have received and are enjoying the kingdom.</p>
<p>Verse 4 also says, &ldquo;I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&rdquo; Those who have been &ldquo;beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God&rdquo; are the martyrs throughout the church age, as mentioned in 6:9. Undoubtedly, Peter, Paul, James, Stephen, and the many others slain throughout the centuries will be included in this group. These saints, martyred for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, will be resurrected to be co-kings of Christ.</p>
<p>The martyrs in the great tribulation are those who do not worship the beast or his image and do not receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand. After the rapture of the overcomers, many saints will be martyred because they refuse to worship Antichrist or receive his mark. These martyred saints will also be resurrected to be co-kings in the millennial kingdom. In principle, these co-kings must also include the raptured living overcomers. If those in the man-child will be among the co-kings, then certainly those making up the firstfruits will be also.</p>
<p>In both Matthew 25:21 and 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.&rdquo; These verses refer to the enjoyment of the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. To the diligent servant the Lord will say, &ldquo;Well done! Come into the joy of your Lord. I have some things I want you to rule over.&rdquo; This will be the enjoyment of the overcoming believers in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>Many mistakenly believe that no matter what kind of Christian they are after being saved, they will suddenly be a king when the Lord Jesus comes back. This is unfounded. Everyone who intends to be a king must be disciplined. If the Lord Jesus came today and put us on thrones as kings, we ourselves might tell Him that we are not qualified. God&rsquo;s intention is not merely to save us initially but to save us to be priests and kings. One born into a royal family needs much training and discipline to become a proper king. Many Christians are poor, having only been saved but never having loved the Lord or agreed to hand themselves over to Him to be disciplined and trained. How can they be His co-kings? Those in Revelation 20 who live and reign with Christ are not merely the saved ones. After being saved, they passed through certain kinds of experiences which made them adequate and prepared to be kings.</p>
<p>The overcomers become qualified to reign with Christ by the humanity of Jesus being worked into them. Christ who is the unique proper man dwells in our spirit as the Spirit of Jesus. Such a One with all the proper human virtues is in us to be our humanity. When we have His humanity, we will put Satan to shame and be the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The overcomers who will reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom will enjoy the best resurrection. Revelation 20:6 speaks of &ldquo;the first resurrection.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;first&rdquo; is the same word translated &ldquo;best&rdquo; in Luke 15:22, where the father says in relation to the returned prodigal, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him.&rdquo; Hence, the first resurrection in Revelation 20:6 may actually be translated &ldquo;the best resurrection.&rdquo; The overcomers will enjoy this resurrection.</p>
<p>The first resurrection is also the &ldquo;ex-resurrection,&rdquo; that is, the extraordinary resurrection for which the apostle Paul sought (Phil. 3:11). The Greek word may be translated &ldquo;the out-resurrection.&rdquo; This means that it is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection, the resurrection with honor, comparable to graduation with honors. This resurrection is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. Hence, &ldquo;blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection&rdquo; (Rev. 20:6). Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living ones, such as the firstfruits in 14:1-5, have part in this resurrection.</p>
<p>Many hold an erroneous view that only believers will be resurrected and that unbelievers will not be resurrected. According to the Bible, however, the unbelievers will also be resurrected. John 5:29 speaks of &ldquo;the resurrection of life&rdquo; and &ldquo;the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium, and the resurrection of judgment is the resurrection of the unsaved after the millennium. The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of life. But all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment.</p>
<p>The first resurrection will also be the resurrection of reward. Luke 14:14 says, &ldquo;You will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.&rdquo; This resurrection is a resurrection with a reward.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:6 says, &ldquo;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.&rdquo; This must be the highest blessing&mdash;to inherit the kingdom manifested on earth and even to be the kings within it. Concerning those who participate in the first resurrection, verse 6 continues, &ldquo;Over these the second death has no authority.&rdquo; This is difficult to understand. The lake of fire is called the second death (v. 14). We have seen that Satan is useful in the hand of God. Likewise, death is also somewhat useful to Him. All negative situations are related to death. All weakness&mdash;physical, mental, and spiritual&mdash;belongs to death. Weakness is a visiting card of death. When death is about to visit a person, it does not come directly. Instead, it first comes in the form of weakness. Weakness is followed by sickness, and sickness is followed by death. Thus, both weakness and sickness belong to death. Moreover, all the troubles and hardships that we face in life also belong to death. When the overcomers enter into the upper section of the millennium to be the co-kings of Christ, they will have no weakness, no sickness, no trouble, and no hardship. In other words, they will no longer be bothered by death.</p>
<p>The death before resurrection is the first death, and the death after resurrection is the second death. The second death, the lake of fire, refers to the death after resurrection. In the first death the spirit and soul leave the body, the body is buried, and the spirit and soul go to Hades; the spirit and soul of the believer go to the section of comfort in Hades, and the spirit and soul of the unbeliever go to the section of torment. The Lord Jesus will determine who among the dead will be resurrected before the millennium and who will be left in the tomb for another thousand years to be resurrected after the millennium. After the unbelievers are resurrected, they will be judged at the great white throne (vv. 11-15). Then the dead unbelievers will be cast into the lake of fire, the second death. This means that even after their resurrection, they will still suffer the second death.</p>
<p>We should not believe, as many Christians do, that after our resurrection everything will necessarily be all right. After our resurrection we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). If there is no possibility that we might still have a problem, why then will we be judged after the resurrection? When we are standing before the judgment seat of Christ, we will be fearful and trembling, wondering what the Lord Jesus will say concerning us. Yes, we are saved, and we are saved for eternity. With this there is no problem. We do not believe that a saved person can be lost again. John 10:28 and 29 indicate that once we have received eternal life, we can never perish. However, in 1 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo; Although we are saved, we may still suffer loss; that is, we may still have a problem. We should not think that after we have been resurrected and raptured, we will immediately go to heaven. No, we must first be examined. We should not expect to go directly into the millennial kingdom to be a co-king of Christ. We must first stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 14:12 says that, as we stand before this judgment seat, &ldquo;each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.&rdquo; Although we may criticize others today, as we stand before the judgment seat, we will have to criticize ourselves. The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will determine whether we will receive the reward to enter into His kingdom or receive some punishment. That punishment will be something related to the second death, just as weakness, sickness, trouble, and hardship are related to the first death.</p>
<p>Today God uses weakness, sickness, trouble, and hardship to discipline us and to chastise us so that we may grow in life. If we die in our immaturity, we should not think that we will suddenly become mature after our resurrection. No, we will be resurrected and raptured in an immature condition. If we die in immaturity, we will also be resurrected in immaturity. Take graduation from school as an example. If you leave school before you graduate and return some time later, you will still have to complete your schoolwork. You will have to continue your studies until you have finished your course for graduation.</p>
<p>We need to grow and mature quickly. We should not delay this process. We must fear the prospect of dying in immaturity. If we die in our immaturity, after our resurrection we will stand in immaturity before the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat. Be assured that this situation will not be pleasant. Everyone in this situation will be dealt with by something related to the second death. This means that even after a believer&rsquo;s resurrection, he may still be touched by something of the second death; that is, the second death may still have some authority over him. Only the overcomers, those who participate in the best resurrection, will not be subject to anything of the second death. They will have graduated from all weakness, sickness, trouble, hardship, and suffering. This is the proper understanding of Revelation 20:6.</p>
<p>Although we are saved for eternity, we still need to grow, mature, and be perfected so that we may be among the co-kings of Christ. If we do not mature, we will suffer loss. If we suffer loss before the resurrection, our loss will belong to the first death. But if we suffer loss after the resurrection, our loss will be related to the second death. Although we may be resurrected believers, we will still be under the authority of the second death, and something of the second death will trouble us. If we are still fleshly and love the world, at the judgment seat of Christ we will need to suffer something in order to mature, and we will need something of the second death to work on us. This is the pure, enlightening, and sobering truth. We need to be enlightened, sobered, and made serious, and we should aspire to be the overcomers who participate in the best resurrection and over whom the second death has no authority.</p>
<p>Verse 6 also says that the overcomers &ldquo;will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.&rdquo; The overcomers will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium (2:26-27; 12:5). As priests they will bring man in his need to God and minister God to man, and as kings they will bring God in His authority to man and represent God to shepherd man. This is a reward to them. The believers who are defeated in this age will forfeit this reward. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the millennium, they will participate in the service of God and in the kingship in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity (22:3, 5).</p>
<p>Today the proper Christians bring man and man&rsquo;s need to God and Christ, and they also minister God and Christ to man. Also, they bring God&rsquo;s authority to man and represent God to man. As we share in the upper section of the millennium, we will be both priests and kings. We will meet the need of both God and man, bringing man to God and God to man. Through our priesthood and kingship both God and man will be fully satisfied. We will be a priestly and kingly people, a people far beyond anything of the second death. The overcomers will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium. In this realm, there will be no weakness, no sickness, no trouble, and no hardship. Christ&rsquo;s kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers. How wonderful this will be!</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>

<h2 class="head3">15. The Husband of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In Revelation 21:2&mdash;22:5 Christ is revealed as the universal and eternal Husband of the New Jerusalem, the universal and eternal wife. This is the last item of Christ unveiled in Revelation.</p>
<p>The main content of the New Testament is that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself in His life and nature into His chosen and redeemed people, thereby making them His duplication so that they may express Him; this corporate expression will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Eph. 3:9; 1:9-23). The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the Bible, involves God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead (Rev. 21:2; 3:12). In Christ, God has become man to make man God in His life and in His nature so that the redeeming God and the redeemed man can be mingled, constituted, together to be one entity&mdash;the New Jerusalem (21:3, 22). Eventually, the triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us, and we also become the New Jerusalem through the process of God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Rom. 5:10). The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of God with man, divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</p>
<p>The issue of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching is just one entity, the New Jerusalem, as the aggregate of all the God-men (Rev. 21:7; Heb. 2:10-11; 12:22). God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make the believers God-men for the constitution of the Body of Christ so that the New Jerusalem may be consummated as the eternal enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God (Gal. 3:26; 4:7, 26, 31). The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God (John 17:22-23a; Eph. 4:4-6).</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a composition of divinity and humanity mingled, blended, and built up together as one entity (John 14:20, 23; Rev. 21:2-3, 9-23). All the components have the same life, nature, and constitution and thus are a corporate person. God and man, man and God, are built up together by being blended and mingled together (John 14:20, 23; 15:4a; 1 Cor. 6:17). This is a matter of God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a composition of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified people who have been deified (John 3:6; Heb. 2:11; Rom. 12:2; 8:29-30). For us to be deified means that we are being constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity (Rev. 21:11). The New Jerusalem is built by God&rsquo;s constituting Himself into man to make man the same as God in life, nature, and constitution so that God and man may become a corporate entity. The New Jerusalem is God Himself enlarged with His redeemed by the way of constituting, uniting, and mingling (John 3:29a, 30a; 14:20; 15:4a; 1 Cor. 6:17). Thus, the deification of the believers is a process that will consummate in the New Jerusalem. On God&rsquo;s side, the Triune God has been incarnated to be a man; on our side, we are being deified, constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity. This is the highest truth and the highest gospel (Rev. 3:12).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Husband for the Prepared Bride</h2>
<p>The subject of the Bible is a divine romance of a universal couple; the male is God Himself, and the female is God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people (Gen. 2:21-24; Isa. 54:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:14; 31:32; Ezek. 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19; Matt. 9:15; John 3:29). In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) and a dwelling place for Himself (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The spouse is for His satisfaction in love. As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s betrothal and marriage life cover the church age, the kingdom age, and the eternal age. In the church age we are betrothed to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). The wedding day will be the age of the millennial kingdom (Rev. 19:7). The marriage life will be in the New Jerusalem for eternity (21:2, 9-10).</p>
<p>According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the human wife (with the divine life and nature) of the Lamb, the redeeming God (vv. 2, 9). This human wife can marry a divine person because she has the divine life and nature. This qualifies her to match the redeeming God. On the one hand, she is human; on the other hand, she is divine. Because she is human, she can be the redeeming God&rsquo;s human wife. Because she is divine, she can marry Him, a divine person.</p>
<p>According to its divinity, the New Jerusalem is the divine Husband (the redeeming God in His consummated embodiment, Christ, with the human life and nature) of God&rsquo;s redeemed elect. The wife is human, and the Husband is divine. A human wife can marry a divine person because she has the divine person&rsquo;s nature and life. The same entity can be both a husband and a wife because the New Jerusalem is divine. The divine God is a part of its constituent. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a wife; on the other hand, it is a husband. The New Jerusalem is the wife according to its humanity and the Husband according to its divinity. But as the divine Husband, the New Jerusalem has the human life and nature. In its humanity and in its divinity it is a couple, a wife and a husband.</p>
<p>The holy city is a corporate person, and this corporate person is a couple&mdash;the processed Triune God married to the transformed, tripartite man. This is the Spirit and the bride becoming one (22:17). Divinity and humanity are married together, mingled together, to be one entity. The holy city is a corporate person&mdash;a great, corporate God-man. The New Jerusalem is a couple with the Husband and the bride, the wife. The Husband is the wife, and the wife is the Husband because they coinhere. This is God&rsquo;s eternal economy: to incorporate Himself with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect, to be one universal, divine, mystical incorporation, which is the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity. The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride (21:2, 9-10). The consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God and the consummation of His regenerated, transformed, and glorified people will be a universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity (vv. 11, 23).</p>
<p>Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; Christ is a person, and He will marry the New Jerusalem. It is impossible for Christ to marry a physical city as His wife. This is a strong proof that the New Jerusalem is not a physical city. Here, to be adorned is to make oneself pretty. This term can be applied only to females. Only females need adornment. The New Jerusalem as the bride of Christ needs to be not only consummated but also adorned (v. 19). Today we need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit as its wall of precious stones. The New Jerusalem is adorned with pure gold, pearl, and precious stones, that is, with the Triune God as the elements. This is the consummated Divine Trinity constituting Himself into our being to make us gold, pearl, and precious stones so that He may have an enlargement for His eternal expression, the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Similarly, Song of Songs 1:10-11 reveals that Christ&rsquo;s lover is transformed with the Triune God&rsquo;s attributes by the remaking Spirit in coordination with the lover&rsquo;s companions, the gifted members in the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). The seeker&rsquo;s hair being bound into plaits of gold indicates her submission to God through the transformation of the Spirit with God the Father in His divine nature. The plaits of gold are fastened with studs of silver, signifying Christ the Son in His all-inclusive judicial redemption. The strings of jewels on the seeker&rsquo;s neck signify God the Spirit in His transforming work to become her obedience to God&rsquo;s will. Perfecting others with gold, silver, and precious stones in Song of Songs 1:10-11 corresponds to building the church with gold, silver, and precious stones in 1 Corinthians 3:10-12. Eventually, what is built at the end of the Bible will be a city of gold, precious stones, and pearls to replace silver. The entire Bible speaks the same thing concerning God&rsquo;s economy to produce the church as the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem. If we want what we do to be in the New Jerusalem, we need to learn how to add gold into the plaits of hair, how to make silver studs to hold the plaits of hair, and how to make strings of jewels, precious stones, to cover the naked neck. In other words, we need to learn to build with gold, silver, and precious stones. We must learn to minister the Triune God in a practical way to others for their transformation.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Holy City, Jerusalem&mdash;<br />
the Aggregate of All the Saints&mdash;<br />
Being the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:9-10 says, &ldquo;One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; Christ will be the Husband, and the holy city, Jerusalem&mdash;the aggregate of all the saints&mdash;will be the bride, the wife of the Lamb. This will be the universal couple living a universal married life for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Holy City</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the holy city (vv. 2, 10). As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God&rsquo;s holy nature to be His habitation. Thus, the holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</p>
<p>Holiness is the nature of God. Love reveals God&rsquo;s heart, righteousness is God&rsquo;s way, and holiness is God&rsquo;s nature. Only God Himself is holy (15:4), for only God is separated and uniquely different from everything else. The New Jerusalem is a city that is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore, it is absolutely holy. It is entirely different from all other things. Whenever we experience the mingling of God with us today, there is a real separation, a real holiness. In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that thing. Holiness signifies a separation from common things. The more we are mingled with God in Christ, the more we will be holy. We will be different and separated from all things common. To be holy means to have something of God mingled with us. Holiness is not a matter of action but a matter of nature; it is not a matter of what we do but of how much we have been mingled with God. An aloofness from everything is not holiness. Holiness is determined by how much we have experienced being mingled with God. Hebrews 12 says that God disciplines us that we might partake of His holiness (v. 10). This means that He disciplines us that we may partake of His nature by being mingled with Him. The New Jerusalem is absolutely and thoroughly mingled with God; therefore, it is the holy city.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the word holy does not only mean separated unto God but also saturated with God. In the Old Testament to be made holy is to be separated unto God. There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional. In the New Testament, though, we see both the objective, positional holiness and sanctification and the subjective, dispositional holiness and sanctification. Romans 6:19 and 22 indicate that sanctification is something subjective and dispositional. In the Old Testament a piece of gold could be made holy and sanctified by changing its position, by placing it in the temple. Yet the church today is made holy not only positionally but also dispositionally. Eventually, both the positional sanctification in the judicial aspect and the dispositional sanctification in the organic aspect of God&rsquo;s complete salvation will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the holy city (Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19).</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul prays that our whole being, spirit and soul and body, may be sanctified wholly. This is dispositional sanctification in which the holy God is saturating us with His holy nature. In positional sanctification there is only a change of position, but in dispositional sanctification there is the transformation in nature and in element. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is holy not merely in the sense of the Old Testament but also in the sense of the New Testament. Based upon this principle, we can see that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, could never be a physical city since a physical city could never be saturated with God. This city is composed with living persons who can be and who are saturated with God. In the old Jerusalem and in the old temple we can see the separation but not the saturation with God. In the New Testament, however, the church is God&rsquo;s temple (1 Cor. 3:16), and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God. The New Jerusalem is not the Old Testament city but the New Testament city&mdash;a city saturated with God.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is called the holy city because gold, which signifies God&rsquo;s holy nature, is the site of the New Jerusalem. In the whole universe, only God is holy in nature. The New Jerusalem is built on gold. The city proper of the New Jerusalem is gold, and its street is gold (Rev. 21:18, 21). On this gold the foundations are laid and the gates and wall are built.</p>
<p>God sanctifies us so that we may be established in His holy nature. God&rsquo;s sanctifying us is a very important and particular item in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. Not only is God Himself holy, but He also wants to make us holy. Eventually, He wants to make us the holy city, New Jerusalem. In the universe God is holiness; whenever people touch God, they touch holiness (cf. Isa. 6:2-3; Rev. 4:8). Hence, in His organic salvation God&rsquo;s intention is to constitute us with His holy nature so that we may become the Body of Christ and ultimately be manifested as an established holy city, New Jerusalem. Since all the believers will be the components of the holy city, all of them should be sanctified to be as holy as the holy city. Unless we are made holy, we will not be qualified to be a part of the New Jerusalem. As the holy city, the New Jerusalem is composed of holy believers.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The title <em>Jerusalem</em> is composed of two Hebrew words&mdash;<em>Jeru</em> meaning &ldquo;foundation,&rdquo; and <em>Salem</em> meaning &ldquo;peace.&rdquo; Paul tells us in Hebrews 7 that the king of Salem is the king of peace (v. 2). <em>Salem</em> is peace, and <em>Jeru</em> is that which is founded, built, and laid as a foundation. Thus, <em>Jerusalem</em> means the foundation of peace. Jerusalem is that which is grounded, founded, and safeguarded in peace. The Bible indicates that peace is God Himself. In the New Testament there are two titles&mdash;<em>the God of peace</em> (Phil. 4:9; 1 Thes. 5:23) and <em>the peace of God</em> (Phil. 4:7). Both of these titles indicate that God Himself is our peace. Also, Ephesians 2:14 indicates that Christ Himself is our peace. This peace is God into whom we have been grounded. This is not an outward peace but an inward peace in which we are safeguarded. In eternity we will enjoy this peace.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus told us, &ldquo;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you&rdquo; (John 14:27). Our Lord also said in John 16:33, &ldquo;These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.&rdquo; Since the Lord has given us His peace, today we should live in His peace. Actually, the Lord Himself is still here as our peace. Jerusalem is the Triune God to be our peace, to be our safety. The entire New Jerusalem will be an entity of peace. The New Jerusalem will be solidly grounded and safeguarded in the Triune God as peace and safety, and we will enjoy the Triune God as peace forever.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Aggregate of All the Saints</h2>
<p>Since the New Jerusalem is the bride, we should not consider her as a material city. Christ will marry only something living. The bride will be composed of all the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints of God. In the New Jerusalem there will be no wood, bricks, or dust. Instead, there will be gold, pearl, and transformed precious stones.</p>
<p>The fact that the New Jerusalem is such a living composition means that it is a living building. The thought that God&rsquo;s people are a living building is not first found in the book of Revelation. In the Old Testament we see that God&rsquo;s people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place.</p>
<p>The Bible covers two main things&mdash;God&rsquo;s creation and God&rsquo;s building. In the beginning of the Bible we have creation, and at the end we have the building. Between these two ends we have God&rsquo;s building work. In creation God produced the building materials. As He carries on His building work, He fits all these materials together into one unit, which is His building.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 we have a garden created, and in Revelation 21 we have a city constructed. A garden is something natural, created by God, but a city is something built up by Him. The New Jerusalem is not a natural garden but a built-up city. In the garden in Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions (vv. 8-10). By the flow of this river we have gold, bdellium, and onyx, a precious stone. Bdellium here is a resin secreted by a tree that hardens to form a pearl-like substance. The first mention of stone in the Bible is not of ordinary, common stone but of onyx, a type of precious stone.</p>
<p>According to the record of Genesis 28, Jacob, a supplanter, had a divine dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven. When he awoke from his sleep, he called the name of that place the house of God (v. 17). Then he took the stone he had used for a pillow, set it up as a pillar, anointed it with oil, and called it Bethel, meaning the house of God (vv. 18-19, 22).</p>
<p>According to Exodus 28, twelve precious stones were set on the breastplate of the high priest (vv. 15-21), the first of which was sardius and the last of which was jasper. Included among these twelve stones was onyx. This indicates that the breastplate of the high priest is related to both Genesis 2 and Revelation 21, for in Genesis 2 we have onyx, and in Revelation 21 we have jasper. In the description of the breastplate of the high priest and of the two onyx stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel (Exo. 28:9-12), we see a miniature of God&rsquo;s building. The precious stones of both the breastplate and the shoulder pieces bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. This signifies that the redeemed Israelites are for God&rsquo;s building. The twelve precious stones on the breastplate were set in gold. The gold base held all the precious stones. Certainly this is a picture of God&rsquo;s building. This breastplate was a type of the building that expressed God.</p>
<p>John 1 tells us that when Peter first met the Lord Jesus, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (v. 42). After Peter received the revelation that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are a stone, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18, lit.). In this one verse we have the stone and the rock. Later, in his first Epistle, Peter says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house&rdquo; (2:4-5). Therefore, the concept that the believers are stones to be built up for God&rsquo;s habitation is not new in the book of Revelation. It is found elsewhere in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</p>
<p>If we put together all the portions of the Word concerning the stone, we will see that precious stones signify God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. All the stones with which the New Jerusalem is built are God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints. The apostle Peter tells us clearly that we are living stones. Now we are in the process of transformation and of being built into God&rsquo;s building. First, God transforms us; then He builds us. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is not a pile of material; it is a composition of material that has been built up. The entire city of New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s building, the living composition of all God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints.</p><h2 class="head5">4) The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:9 speaks of the bride and the wife. The bride is mainly for the wedding day, whereas the wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day (2 Pet. 3:8) and the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The bride in the kingdom age will include the overcomers (Rev. 3:12; 19:7-9), but the wife in eternity will include all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones (21:9).</p>
<p>The whole Bible speaks concerning the bride and the wife. The first wife in the whole universe was Eve. In Ezekiel 23 the children of Israel are referred to as the wife of Jehovah (vv. 1-4). In John 3 all the regenerated believers are the bride of Christ to be His increase, His enlargement (vv. 29-30). In Ephesians 5 the church is the wife of Christ, and in 2 Corinthians 11:2 the believers have been engaged, or betrothed, to Christ as their Husband. In Revelation 19:7-9 there is a universal wedding day, the marriage of the Lamb. Finally, in the last two chapters of the Bible there is the wife of the Lamb. Revelation 21:2 tells us that the New Jerusalem is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, and verse 9 refers to the New Jerusalem as the bride, the wife of the Lamb. The Lamb is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the wife is the consummation of all the saints.</p>
<p>The wife of the Lamb is one with her Redeemer, as Eve was taken out of Adam and attached back to him to be one flesh, two as one in one nature and one life (Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:25-27, 29-32). Eve was originally a piece of bone, a rib, taken out of Adam. This bone was built into a woman, a wife for Adam, and attached back to Adam to be one flesh. These two, Adam and Eve, were as one in one nature and one life. A wife is one nature and one life with her husband. A physical, material city could never be one with Christ in one life and in one nature. The New Jerusalem is not only something with the divine element added to it and with the holy nature wrought into it, but it is also one with the Redeemer in one nature and in one life.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 23:1-4 we see that the old Jerusalem symbolized the children of Israel as the wife of Jehovah. In these verses Ezekiel speaks concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. In this passage, Jerusalem does not denote a physical city but the people represented by the city, a living people who were a wife to Jehovah.</p>
<p>The divine romance is portrayed poetically in Song of Songs. In Song of Songs the seeker passes through a process to become the Shulammite, the duplication of Solomon and a figure of the New Jerusalem (6:13, 4). The lover&rsquo;s name, <em>Shulammite,</em> which is the feminine form of <em>Solomon,</em> is first used in Song of Songs 6:13, indicating that at this point she has become Solomon&rsquo;s duplication and counterpart, the same as Solomon in life, nature, and image, as Eve to Adam (Gen. 2:20-23). This signifies that the lover of Christ becomes the same as He is in life, nature, and image to match Him (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29) for their marriage. The lover of Solomon, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become Solomon&rsquo;s duplication. The New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, including all of God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the redeeming God (signified by Solomon) and all His redeemed (signified by the Shulammite) become one. The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed and consummated Triune God in human virtues. Christ and His wife will be joined together to be the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s expression; this is the consummated Shulammite. The New Jerusalem is the real and consummate Shulammite.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we will be conformed to be the wonderful Shulammite, who, as the duplication of Solomon, is the greatest and ultimate figure of the New Jerusalem as the counterpart of Christ. Just as King Solomon became a country man to court a country girl in order to make her his queen, his duplication, God in Christ became a man to court man in order to make man God in life, nature, expression, and function but not in the Godhead, to be Christ&rsquo;s bride (Matt. 9:15; Rev. 19:7; cf. Psa. 45:1-3, 9, 13-14). The Bible reveals that God became a man to court us and that now He wants us to court Him by our becoming divine for His expression through our personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual relationship with Him (S. S. 1:1-8; 2 Cor. 2:10; Exo. 33:11; Rom. 8:4, 6; 1 Cor. 2:15). The Shulammite is a figure of us as the reproduction of Christ, who is the embodiment of God. Thus, the many lovers of Christ eventually will become duplications of God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is the fulfillment of God becoming a man that man might become God, which is the high peak of the divine revelation. The corporate overcomer, the Shulammite, who is the duplication of Solomon, is a figure of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Shulammite was a country girl. Now, as a counterpart of Solomon, she has become the same as Solomon in life, nature, expression, and function for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. We become the same as God and Christ in life, nature, expression, and function, but not in the Godhead. To say that we are the same as God in His Godhead is a great blasphemy, but to say that we cannot be the same as God in life, nature, expression, and function is unbelief. The Bible tells us again and again that God wants to be one with us and to make us one with Him. This is God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>The phrases <em>in Christ</em> and <em>in the Lord</em> are used repeatedly in the New Testament. Paul tells us to rejoice always in the Lord (Phil. 4:4). In ourselves we cannot rejoice. We can only sigh. But in the Lord we are able to do all things (v. 13). Surely our God is able to make us the same as He is in His life, in His nature, in His expression, and in His function to carry out His economy. This signifies that in the maturity of Christ&rsquo;s life, the overcomers, who were once sinners, have become the same as Christ in life, nature, expression, and function for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>The almighty King, the almighty &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; wants to be one with His people, signified by a country girl. He does this not by coercing but by the personal and affectionate way of courting. The Bible ends with a couple in a marriage life&mdash;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21). We are involved in this divine romance, and we are participating in this wonderful conclusion of the entire Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>John 3 reveals that all the regenerated believers constitute the bride of their Redeemer as His increase, His enlargement (vv. 3, 5-6, 14, 29-30). Many believed in the Lord Jesus by the time of John 3. They had been regenerated and had received the eternal life. As a result, the disciples of John the Baptist became jealous and told him that all were coming to Jesus (v. 26). John then told his disciples that He who has the bride is the Bridegroom, and he indicated that everyone who was regenerated should go to Him since He was the Bridegroom. This indicates that all the regenerated believers are composed together to be the bride to match the Bridegroom as His increase. Following this John said, &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (v. 30). The increase in John 3:30, however, is the bride in verse 29, who is a living composition of all the regenerated people. All the believers regenerated by the Triune God should be attached to Him as the Bridegroom. The believers should not have been detached from their Bridegroom to form a religion, taking John as the head. John had to be put into prison; otherwise, there would have been two bridegrooms&mdash;Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. Since John the Baptist had carried out his ministry to introduce Jesus Christ, it was necessary that he must decrease. All the regenerated ones should not have come to John to attach themselves to him. They all needed to go and attach themselves to Jesus, the Bridegroom.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; The <em>you</em> in this verse is corporate. Many saints have been betrothed to Christ as one corporate virgin. There is one church with many members, and Paul betrothed the believers in a corporate way as one corporate virgin to one Husband&mdash;Christ.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb is also the consummation of the church as the wife in Ephesians 5:25-27 and 29-32. The church in Ephesians 5 is the wife in the stage of development, and the New Jerusalem will be the consummated bride. The bride in Revelation 21 can never be improved; she will live forever, but she will not grow. The wife in Ephesians 5, however, is still growing. The church in Ephesians 5 still has wrinkles and spots, but the bride in Revelation 21 has no wrinkles or spots. The New Jerusalem is the consummation of the wife in Ephesians 5. The Lord is still working in the church to cause her to grow.</p>
<p>The wife of the Lamb as symbolized by the universal and heavenly woman in Revelation 12:1-6 and 13-17 is composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints. According to Revelation 12:1, this woman is &ldquo;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&rdquo; This universal and heavenly woman is the total composition of God&rsquo;s people on earth. The sun signifies God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age (Luke 1:78), the moon signifies God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament time, and the stars signify the patriarchs (Gen. 37:9). This universal and heavenly woman in Revelation 12 is the wife of the Lamb. This woman is a universal composition of all the saints, and this woman consummates in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The millennium will be the wedding day in which the overcoming saints will participate (19:7-9). To the Lord a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8); hence, the millennium will be the wedding day of the Lamb with the church as His bride. A wife is a bride for one day, but after the wedding day she is no longer the bride. The millennium of one thousand years will be one day for the Lamb to marry His bride. In the new heaven and new earth all the saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament will be the New Jerusalem, enjoying the divine married life with the Triune God for eternity.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">c. His Twelve Apostles Being the Twelve Foundations<br />
of the Wall of the City</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:14 says, &ldquo;The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s twelve apostles will be the twelve foundations of the wall of the holy city, the universal wife of Christ. This indicates that the apostles are the foremost servants of God.</p>
<p>The apostles represent all the saints in the church; they are the representatives of the church. Hence, whenever the New Testament speaks of the apostles, the church is implied, for the apostles represent the church. This principle will still be in effect in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Verse 12 says that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem there are names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. This indicates that this city includes all the redeemed saints of Israel in the Old Testament times. Verse 14 says that the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. This proves that this city also includes the New Testament believers, who are represented by the twelve apostles. On the gates are the names of the twelve tribes, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles. Putting these names together, it is clear that this city is a composition of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament and the believers of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Luke 13:28-29 tells us that in the coming kingdom of God, there will be not only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other Old Testament saints but also believers who will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south. Many New Testament believers and Old Testament saints will be together in the kingdom. Hebrews 11:8-10, 13, and 16 tell us that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the other Old Testament saints eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, which is the New Jerusalem. According to these verses, it seems that the New Jerusalem will be only for the Old Testament saints. However, verses 39 and 40 tell us that the saints in the Old Testament times could not obtain the promise of the city apart from us, the New Testament believers. Hebrews 11, therefore, corresponds with Revelation 21, showing us that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of both the Old Testament saints and New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of the Old Testament saints, represented by the twelve tribes (Rev. 21:12), and the New Testament saints, represented by the twelve apostles (v. 14). The Old Testament is a history of the twelve tribes, and the New Testament is a history of the twelve apostles. Therefore, these twenty-four names indicate that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the history of the twelve tribes and of the history of the twelve apostles. In other words, if we would understand the significance of the twelve names of the twelve tribes, we need to understand the entire Old Testament. Also, if we would understand the significance of the twelve apostles, we need to understand the entire New Testament. These twenty-four names are a part of the ultimate consummation of the things in the Bible.</p>
<p>The New Testament believers are not for the gates; they are for the wall. The gates are for propagation and entrance, but the wall is for separation, protection, and expression. First, the wall sanctifies all the things belonging to God. God would not let any of His things be mixed up with the things which are not of Him, so there is the need of separation. The New Jerusalem&rsquo;s wall functions to separate the New Jerusalem unto God as something holy. This is why it is called the holy city.</p>
<p>Second, the wall protects. In ancient times cities had walls around them for protection. The wall of the holy city protects the interest of the riches of God&rsquo;s divinity and the attainments of Christ&rsquo;s consummation.</p>
<p>The third function of the wall is to express God. God&rsquo;s appearance is like jasper, and the light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper; hence, the whole city will express God. God the Father is the gold as the base, God the Son is the gates to bring people in, and God the Spirit transforms people to express God. The base of gold is something within, but the wall can be seen. This wall is in the color of the stone that signifies God, that is, jasper. Revelation 21:11 reveals that the city&rsquo;s glory is like the glory of jasper. That is God&rsquo;s appearance (4:3). Today the function of the Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem, is to express Christ.</p>
<p>The names of the twelve apostles are inscribed on the twelve foundations (21:14). The twelve names of the twelve tribes being inscribed on the twelve gates of the city indicates that the twelve gates are there to fulfill the requirement of the law and to satisfy the law&rsquo;s demand upon sinners. The twelve foundations bearing the twelve names of the apostles, who are the representatives of the grace of the New Testament, signify that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God according to the New Testament. The entrance of the city answers the requirements of the Old Testament law, and the foundations of the city show us the grace of the New Testament. The law is for the entry, and the grace is for the foundation. We enter into the New Jerusalem according to the requirement of the law, and we are in the New Jerusalem according to and based on the grace of the New Testament. The twelve apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God. The entrance to the holy city is according to the law of God, and the city is built upon the grace of God. The twelve tribes of Israel represent the law of the Old Testament, whereas the twelve apostles of the Lamb represent the apostles&rsquo; teaching of the New Testament. The gates of the New Jerusalem are the initial section of the building, and the wall is the consummated section. The twelve foundations of the wall, built with every precious stone (vv. 19-20), bear the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14b). This indicates that the New Jerusalem, this precious organic building, is built according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching of the New Testament and that the New Testament believers are the main constituents of this organic building to be the consummated section of this building for the building of its main structure in order that the saints could be built together as God&rsquo;s eternal enlargement and expression.</p>
<p>The apostles are the foundations of this city. Therefore, today we need to read the biographies, the experiences of life, and the teachings of the apostles. We must take the apostles as the foundation. Whether in our personal life or in the services of the church, the wall, the boundary, cannot be according to our discernment or view. Neither can it be according to public opinion or the ideology of this age. It must be according to the lives and teachings of the apostles. They are the foundation of everything, a foundation which cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>That the wall is built upon the foundations of the apostles of the Lamb also means that the wall is built upon the Christ who is brought to us by the apostles. The apostles of the Lamb are the bearers of Christ. They are the transformed transmitting agents of Christ. This simply means that the wall is built upon the Christ who is brought to us through the apostles as the transmitting agents. The children of Israel are the entrances, but the apostles of the Lamb are the foundations because they have Christ, and they brought Christ to us. This is a picture of the church. The church is built upon nothing other than the Christ brought and taught to us by the apostles.</p>
<p>The foundations of the New Jerusalem are not the foundation mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:10-11, which is Christ. Rather, they are the twelve apostles of the Lamb. Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). This means that their teaching and their speaking concerning Christ laid a foundation. Since in eternity there will be no further need for the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles. When we enter into the new heaven and the new earth, all the four dispensations will have been completed, and there will be no need for prophecy. Everything will have been accomplished and fulfilled, and all the apostles will abide forever. The apostles will abide through eternity because they represent the testimony, mercy, grace, and faithfulness of God, and they have become the precious stones.</p><h2 class="head5">1) The Testimony of God</h2>
<p>The apostles signify that the New Jerusalem, which is the building of God and the testimony of Jesus, is not of man but of God (Gal. 1:10-12). None of the apostles are of man; all are of God. This is the real testimony, and we must apply this principle to ourselves. In the church life everything must be of God; there must not be anything of man. The foundation of the church life must be only of God. If there is any human element, sooner or later that will be a weak point and will be heavily attacked by the enemy. Such an element cannot withstand the enemy&rsquo;s attack. If we initiate anything that is of man rather than completely of God, the foundation will not be strong. In every city we must allow the church life to be initiated only of God and not of ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) The Mercy of God</h2>
<p>The apostles are also the real witnesses of God&rsquo;s mercy. When we consider the twelve foundations, we must recognize the mercy of God. If God loves us and gives us a gift when we are in a pitiful state and unworthy of love, this is an act of mercy. Mercy is more far-reaching than grace. God is not only a God of grace but also a God of mercy. If we were worthy of God&rsquo;s love and gift, we would qualify for God&rsquo;s grace. But we are in a truly pitiful state. Therefore, we should praise God that His mercy is so far-reaching that it has reached poor sinners like us.</p>
<p>We need to look closely at the twelve foundation stones. When we study the four Gospels, we see that although Peter was poor and pitiful, he was nevertheless chosen and used by the Lord. He was adorned and equipped by mercy, and his name is on one of the foundations of the city. After the adornment of God&rsquo;s mercy, Peter became qualified for God&rsquo;s grace. If we are humble, we will realize how truly pitiful we are before the Lord and how worthless we are in His eyes. We need His mercy. But after we receive His mercy, we can praise Him and tell Him that now we qualify for His grace. It has nothing to do with our qualifications&mdash;it is all the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>Peter was a poor fisherman (Matt. 4:18-19), and Matthew was a tax gatherer (9:9; Luke 5:27). In those days the Jews scorned tax gatherers, men who collected taxes for Caesar and the Roman Empire, not for the temple of God. They were despised and hated by their own countrymen; hence, they were pitiful people. Yet one of them became an apostle and eventually one of the twelve foundations of the glorious city of God. What a mercy! These twelve foundation stones will eternally declare God&rsquo;s mercy. We all must know the mercy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Grace of God</h2>
<p>The twelve foundation stones are also a witness of God&rsquo;s grace. The grace of God is nothing less than God Himself. God gives Himself to us as our enjoyment to meet all our needs. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says that it is no longer he who lives but Christ who lives within him. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 he declares, &ldquo;Yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; By putting these two verses together, we see that grace is nothing less than Christ Himself. Grace is God in Christ as our strength, our power, and our enjoyment. A poor fisherman like Peter and a tax collector like Matthew could become such important parts of the foundation of the holy city not only because of God&rsquo;s mercy but also because of His grace.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Faithfulness of God</h2>
<p>The colors of the twelve precious stones of the foundation, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first stone is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish-green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, and the eleventh and twelfth are purple. The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors give the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17). Because the foundation of the city is built upon the faithfulness with which God keeps His covenant, it is trustworthy and reliable. The wall with its foundations guarantees God&rsquo;s unfailing faithfulness for eternal security. The New Jerusalem standing upon the twelve layers of its foundations in the colors of the rainbow guarantees God&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p>
<p>It is through God&rsquo;s faithfulness that the apostles have become the city&rsquo;s foundation stones. In the Scriptures the rainbow is a sign of God&rsquo;s faithfulness. God&rsquo;s faithfulness encircles His throne (Rev. 4:3). In the holy city the foundation is not laid block by block but layer upon layer, and each of the twelve layers is a different kind of precious stone. Every layer displays a special color. The layer upon layer of precious stones, which compose the foundation of the city, show forth the colors of the rainbow. This indicates that the faithfulness of God is the foundation of the city. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all looked for &ldquo;the city which has the foundations&rdquo; (Heb. 11:10). They looked for such a city because that city is built upon the faithfulness of God. Psalm 89:2 says that the faithfulness of God is established in the heavens. Strictly speaking, the twelve stones alone do not compose the foundations of this holy city; rather, the faithfulness of God bestowed upon the twelve stones makes up the foundations. The apostles themselves are not sufficient to constitute the foundation. We would not have any trust in Peter and Matthew by themselves, but we realize that the faithfulness of God is with them, and we trust the faithfulness of God upon them. These twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation appear as a rainbow, eternally declaring God&rsquo;s faithfulness. God&rsquo;s faithfulness is based on His righteousness. If there were no righteousness, there would be no faithfulness. Thus, the foundation of the New Jerusalem is the righteousness of God with God&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p>
<p>According to Genesis 9:8-17, the rainbow is a sign that reminds us of God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His word. The rainbow surrounding the throne in Revelation 4 is the sign of God&rsquo;s covenant. Therefore, for God to be expressed in the rainbow tells us that God is the covenant-keeping God, the faithful God. That the foundations of the wall have the appearance of a rainbow also tells us that this city, which is built upon the faithfulness of God, can never be destroyed. Man cannot destroy it; even God Himself cannot destroy it. God has to keep the covenant signified by the rainbow. Therefore, this city is built upon a foundation that is eternally indestructible.</p><h2 class="head5">5) Precious Stones</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a city of foundations (Heb. 11:10). These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb (Rev. 21:14), each of whom is signified by a precious stone. Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning &ldquo;a stone&rdquo; (John 1:42). Later the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church (Matt. 16:18). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God&rsquo;s eternal building. Every believer needs to be regenerated and transformed so that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God. First, the city proper, with its street, is of pure gold (Rev. 21:18, 21). Gold, the symbol of the nature of God, signifies the Father as the source, from whom the element for the substantial existence of the city is produced. Second, the twelve gates of the city are pearls, which signify the Son&rsquo;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained. Third, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones, signifying the Spirit&rsquo;s work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His all-permeating glory. In the garden of Eden these three kinds of treasures merely existed as materials (Gen. 2:11-12), whereas in the city of New Jerusalem these precious materials become a builded city for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to have a corporate expression.</p>
<p>We all appreciate Peter, John, and the other disciples, but we may not realize how much pressure they experienced. They were no longer clay&mdash;they became precious stones. They were transformed through intense heat and pressure. If we consider the histories of Peter and John, we will see the sufferings through which they passed. They were pressed and burned until they became strong and precious. On the day of Pentecost Peter and John were no longer clay; rather, they had become stones, so strong and precious. Eventually, we must also become precious stones through the transformation work of the Spirit. All the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body must be transformed in order that God may have the foundation and the wall of the holy city.</p>
<p>The twelve foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem with the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb show that the particular characteristics of the twelve apostles remain. The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone (Rev. 21:19). Although the light that shines forth from them is the same expression of God, their colors are different. These different colors are their personalities, and these personalities reflect the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>The mingling of God and man does not mean that our person has been fully annulled. Even though Paul did say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). &ldquo;I&rdquo; is still here; it has not been annulled.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes it is beautiful for Peter to have the element of God within him. However, it would not be beautiful if Peter was annulled and only the element of God remained. Peter&rsquo;s Epistles show that he was not annulled. In reading his Epistles we can immediately recognize that they were written by Peter. The same is true with Paul&rsquo;s and John&rsquo;s Epistles. Peter, Paul, and John were not annulled; their particular characteristics were retained. In the New Jerusalem their characteristics will not be annulled; their names will still be there (Rev. 21:14). Salvation would not be very meaningful if our characteristics were annulled. We must realize that our flavor will be with us even when we enter into the New Jerusalem. Even in the New Jerusalem, we will not lose our personal identity and flavor.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is to mingle Himself with our person. Every apostle had a strong character and was very capable. Yet they all shared one characteristic&mdash;they were mingled with God. We should never think that our personality has been annulled because we are mingled with God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">6) One Building with the One Appearance<br />
of God in Christ</h2>
<p>The wall and its foundations of precious stones signify the transforming and building work of the Holy Spirit. The foundations of the wall of the city are of twelve layers. The number twelve shows the completion in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. The first layer is jasper, indicating that the likeness of God is the predominant appearance. The first layer of the wall&rsquo;s foundation, as well as the entire wall of the New Jerusalem, is built with jasper. This indicates that the main material in the building of the holy city is jasper. Since jasper signifies God expressed in His communicable glory, the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory (v. 11).</p>
<p>We must now consider a very important matter regarding the twelve foundations. Although the entire wall is jasper, the twelve foundations are different stones with various colors. Each layer is different from the others. The reason for this is that the apostles had different ministries. Paul&rsquo;s ministry was different from Peter&rsquo;s, and Peter&rsquo;s was different from John&rsquo;s. However, these twelve foundations are not laid side by side; rather, they are laid one on top of another. The top layer, the layer that met the bottom of the wall, is jasper, the same color as the wall. Thus, all the work of the apostles issued in the same appearance, jasper. All twelve layers lead to and support the unique testimony in the unique expression.</p>
<p>The work of many so-called Christian workers leads to an individualistic appearance. But the work of the apostles led to one appearance. Today&rsquo;s Christian workers not only have different colors, but instead of being one on top of another, they are side by side. Thus, they have an individualistic expression, often striving against one another in competition. The work of the apostles, on the contrary, was layer upon layer and led to the unique appearance of jasper, the appearance of God in Christ.</p>
<p>If we examine the ministries of the apostles in the New Testament, we will see that each ministry was upon the top of another, not side by side. Peter, a fisherman, brought in the fish, the material. Paul, a tent maker, built up the tent with the materials brought in by Peter. Eventually, after the tent had been torn, the apostle John came in to mend it. Thus, Peter&rsquo;s ministry was a fishing ministry, Paul&rsquo;s was a building ministry, and John&rsquo;s was a mending ministry. These three apostles worked one on top of the other. Paul&rsquo;s work was upon Peter&rsquo;s, and John&rsquo;s work was upon Paul&rsquo;s. As a result, they produced one building, not three distinct houses. Unlike Peter, Paul, and John, many of today&rsquo;s Christian workers build up their own houses, each with its own design, shape, color, and expression. Therefore, in Christianity there are thousands of different houses. But in the entire universe there will only be the unique New Jerusalem, built upon the foundation of many ministries laid one on top of the other. May this matter become crystal clear to us.</p>
<p>We must realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery it is absolutely wrong to have another side-by-side work. Our work must be a layer laid upon the present layer, and it must produce the same appearance. We do not believe that the Lord will raise up any side-by-side work. Although there will be different ministries, they will be layer upon layer, and they will lead to the one appearance of God in Christ. No matter how many ministries we may have in the recovery, we will have the same mind, the same concept, and the same opinion, and we will all speak the same thing. However, this does not mean that all the ministries must be the same. We need different ministries, yet they must be layer upon layer. All the ministries must lead to one appearance&mdash;the appearance of today&rsquo;s church and of the coming New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>All the ministries support and bear the same unique testimony. We are for the unique expression of the Triune God, not for any specific practices or particular doctrines. Although our ministries may differ, our expression, our testimony, is just one. We are not building side by side; we are building one on top of another to bring forth the unique testimony of God in the universe.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(27)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Lamb with the Lord God the Almighty<br />
Being the City&rsquo;s Temple</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:22 tells us that &ldquo;the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb&rdquo; are the temple of the holy city. The city is the aggregate of all the saints, and in the city Christ with the Lord God the Almighty will be the temple. This means that the Triune God as the temple is in the city of the New Jerusalem. The city is the aggregate of the saints, and the temple in this city is the Triune God. In other words, the redeemed saints will be the city, and the redeeming Triune God will be the temple in this city.</p>
<p><em>The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb</em> refers to the redeeming Triune God. The Lamb, who is the second of the Trinity, is also the temple. Our God today is the Redeemer as well as the Triune God; hence, the redeeming Triune God is our temple. The fact that the New Jerusalem is a cube of twelve thousand stadia in three dimensions shows the absolute perfection and eternal completeness of our redeeming Triune God, who is the temple and who is the Holy of Holies. With Him there is nothing wrong, and He has no bias, obliqueness, or crookedness.</p>
<p>The designation <em>the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb</em> signifies the many attributes and accomplishments of the Triune God. The temple in Revelation 21:22 is built with the Triune God, with all His attributes plus all His accomplishments. All that He has obtained and attained are the materials for the building up of this wonderful temple that we have today. We are in such a temple built with the Lord, with God, with the Almighty, with the Lamb, and with all His attributes and accomplishments.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Tabernacle and the Temple</h2>
<p>The first mention of the tabernacle is in Exodus. After entering the good land, the children of Israel built a temple, which replaced the tabernacle. Even before the temple was built, in 1 Samuel 3:3 the tabernacle was called the temple. This means that the tabernacle and the temple actually refer to one thing. The former could be taken down and moved from place to place in the wilderness; the latter had a settled location in the good land as a more permanent building.</p>
<p>At first the children of Israel had the tabernacle. Then they entered the good land, conquered the enemy, and secured the peace. Afterward they built the temple. The tabernacle was then merged with the temple (1 Kings 8:4). These two, the tabernacle and the temple, were God&rsquo;s greatest blessing to His people on earth. This is because both were God&rsquo;s home. As long as God&rsquo;s people had the house of God, they could locate God. They could tell others where He was. The tabernacle and the temple were the center and focus of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth was first a single person, Jesus Christ. Jesus was God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling place. Then the church as a corporate person became the temple of God, God&rsquo;s dwelling (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:16). When we enter into eternity, God&rsquo;s dwelling will not change from living persons to a lifeless, physical city. We must believe that these living persons, built together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, will be enlarged and intensified. In the coming age there will be an enlargement of these living persons as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>In the New Testament we see God incarnated. God became flesh. John 1:14 tells us that this incarnated One &ldquo;tabernacled among us.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s particular use of the word <em>tabernacled</em> indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth in the flesh, He was God&rsquo;s tabernacle. In typology the tabernacle built in Exodus was a full type of the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation; the Lord was incarnated to be the embodiment of God on earth. This embodiment was God&rsquo;s dwelling. Colossians 2:9 tells us that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, in Christ with a human, physical body. Christ is the embodiment of God, and this embodiment is the tabernacle of God.</p>
<p>In John 2:19 the Lord told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus&rsquo; physical body was a temple of God (v. 21). In John 1 there is the tabernacle, and in John 2 there is the temple. The Lord&rsquo;s word in three days signifies His resurrection. Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:6 that when Christ was raised, we were resurrected together with Him. Peter says further that through the all-inclusive resurrection we have all been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). We have been born of God and are His sons. This implies that the temple the Lord Jesus built up in three days, that is, in His resurrection, is not a single person but a corporate entity. In the Epistles we are told that the church as the Body of Christ is God&rsquo;s temple. First Corinthians 3:16 says that the saints are the temple of God. The New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the Bible is the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3) and the temple (v. 22).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the temple was in the city of Jerusalem, but in Revelation 21 and 22 the entire city is the tabernacle and the temple. This temple is not only God&rsquo;s dwelling but also the dwelling place of all His serving ones. At that time all the saints will be priests with an eternal priesthood. We will all serve Him (v. 3). Our dwelling place then will also be the temple. The New Jerusalem is a great temple where both God and His redeemed dwell together.</p>
<p>We must believe that our abiding in the Lord and His abiding in us will be intensified, enlarged, and uplifted to the uttermost. This is a strong indication that the city is not a physical place. In this city the temple is a person, and this person is God and the Lamb. The Triune God will be the temple. Since the temple within the city is a divine person, the Triune God Himself, the city also must not be something lifeless but an organic entity composed of persons.</p>
<p>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament are focused on the tabernacle and the temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling. The conclusion of the whole Bible is also the tabernacle and the temple. In the Old Testament the tabernacle typified Christ individually as God&rsquo;s tabernacle, and the temple typified Christ corporately as God&rsquo;s temple. What we have here is Christ and the church. Christ is the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle, and Christ as the Head with the church as His Body together fulfill the type of the temple. This will have a consummation, and this ultimate consummation will be the New Jerusalem, which is both the tabernacle and the temple. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s dwelling, which He has been building for centuries. The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints of the Old Testament, as represented by the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and all the saints of the New Testament, as represented by the names of the twelve apostles. It is a living composition of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to be His eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a dwelling for both God and His serving ones. In the Old Testament the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling, and at the same time it was also the priests&rsquo; dwelling in which they served. Both God and His serving priests dwelt in the same tabernacle. To God the New Jerusalem is His dwelling, and to us God is our dwelling. Therefore, the tabernacle is God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and this God who dwells in the tabernacle is the temple, which is the dwelling place of His serving ones.</p>
<p>Revelation 3:12 says, &ldquo;He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; The point in this verse is crucial&mdash;in the coming temple of God, the pillar is a person. He who overcomes will be made a pillar in the temple of God. We have already seen in 21:22 that John saw no temple in the New Jerusalem because its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. If a pillar in the temple is a person and the temple itself is a person, the New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city composed of physical stones, physical pearls, and physical gold. Since both the pillar and the temple are persons, the city must also be a person.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Mutual Indwelling of God with Man</h2>
<p>The Triune God is our temple, and we are His tabernacle. He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him, and this mutual dwelling is the New Jerusalem, which to God is the tabernacle and to us is the temple. We enjoy a foretaste of this today when we abide in the Lord and the Lord abides in us (John 15:5). John 14:23 says that the Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Son and make an abode, a dwelling place, with him. This dwelling place will be a mutual abode for the Father with the Son and the Son&rsquo;s lover. This mutual abode will be enlarged in eternity to be the New Jerusalem where God will be our dwelling place, and we will be His dwelling place.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle to God and the temple to us indicates a marvelous mingling. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him&mdash;a mutual indwelling. In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling and the temple for our dwelling.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem has two natures, humanity and divinity. According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God among men, the dwelling place of God in His humanity among men on the earth (Rev. 21:3). In the Bible the tabernacle is a human dwelling place. Likewise, the New Jerusalem is a human dwelling place because it is constituted with humanity. John 1:14 says that God was incarnated in the flesh to tabernacle among men. He is God, but He has become a man. He partook of humanity as His nature; hence, He dwells in humanity.</p>
<p>According to its divinity, the New Jerusalem is the temple of God as the dwelling place of His redeemed elect (Rev. 21:22). The holy city is the temple of God because it is divine. It is the temple of God, yet it is the dwelling place of His redeemed. Because this is God&rsquo;s temple, the dweller must be divine. According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle; God dwells in the tabernacle. God can dwell in a human dwelling place because He has become a man. According to the divinity of the New Jerusalem, it is a temple for God&rsquo;s dwelling. If we are only human and not divine, we cannot dwell in the temple. As believers in Christ and children of God, we human beings can dwell in a divine temple because, having the divine life and nature through regeneration, we have been made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. The New Jerusalem is therefore a mutual abode. According to its humanity, it is a human tabernacle, and according to its divinity, it is a divine temple. It is a human dwelling place, but the Dweller is God. God can dwell in a human place because He became a man. In the same way, we human beings can dwell in God&rsquo;s temple because we have been made God. This is the mutual abiding of God and man.</p>
<p>The tabernacle is built mostly with the humanity of God&rsquo;s people to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, whereas the temple is built mostly of divinity to be the dwelling place of God&rsquo;s redeemed. This indicates that God takes us as His dwelling place and gives Himself to us to be our dwelling place. The divine God lives in a human tabernacle, and redeemed man lives in a divine dwelling place. This indicates the mingling of divinity with humanity, in which both humanity and divinity became a mutual abode. Concerning God and His redeemed in the New Jerusalem, a new hymn says, &ldquo;As man yet God they coinhere, / A mutual dwelling place to be.&rdquo; The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God indicates that the redeemed of God are the dwelling place of God, and the redeeming God as the temple indicates that God is the dwelling place for His serving ones.</p>
<p>For eternity the New Jerusalem will be the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s brief word in John 15:4: &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; To abide in the Lord means to take Him as our dwelling, our habitation. When we take the Lord as our dwelling, He abides in us. This abiding is mutual, for we abide in the Lord, and He abides in us. There is no need to wait until the coming New Jerusalem to abide in the Lord and to have Him abide in us. We can testify strongly that many times we know that we are truly in the Lord and that He is actually abiding in us. When we abide in Him, we immediately sense that He is abiding in us. If we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, how I thank You that right now I am abiding in You,&rdquo; we will have the deep sense that He is abiding in us. Wherever we are&mdash;at home, at work, or at school&mdash;we can say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I am abiding in You right now,&rdquo; and something within us will say, &ldquo;And I am abiding in you.&rdquo; This is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem, which will simply be a mutual abiding place for us and for God and the Lamb.</p><h2 class="head5">3) The Temple Being the House (Palace) of God the Father, the King of Kings, and His Many Sons, the Co-kings</h2>
<p>The temple is the house (palace) of God the Father, who is the King of kings, and of His household, His many sons, His royal family, who are the co-kings with the Father to be its reign (Rev. 22:5b). These co-kings are also the priests who serve God (v. 3b). Hence, they are the royal priesthood, the kingly priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p>Because the Dweller and His children will be kings, this temple becomes a palace. Solomon built a temple for God and also a palace for himself separately. These two buildings were separate and divided, but now in the New Jerusalem our temple and our palace are one. God&rsquo;s temple is our palace. All the members of the same divine family live in that temple where they worship God and live as kings, making that living place a palace. The Father is the Father-King, and the children are the children-kings. This is the reigning and ruling royal family. Their dwelling place is not only the place for them to serve God but also a palace for them to live as kings.</p>
<p>There has never been such a family on earth. The Japanese have their emperors, and the British have their kings, but there has never been a situation where every member of a family is a king. We believers in Christ who are washed by the blood and regenerated by the Spirit are the children of God who will eventually become kings (Rev. 22:5). Our Father-King is the unique Father, but He will have millions of co-rulers, or co-regents, because we will all be His co-kings. Romans 5:17 says that by the abundance of grace we can reign in life as a king today. The entire Bible tells us that we, the children of God, eventually will be the children-kings in the King&rsquo;s house. The reign in the holy city will be not only God Himself as the Father-King but also His children as the co-kings with their Father.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Temple Being the Holy of Holies and<br />
the Enlargement of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Greek word for temple in Revelation 21:22, <em>naos,</em> does not denote the whole temple in a common way. Rather, it denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This inner temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb will be the place in which we serve God.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, the measurement of the New Jerusalem is the same in length, breadth, and height. In three dimensions the city measures twelve thousand stadia (v. 16). The principle revealed in the Bible is that a building with three equal dimensions indicates the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was ten cubits in three dimensions. The Holy of Holies in the temple according to 1 Kings 6:20 was also three equal dimensions of twenty cubits. Accordingly, the New Jerusalem, the holy city, must also be the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The entire city of New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies, and God and the Lamb are the temple of this city. If we put these two points together, we will realize that this city is God and the Lamb. Because the whole city is the Holy of Holies and because the inner temple is God and the Lamb, the city itself is God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the whole city is called the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3). Just as a boy is the precursor of a man, so also the tabernacle is the precursor of the temple. Before the temple appears, there is the tabernacle. But when the tabernacle comes into its fullness, it becomes the temple. Therefore, we need to keep three points before us: that the whole city is the Holy of Holies, that the temple is God Himself and the Lamb, and that the whole city is the tabernacle. When we put all these points together, we see that God Himself is the whole city of New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The entire city of New Jerusalem is not only God Himself but also a living composition of all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. On the one hand, God is the entire city; on the other hand, the city is a living composition of the redeemed. Similarly, the church today is Christ, and it is also a composition of all the believers. On the one hand, the church is a composition of all the believers; on the other hand, Christ is both the Head and the Body. Hence, 1 Corinthians 12:12 indicates that Christ is not only the Head but also the Body: &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; The principle is the same in both the church and New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The church is also the enlargement of Christ. Christ Himself is the individual Christ, but the church is the corporate Christ, Christ enlarged and expanded. Therefore, the church is Christ&rsquo;s expansion, His enlargement. In like manner, the New Jerusalem is the enlargement and the expansion of the Triune God. We should desire to dwell in God, even in the enlargement of God. The expansion and the enlargement of God will be our eternal city in which we will dwell for eternity.</p>
<p>When we come to the New Jerusalem, we are told that it is the tabernacle of God. John then says that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. Here we can see that the city is not only the tabernacle but also the temple. As the tabernacle, the city is the wife of the Lamb. As the temple, the city is the enlargement of God Himself and the Lamb.</p><h2 class="head5">5) The Temple Being God Himself<br />
as the Spirit Reaching Us</h2>
<p>In Psalm 90:1 Moses says, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; While Moses was traveling in the wilderness with the children of Israel for forty years, in his deep feeling he was dwelling in God. Moses knew that God Himself is our eternal dwelling place, our eternal habitation. In Deuteronomy 33:27 he says, &ldquo;The God of old is your habitation.&rdquo; Later, Israel, under God&rsquo;s punishment, was scattered among the Gentile nations. In Ezekiel 11:16 God said to Israel that in their dispersion He would be their sanctuary.</p>
<p>Many people feel that we serve God in the sanctuaries, in the chapels, and in the cathedrals. However, the Bible reveals that we serve God in God Himself. We may also say that we serve God in the Spirit. The New Testament shows us that the Spirit is the processed Triune God reaching us. When God in the Son went to the cross to die for our sins and to accomplish redemption, He was the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world (John 1:29). When God reaches us, however, He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Actually, we serve God in God Himself as the Spirit reaching us. When we pray, we pray in God Himself as the Spirit reaching us. The proper prayer and the proper service that we render to God must be in God Himself. If we pray in ourselves, that prayer is not genuine.</p>
<p>When we enter into eternity, we will dwell, serve, worship, and pray in the processed Triune God as the Spirit reaching us. The entire New Jerusalem is a great reaching of God to us. We all need to ask ourselves regarding where we pray and where we are staying while we are worshipping God. When we pray and worship God, we must be in our redeeming, processed God who is reaching us as the Spirit. This means that we must be in the Spirit, praying, worshipping, and enjoying Him.</p>
<p>We should pray in the triune, processed, redeeming God reaching us as the Spirit. Whenever we pray, we should have the deep thought that we are in the Triune God, the processed God, the redeeming God, the God who is now the all-inclusive Spirit reaching us. We should pray to God in God Himself. Whether He answers our prayers or not is secondary. When we pray in this way, we enjoy Him in an excellent way. This kind of prayer makes us ecstatic.</p>
<p>Today we do not have a physical temple, for our temple is our triune, processed, redeeming God reaching us as the Spirit. Such a Spirit is our temple, our &ldquo;floating home&rdquo; that is always with us. We worship and serve God in this temple, and day and night God is our dwelling place.</p>
<p>Even today our God is our temple. It is not reasonable to think that when we enter into eternity we will have another temple. We will not get out of God and enter into another temple. When we enter into eternity, God will be our temple, and this should not be a surprise to us. We should be able to say that while we were living on the earth, we remained in this temple all the time, in our God who is triune, processed, redeeming, and reaching us as the Spirit. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the entire divine revelation, and this is a practical application of God being our temple.</p>
<p>Today we are dwelling in this temple. This is our habitation, this is the place where we serve and worship God, and this is the place where we meet. In the church meetings we need to have the realization that we are actually meeting in the triune, processed, redeeming, and reaching God. In eternity the New Jerusalem will be a consummation of today&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>In John 4 the Lord told us that God is seeking the proper worshippers who worship Him in spirit (v. 23). In Revelation, however, John tells us that the temple in which we worship is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. John 4:24 also tells us that God, whom we worship, is Spirit. This is the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit, and this is our temple. Here in this temple, we worship and dwell with God in our spirit. In our human spirit He dwells in us as His tabernacle, and in the divine Spirit we dwell in Him as our temple. In our spirit we enjoy our triune, processed, redeeming, and reaching God as our habitation. What an enjoyment! We all need to exercise our spirit in order to be accustomed to enjoying God as our temple.</p>
<p>In the past there was a temple in the ancient city of Jerusalem, but in the New Jerusalem there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), for God Himself and Christ are the temple. We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place? The answer is that They are both. They are the temple where the serving ones will dwell and serve. A temple is a place where those who serve God dwell. The dwellers are the dwelling place, and the dwelling place consists of the dwellers. If we would dwell in the church today, we must be built into it; that is, we must become a part of it. This is very subjective and experiential. If we are not built into the New Jerusalem, we will never enter into that city. God is the God whom we serve, but He is also the temple where we serve. This means that we serve God in God, a thought that is exceedingly deep. God and Christ are our temple. We must serve God in God; we must serve Christ in Christ.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a mutual habitation. God dwells in us, and we dwell in God. The church today is a habitation where God may dwell (Eph. 2:22), and God is the home where we may dwell. We have the presence of God and Christ as the temple. We are not simply before God&rsquo;s presence, but we are in His presence. The presence of God and Christ becomes a dwelling place for us. If we would serve God and Christ in the church, we must be surrounded and covered by God and Christ. This is intensely personal, subjective, and experiential. Here we need to consider that the air is within us and that the air is also outside of us. If the air were not in us, we would soon expire, and if we were not in the air, we could not breathe. Likewise, God and Christ are in us, and we are in God and Christ. We may experience this as a reality in our life. One day, in the new heaven and new earth, we will realize this in the fullest way. We will see how much God and Christ are to us. He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him; hence, we will enjoy His presence to the uttermost.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(28)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e.The Lamb Being the City&rsquo;s Lamp<br />
with God as the Light</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:23 says, &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; Christ is the city&rsquo;s lamp with God as the light in Him. Christ, the Lamb, is the lamp, and in Him is God as the light. Here we see the Lamb as the One who holds God within Him as light because the Lamb is the lamp, and God is the light in the lamp. This indicates that Christ as the overcoming Redeemer holds God within Him. This is the ultimate consummation of the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) God as the Light<br />
Being in the Lamb as the Lamp</h2>
<p>Just as light cannot be separated from a lamp, so God can never be separated from Christ. If light is separated from a lamp, the light is no longer present, and if the lamp is separated from the light, it no longer functions, because it does not have light. Hence, light is one with the lamp. Likewise, God is the light, and Christ as the Lamb is the lamp. They cannot be separated; They are two in one.</p>
<p>As the Lamb, Christ is the redeeming One. Without Him as the redeeming One, we can never come to touch, to contact, God as light since we are so sinful and in darkness. Because no one can stand before God in His light, we need redemption; that is, we need the Lamb. It is only by redemption and by the blood that we can come to contact God. First John 1 says that God is light and that when we come to fellowship with Him, we are in the light (vv. 5, 7a). Then when we are in the light, we see how sinful we are; hence, we need the blood of Jesus to cleanse us (v. 7b). We can testify of this from our experience. Whenever we contact God as light, we have the sense that we need redemption, the redeeming blood of the Lord and the Lord as the Lamb. Christ as the Lamb, the redeeming One, is the Mediator between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5). Through Him and in Him we can contact God, and in Him and through Him God can reveal Himself to us. Today God as light is in the Lamb, the redeeming One, and in eternity Christ will still be the Lamb in whom God as light will be experienced by us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lamb is the expression of God. God is the light, and Christ is the lamp. The light needs the light-bearer. We should never separate Christ from God or God from Christ. Actually, God and Christ are one light. God is the content, and Christ is the light-bearer, the expression. This understanding of the Trinity is different from traditional teaching. Revelation 21:23 describes God as the light and Christ the Son as the lamp. As the light is in the lamp to be its content and to be expressed through the lamp, so God the Father is in the Son to be expressed through the Son.</p>
<p>Just as the light is in the lamp and is one body with the lamp, so God is in Christ and is one body with Christ. God is the content of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God. Christ and God are one. In eternity the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illuminate the New Jerusalem with the glory of God, which glory is the expression of the divine light.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the Triune God is not only our light but also our lamp. If we have light without a lamp, the light is not properly formed. We may illustrate this by electricity. Electricity produces light, but the light is in a light bulb. Without a light bulb, the electricity by itself might harm us.</p>
<p>Christ is the lamp, and God within Him is the light. This means that the Triune God is our light, and He is properly formed in His embodiment, the Son. The principle is the same with the lampstand. The lampstand is the form, and within the lampstand there is the burning oil. Moreover, seven lamps are on one lampstand (Exo. 25:37; Zech. 4:2; Rev. 4:5) to express the light, and the lamps contain the light of the lampstand. Today our light is not only Christ but Christ as the lamp with God as the light.</p>
<p>In Revelation the Lamb is the redeeming person, and this Redeemer is the lamp (21:23). The Lamb as the lamp is altogether for expression. All the light bulbs are for expressing the light contained within them. The entire New Jerusalem is under the expression of Christ the person as the lamp. We may liken the lamp to a big bulb which is able to enlighten a city whose breadth, length, and height are vast. Such a large entity has only one lamp, which is Christ. God the Father as the light needs a lamp; without an adequate lamp or bulb, an electrical light will not shine in an enlightening way. In like manner, without Christ the Lamb being the lamp, God could not shine in an enlightening way.</p>
<p>If God did not shine, we would not be able to see His golden, divine nature. But God shines within the redeeming Lamb as the lamp in an enlightening way. The Son, being the Lamb in His person, is the lamp to express all that the Father is as the light and as the source of the divine riches. All the divine riches are embodied in this lamp. We may say that a light bulb is the embodiment of the electrical light, that is, the embodiment of the electrical &ldquo;riches.&rdquo; Because we are under the shining of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches, we can enjoy these riches. The light establishes and confirms us in our experience of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Our Triune God is our lamp, our light, and He shines within us through the lamp. This is our present experience and will be the coming New Jerusalem. The holy city will be the consummation of all that we have experienced for so many years. It will be an intensification and a consummation of our present experience. The New Jerusalem will not be something new to us in eternity future if we are now experiencing it.</p>
<p>Light is the nature of God&rsquo;s outward expression (1 John 1:5). In the New Jerusalem light refers to God Himself who illuminates the entire city for His expression. God as the divine light, the light of life, is contained in the Lamb as the lamp (Rev. 21:23b). Without the redeeming Christ to contain the divine light, the divine light would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; us. With the redeeming Christ as the lamp, however, the divine light does not kill us but rather illumines us. First Timothy 6:16 tells us that God dwells in unapproachable light. In Christ, however, God becomes approachable. Outside of Christ, God&rsquo;s shining is a killing, but inside of Christ, God&rsquo;s shining is an illumining. Because the divine light shines through the Redeemer, this light has become lovable and touchable. Through the Lamb, the redeeming One, God&rsquo;s light becomes an enjoyable shining for His dispensing. Since the day we were saved, we began to enjoy God as the divine light in the redeeming Christ illumining us all the time. Even today we should enjoy God in this way.</p><h2 class="head5">2) No Need for Natural Light or Man-made Light</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:5 says, &ldquo;Night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them.&rdquo; The light of the holy city is the unique, eternal, divine light in which the redeemed elect live and move within the city (21:23, 25). In the whole universe there are only three kinds of light. First, there is the natural light, the sun and the moon, created by God. Then there is the artificial light made by man. Third, there is the real light, the genuine light, which is God Himself. Revelation tells us that in the New Jerusalem we do not need the natural light of the moon and the sun or any artificial light. This is because we have the real light, which is the source of all the light. This light is God who shines within Christ and is diffused over all the nations.</p>
<p>In the ancient times the outer court of the tabernacle was lit by the sun during the day and by the moon at night, and the Holy Place was lit by the lampstand. In the Holy of Holies, however, there was no sun, no moon, and no lampstand. The light in the Holy of Holies was God Himself in His eternal glory. In the same way, the holy city in eternity future will have no need of the sun or of the moon because God Himself will be the light. This indicates that the entire city of the New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies. As we have seen, the measurements of the city in three dimensions also prove that the city is the Holy of Holies. Besides the New Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies in both the tabernacle and the temple is the only structure in the entire Scriptures that is equal in three dimensions. Similarly, the Holy of Holies is the only other place where there is need of no light other than God. This shows that in eternity the holy city will be the Holy of Holies. In the New Jerusalem God Himself in Christ will be everything to us. The Triune God will also be our light to enlighten us. Here we have the intrinsic essence of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The glory of God as the light and the Lamb as the lamp signify that God in Christ is the light of the New Jerusalem in eternity. In the new city there is no need of the sun, the natural light, or any man-made lamp because God Himself will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city. This means that God in Christ is everything in the New Jerusalem. In the presence of the greatest light, all the lesser lights count for nothing. Outside the New Jerusalem there will still be day and night, but inside there will be no night (21:25).</p>
<p>Today we Christians actually have God Himself within Christ as our light. We do not need philosophy, the human-made light, and we do not need ethical teachings, such as those of Confucius. We do not need any kind of religious teaching because we have God Himself within us. We do not need someone to tell us to love our parents, for we have a divine light in us all day long shining within us to let us know that we should honor our parents. We need to realize, however, that Paul tells us to honor our father and mother (Eph. 6:2). If all Christians have God as the light within them, why does the New Testament still teach many things? In Ephesians 5:22 through 6:9 Paul unveils the kind of living needed in ethical relationships. He talks about the relationship between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between slaves and masters. These charges are not given in the first chapter of Ephesians but in the last two chapters. Before giving us this kind of teaching, Paul says in Ephesians 5:14, &ldquo;Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&rdquo; The New Testament first reveals not the teaching but the divine light. Because we are still in the old creation, we may need this teaching. In the New Jerusalem, however, there will be nothing old and no teaching. If we care for the new creation and the inner anointing all the time, there will be no need of teaching. Because we are in the old creation, we may need teaching to remind us to awaken from our sleep.</p>
<p>According to the principle of the new creation, we have God in us as light. In Him there is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5). When we are fellowshipping with God, we do not need any other light. As long as we have Him, He is the light to us, and we do not need any teaching or doctrine. As long as we have the God who is light to us in our fellowship with Him, there is no need of anything else.</p>
<p>Psalm 119:130 says that the opening, or entrance, of God&rsquo;s Word gives light. Day by day we need to enter into the holy Word. Then we will see and be in the light, which is God Himself through His Word. Therefore, we should not realize or do anything according to our natural ability or according to the education we have received. We have God as our unique light to apply to our life.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christians are divided by many kinds of natural and artificial light, but we must be controlled by the unique, genuine, highest light. This light is our redeeming and shining God. We must apply this light to our daily walk. Many of the saints exercise their natural ability too much, even in the church life, and for this reason there are murmurings and reasonings (Phil. 2:14-15). We do not need the natural and the artificial light. For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to walk and live under the divine, redeeming, and shining light through the word of God.</p>
<p>Just as the temple of the holy city is God Himself, the light is also God Himself. Apart from God and the Lamb, there is nothing in this city. In the New Jerusalem God is everything. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Because Christ is the light in the church, it is the same today in the church life.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Light as a Ruling Power</h2>
<p>God in Christ is the center of the New Jerusalem as the divine vessel. We may also say that Christ as the expression of God is the center of this divine corporate vessel. In the picture of the New Jerusalem, the invisible God is likened to light that shines with glory (Rev. 21:11, 23; 22:5). When light shines, it does a work. Light is a ruling power; it rules when it shines. Darkness, on the other hand, brings in confusion and disorderliness without any rule. In order to destroy a government, one must first throw everything in it into darkness. If all the lights in a major city were to go out, the whole city would be in darkness, and there would be robbery, looting, and killing. When the lights come back on, however, there is the ruling and governing, and order is restored.</p>
<p>In the six days of God&rsquo;s creation for restoration, the first thing restored was light (Gen. 1:3). When God divided the light from the darkness, light came in to rule (vv. 4, 16). Where God is, there is light shining, and where God shines, there is the ruling power. If we have the presence of God in the church, we have light, we are in the light of God, we are in God as light, we are under the light of God, and all of us are ruled. All confusion is subdued, and all things are brought into order. If there is confusion among us, it means that we do not have God as light and that we are in darkness. Today the church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. In this smaller New Jerusalem, if we have God as the center in Christ, we have the light, and the first thing light does is rule and keep everything in order.</p>
<p>When light shines, it also generates. Life comes from light. When the light of God shines into us, the life of God comes into us. Light always brings life to us. When we have God as light, we first have order and then life. We can see this in Genesis 1. On the first day when light came in, there was a dividing, and the keeping of order began. Before light came in, everything was in chaos. After light came in, light was divided from darkness, and things began to be kept in order. After this, the waters below were divided from the waters above, and life came out of this order. If there is the light of God, there are the ruling power and order, and if there are the ruling power and order, there is the generating power, the yielding of life. All kinds of lives came out because of the light. This is the picture in the New Jerusalem. God is the ruling center of the New Jerusalem as the shining light. From this light come all the riches of life. God is light, and from Him flows the river of water of life, and in this living water grows the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Enjoyment of God as Light</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will have a particular kind of light&mdash;the redeeming and shining God (Rev. 21:23). The redeeming God shines as the radiant God. The illuminating glory of God is the light within Christ, and the redeeming Christ is the lamp containing the light. God is always contained in Christ; He is the unique container of God. God&rsquo;s glory is the light of the city, and God is contained by Christ as the content, shining out through Christ.</p>
<p>In the Bible darkness is a form of punishment. God punished the Egyptians with a thick darkness for three days (Exo. 10:22), and in the future God will punish Antichrist and his kingdom with darkness (Rev. 16:10). Part of the enjoyment in the New Jerusalem is that there will be no night. The city will be full of light, and this light is God the Father. He will be not only the nature of the New Jerusalem but also the shining light as an enjoyment to the entire city. The first enjoyment in the New Jerusalem is God as our light. Our experience today is the same. When we are left in darkness, that is a real punishment. When we open our entire being to Him, however, we are in the light, and the light is God Himself enjoyed by us in our daily life. We cannot live in darkness. We can live only in the light.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem there will be no night, for &ldquo;night will be no more&rdquo; (Rev. 22:5). In the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction. Outside the city there will be night, but within the city there will be no night because we will have an eternal divine light, that is, God Himself. For the believers, there will be no night because in the holy city God Himself will be the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; that will never go down.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Lamb with God<br />
Being on the Throne within the City</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:1 speaks of &ldquo;the throne of God and of the Lamb.&rdquo; The Lamb with God is on the throne within the city. On this throne God and the Lamb will not sit beside each other; instead, God in Christ will sit on the throne. We know this because God as the light will dwell in the Lamb as the lamp (21:23). Because the light is in the lamp, these are not two entities but one entity in two aspects. Just as the light and the lamp are one unit, one entity, God and the Lamb are one entity.</p>
<p>We need to note that there are not two thrones, one for God and another for the Lamb, because light and the lamp can neither be separated, nor do they stand side-by-side. Rather, the light shines out from within the lamp. Therefore, God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp and shines out through Him.</p>
<p>God and the Lamb sit on the one throne in the way of coinherence, in the way of being two yet one. God sits in the Lamb, and the Lamb sits in God. God and the Lamb coinhere; They are one. They are one light, and They are sitting on one throne. This means that since God is in Christ sitting on the throne, both God and Christ sit on one throne in the heavens.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; From this verse we may have the impression that next to the throne of God, at His right hand, is another throne. However, in the book of Revelation we see that it is only one throne of both God and Christ. In Revelation 3:21 the Lord says that He sat with His Father on His throne. Revelation 22:3 goes on to say of the holy city, New Jerusalem, that &ldquo;the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it.&rdquo; Again, this verse does not speak of two thrones&mdash;one for God and another for the Lamb&mdash;but of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Hence, it is one throne for both. The fact that God in Christ is sitting on the throne means that God administrates the entire universe from within Christ and through Christ, just as the light shines from within the lamp and through the lamp. From this we can see that Christ is enthroned with God. God is on the throne, and this God is in the enthroned Christ, the God-man.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:3a says, &ldquo;There will no longer be a curse. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it.&rdquo; In the new heaven and new earth there will be no curse, because sin and death will be gone. However, there is an additional principle that where the throne of God is established, there the curse is gone. To have a curse means that we do not have the throne. If the throne of God is within us, we will have no curse.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Redeeming Triune God</h2>
<p>The one throne of God and of the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one&mdash;the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the God who will sit on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God&mdash;God, the Lamb, and the Spirit (symbolized by the water of life)&mdash;dispenses Himself into His redeemed under His headship (implied by the authority of the throne) for eternity.</p>
<p>The One on the throne is both the God who created and the Lamb who redeemed. Hence, we may call Him the Lamb-God. This means that He is the redeeming God. This redeeming God is on the throne of His administration so that He may dispense Himself into all His redeemed. For eternity in the New Jerusalem we will see the redeeming God, God in the Lamb.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:3 says, &ldquo;The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him.&rdquo; We need to notice that the pronouns in this verse are singular, not plural. This verse says, &ldquo;His slaves will serve Him&rdquo;; it does not say, &ldquo;Their slaves will serve Them.&rdquo; The singular pronoun, which refers to both God and the Lamb, proves that God and the Lamb are one. The throne of God and of the Lamb is the throne of the redeeming God, the Lamb-God. In Genesis 1:1 we have God, but in Revelation 22:1 we have God with the Lamb. In Genesis we have the creating God, but in Revelation we have the redeeming God. Out of this redeeming God as the source flows the river of water of life. The flow of the river of water of life is the fellowship of life. This means that fellowship is the outflow of the divine life from within the redeeming God.</p>
<p>The One on the throne is not just God and not just the Lamb but the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. According to Revelation 4:3, God, the One on the throne, &ldquo;was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance.&rdquo; Jasper, which is dark green, signifies God as the God of glory in His rich life, and sardius, which is red, signifies God as the God of redemption. The fact that the appearance of God on the throne is like a jasper stone and a sardius indicates that God is no longer just God but also our Redeemer. This also corresponds with Ezekiel 1, which speaks of the glowing electrum, a mixture of gold and silver, which signifies the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. Gold signifies the nature of God, and silver signifies redemption. The electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver, signifies the Lamb-God. This indicates that our God is not merely the divine Being; He is also the redeeming God.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Throne Being the Center of the City</h2>
<p>Every nation has a center, which is its capital, the place where the central government is located. The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1), the throne of our redeeming God. This throne is the administrative center of the city. Since there will be the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s ruling will be among the saints.</p>
<p>Today there are kings and queens on many thrones, but the day will come when in the entire universe there will be a central city, and the center of that central city will be the throne of God. The Possessor of that throne will be the redeeming God, God and the Lamb. For eternity we will not forget that He is not only our God but also our Redeemer. He has redeemed us back to Himself, and now we are centered around His throne. As the redeeming God, Christ will administrate within the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. From the throne Christ, the redeeming God, will carry out His administration, based on His redemption, in the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth. Christ&rsquo;s work of administrating within the New Jerusalem is for His expression through His administration.</p>
<p>In the first section of Revelation (1:1&mdash;11:19) the throne of God is the center, and in the second section (12:1&mdash;22:21) the temple of God is the center. At the end of the book of Revelation, the throne of God is in the temple. Thus, the throne and temple have become one.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between the temple and the city. The temple emphasizes a dwelling place, a habitation, whereas the city emphasizes administration. The temple is a matter of presence, whereas the city is a matter of sovereign power, authority. When the New Jerusalem appears, these two will be combined. The New Jerusalem is a city, which is of authority, and God&rsquo;s tabernacle with men, which is a dwelling. Hence, in the New Jerusalem we see both God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s authority. Although both aspects are combined, the emphasis in the city is on authority. Hence, the center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb, with God&rsquo;s sovereign power, God&rsquo;s authority (v. 3).</p>
<p>Our God is not only the God on the throne for His administration nor only the God in the temple for His expression. He is the God on the throne in the temple for His expression through His administration. God&rsquo;s throne is for His administration, and God&rsquo;s temple is for His expression. The fact that the throne is in the temple means that God&rsquo;s administration is for His expression. In eternity future God&rsquo;s throne will be in the center of the New Jerusalem, and His expression will extend to the circumference. Therefore, our God is both the God of administration and the God of expression.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Throne Being<br />
on the Top of the Golden Mountain</h2>
<p>The throne in the New Jerusalem is on top of the city, the top of the golden mountain. The one street in this city eventually leads to the throne. The Lord Jesus came down to earth from His throne that He might bring God into man. This is the Triune God coming out of Himself to reach mankind. When we received Him into us, we were baptized into Him. Baptism is the real entrance into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and the entrance into the Triune God is the initial entrance into the New Jerusalem. Immediately after we pass through the pearl gates, we find ourselves on the golden street that leads us upward to the throne of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Throne Being Built<br />
on the Golden Base as Its Foundation</h2>
<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb is founded on a golden base, which is God Himself. This throne is also one with the base. The throne and the base, both of which are of gold, are one (cf. 1 Kings 10:18).</p>
<p>The throne signifies the administration of the New Jerusalem. This means that the administration of the holy city, an organic building, is built on the base (God the Father&rsquo;s nature) as its foundation. Psalm 89:14 says that righteousness is the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne. This implies that the nature of God as the foundation of God&rsquo;s administration refers, in this aspect, to God&rsquo;s attribute of righteousness. God has a nature, and His nature is of many attributes, which include love, light, holiness, righteousness, and kindness. All these divine virtues are the attributes of God. Among all these divine attributes, the most important is righteousness. This is why we need to be saved according to God&rsquo;s righteousness (Rom. 1:16-17; 3:21-22). If we are saved only according to God&rsquo;s grace or according to God&rsquo;s love, our salvation is not legally justified&mdash;it is not judicial. Anything that is of righteousness is judicial, legal, according to the law.</p>
<p>The foundation of God&rsquo;s throne is not grace or love. Such a foundation would not be sure to us. God&rsquo;s throne is established on righteousness as its foundation. This righteousness is the main attribute in God&rsquo;s nature. In the New Jerusalem both the street and the base are gold, signifying God&rsquo;s nature in the attribute of righteousness. This is the foundation of the throne of God.</p><h2 class="head5">5) The Throne Being the Source and Goal<br />
of the Divine Administration</h2>
<p>The throne has a source, and the throne is the source; the throne has a goal, and the throne is the goal. It is the source flowing out and the goal coming back. This is the divine traffic, and this traffic is the administration. This traffic, this administration, is signified by a golden street, which is the base itself. Each one of us needs to declare, &ldquo;I am not a person without a throne in the universe. I have the throne of God, and I am in His administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb is for God&rsquo;s administration. God is the One who had a purpose, made a plan in eternity past, and created all things for the fulfillment of His plan. The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who has accomplished a full redemption to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Thus, the throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God&rsquo;s plan through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Both God&rsquo;s plan and Christ&rsquo;s redemption are being carried out through this throne. The throne is the source from which the river of water of life flows, and it flows with the tree of life growing in it (Rev. 22:2). The throne for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to flow out God Himself so that by this flow of life His purpose could be accomplished.</p>
<p>God who is in us is the source of life. The throne of God and of the Lamb should be the center of our being. In the meeting we may say the throne is in us, but many times in our daily living, the throne is often neglected by us. We need to ask ourselves if we have the throne of God in us in our living. Who is our Lord, Head, and authority in our daily life? Often, even in small things, we would not let the throne rule in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head5">6) The Throne Being the Source of the Divine Fellowship</h2>
<p>The throne is the source not only of God&rsquo;s administration but also of the divine fellowship. The street signifies not only the traffic of God&rsquo;s administration but also the fellowship of God&rsquo;s redeemed. This divine fellowship, signified by the street with its communication, flows with the divine supply. This supply is the river of the water of life and the tree of life. The river is for beverage, and the tree is for food, for life supply. One is for quenching, and the other is for nourishing.</p>
<p>The administration of the New Jerusalem, an organic building, is joined to the street, the communication of which, from the throne to the gates, signifies the execution of the administration of this organic building. In the New Jerusalem there is a street that is joined to the throne. The street is for communication. The street joined to the throne is for the governmental dealings, the administration, in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Revelation 22 shows that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (vv. 1-2). Hence, when God and the Lamb are enthroned in our being and are able to rule and reign in us, this life will be manifested as power that supplies us inwardly. Because the Lord desires to set up His throne within us, He cares for the authority, the ground, and the dominion within us. We must give Him the dominion. God has already made Him Lord and Christ and has given Him all authority in heaven and on earth. The entire universe is His domain. Yet it seems that we are those who do not give Him the authority. God has made Him King, but we may not honor Him as King. Instead, often in our daily living, we are our own king and do many things by ourselves. Even to this day there seems to be little room for Christ in us. Our inner being may not be Christ&rsquo;s domain but our own domain. It seems that in many things we are the lord, we are in control, and we have the final word. The Lord Jesus is frustrated in us. He is the Lord who is enthroned in heaven, but He may not be enthroned in our heart.</p>
<p>The church is the place where God exercises His authority, and the throne of God&rsquo;s Son is set up among the churches. His authority and reign should have the ground in all the saints. Although they all have God&rsquo;s life, the Lord Himself, and the Lord&rsquo;s throne, authority, and kingdom in them, many will not submit to the Lord&rsquo;s authority, allow the Lord to be seated on the throne within them, or allow Him to establish His kingdom and obtain His domain in their being. We must realize that if this is our situation, we cannot be living and strong Christians, the power of the Lord Jesus cannot be expressed through us, and the divine life cannot be a supply to us.</p>
<p>The gospel saves us so that we may become the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. God regenerates us with His life so that we may have the throne of His Son in us. Satan seeks to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority in the universe. He is unwilling to let God&rsquo;s authority be brought to earth. In the meantime, he also usurps the earth among the worldly people so that God&rsquo;s kingdom cannot come to earth and His authority cannot be exercised among men. Through His Son&rsquo;s dying for man, being raised from the dead, cleansing away man&rsquo;s sins with His blood, and regenerating man with His life, God brings His throne, His authority, and His kingdom into the saved ones so that they may have His authority in them and become His kingdom.</p>
<p>We need to apply the throne of God with its administration to our daily life. Every day we need to realize that we are persons who are under the divine throne and who are also in the divine administration. We need to remember this crucial matter; this is to apply the throne and the administration. If we can remember that we are persons under the divine throne and in the divine administration, this will change our daily life. With this realization we cannot be loose and uncontrolled. Every day we need to apply this. We should remember: &ldquo;I am a God-man under the throne of God and in the administration of God. I cannot be free. I am fully ruled, governed, by the Lord.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head5">7) The Throne Being the Unique Source<br />
of the Life Supply</h2>
<p>The throne of God in the center of the New Jerusalem is the unique source of the life supply. It is by His administration that God dispenses Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the eternal, absolute, all-inclusive grace. His dispensing of Himself into us depends upon His administration. For this reason, in the church life today there is divine authority and church government. There is a divine government in the church life today, and this government comes from the throne of God. The divine authority in the church is for God to dispense Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the all-sufficient grace. Only by submitting ourselves to God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s government, can we share in His all-sufficient grace.</p>
<p>The throne of grace in Hebrews 4:16 is the throne of authority in Revelation 4, which becomes in Revelation 22:1 and 2 the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the crystal clear river of water of life. This river flows through the whole city of New Jerusalem. Within this river grows the tree of life, revealing that the rich Christ with the living Spirit flows out of the throne of grace. Grace is the flowing river in which the tree of life grows. To the unbelievers and to the demons, the throne of God and of the Lamb is a throne merely of authority; to us, it is the throne of grace. Whenever we come to this throne, we have the sense that something is flowing to water and supply us. This is grace. We can surely drink and eat of this supply.</p>
<p>On the throne of grace is not only God but also the Lamb, the Redeemer. On the wonderful throne of grace, God is sitting, and at His right hand is the Redeemer, our High Priest. That the throne is not only the throne of God but the throne of God and of the Lamb means that God in the Lamb is flowing Himself out as grace for our enjoyment. We need not do anything. We simply need to come forward, open up, and receive mercy and find grace for timely help. Every day the help that comes from this grace is very timely. It is always new and exactly fits our situation and need.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s mercy and grace are always available to us. However, we need to receive and find them by exercising our spirit to come forward to the throne of grace. The throne of God is the throne of grace. Whenever we come to the throne of grace, the grace of God is like a river flowing to us.</p>
<p>Today in our spirit there is heaven, the throne of authority, and the throne of grace with God and the Lamb. When we call on the Lord, we are in our spirit, and our spirit is in the heavens with the throne of authority, the throne of grace, and the coinhering God sitting on the throne.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s throne is thus the source of the flowing grace. To dethrone Him, to take the throne away from Him, is to disregard the source of grace. This causes the flow of grace to cease. This is not a mere doctrine but something very experiential. Many of us can testify that whenever we fail to enthrone the Lord, we do not receive grace in our times of prayer.</p>
<p>In eternity we will also enjoy the throne of God and of the Lamb (v. 3). In Hebrews 4 the throne is the throne of grace, but in Revelation 4 the throne is mainly the throne of authority. At the end of the Bible, the throne is both the throne of authority and the throne of grace. The throne of God and of the Lamb is certainly for God&rsquo;s divine administration. Thus, it is the throne of authority. However, proceeding out of the throne is not authority but the river of water of life with the tree of life as the life supply. This is not only authority but also grace.</p>
<p>We should never separate authority from grace or grace from authority. Grace and authority are one. If we have grace, we are under authority, and if we are under authority, we partake of grace. Although it is true that, as Christians, we need to reign, we should not reign by authority. Rather, we should reign through the flow of life. The eldership, the representation of the headship, must be exercised through the flow of life. Although the throne is the throne of authority, the throne of headship, out of the throne flows the river of water of life. When we look at the throne, we see authority and headship. But when we look at the river, we see the water of life and the tree of life. This indicates that proper eldership is not the exercise of authority over others; it is the flowing of life into them. We are reigning, but we do not reign by authority; we reign through the flowing of the inner life.</p>
<p>Today the Lord Jesus does not reign merely with authority. He is reigning in the church, among the churches, and over all the churches through the flowing of His life as grace. The more we partake of His life, the more authority we have. The ones whom you respect in the church life are those who are mature in life. However, no one who assumes authority will be respected. Deep in the spirits of the saints there is no respect for that kind of eldership. Life is the expression of authority. Instead of assuming authority, we need to live out Christ. The Christ whom we live out will be our authority over others. We will enjoy this kind of authority for eternity. The throne, the source of the life supply with the divine authority, will be our eternal enjoyment.</p>
<p>We have experienced that when we subject ourselves to this headship, we immediately sense something full of God&rsquo;s riches flowing within us. This is the flow of the Triune God as life, life supply, and everything to our being. Within us we sense such a flow, and this flow is from the throne of God and of the Lamb as the water of life.</p>
<p>In Revelation 22:1 we see the flow of the Divine Trinity&mdash;God, the Lamb, and the water of life (the Spirit). According to John 7:38-39, the water of life refers to the Spirit. God was the One who purposed, became the redeeming Lamb (1:14, 29), and became the life-giving, flowing Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). God flows in the water of life, the Lamb flows in the water of life, and the Spirit flows as the water of life. Thus, this is the triune flow, the flow of the Divine Trinity as the life supply.</p>
<p>We must realize that whenever the throne is gone, there is no source of the flow. This is why many times we have the feeling that we are dry and even dried up. There is not the flow of the living water because we do not accept or recognize the lordship, the headship, and the authority of the Triune God in the center of our being. This is why the throne is the last item revealed concerning the New Jerusalem. Without the throne, the New Jerusalem does not have a center, and without the throne, there is no flow of life. As a result, the entire New Jerusalem would be dried up and even starved to death. The water of life flows out of the throne, and the tree of life grows in the water of life and on the two sides of the river of the water of life as a vine producing timely fruits for the food of God&rsquo;s redeemed for eternity. Both the water of life and the tree of life are the issue of the throne. If there were no throne in us, what would be the issue? Many Christians are dried up, starved to death, and without growth in life because the throne is neglected in their experience.</p>
<p>According to our daily experiences, we Christians should experience the flow of the Divine Trinity every day. Every morning after rising up, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for a new day for me to take You as my Lord. I subject myself under Your headship for the whole day. Lord, set up Your throne in my life. Set up Your throne in the center of my being. Lord, bring my whole day with my daily life under Your throne.&rdquo; If we offer such a prayer to the Triune God every morning, we will have the living water flowing within us. This living water flowing in us is the flow of the Triune God. It is not a small thing that the Triune God flows in us today. He flows in us as the One who purposed, as the One who redeemed, and as the One who is the life-giving Spirit. This One is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us as the living water.</p>
<p>Our daily life must be a life of the New Jerusalem. In that day when we arrive at the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation, we should not be surprised, because today we are experiencing the same thing. What will be in the New Jerusalem will be an intensification and a consummation of our present experience. Today we are experiencing the throne of God and of the Lamb out of which flows the Triune God for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">8) The Throne Being the Center of the Christian Life</h2>
<p>In our Christian life the center is the throne of God and of the Lamb. We are not here living for ourselves. We are living and existing for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose in order to carry out what Christ has accomplished. Therefore, we experience the One on the throne in His headship and lordship, and we submit ourselves to such an authority. In our daily life, in our family life, in our married life, in our business life, and in our church life, the center must be God&rsquo;s throne. Everything should be subjected to His headship.</p>
<p>In our Christian experience the unique item should be the throne of the One who purposed and of the One who redeemed. Such a throne must be set up in our entire being, and this should be the center of our Christian life. This means that we would accept the God who purposed and the Christ who redeemed us as our Head, Lord, and authority. We should be willing to subject ourselves to such a headship. We adore Him as the Lord, and we take Him as our authority. We enthrone Him in our being and in our Christian life.</p>
<p>Within us, in the center of our being, there should be the throne of God and of the Lamb. Whenever we would take the Triune God as our Head, the divine life begins to flow in our being. We need to apply this to our daily life in every instance and in every thing. Even in our talk to the members of our family, we need to practice submitting ourselves to the inner throne. We should not look into the heavens but to the center of our entire being where there should be a throne. The throne should be prevailing in the center of our being. Then the water of life will be proceeding out of the throne to supply us and to bring to us the tree of life which nourishes us all day long.</p>
<p>We need to realize that what is recorded in Revelation 21 and 22 should be experienced by us today in a very personal way. Experientially, every proper and normal Christian is &ldquo;a little New Jerusalem.&rdquo; Whatever is ascribed to the New Jerusalem corporately should be experienced by us individually and personally. Furthermore, in each one of us there should be the throne of God and of the Lamb. We must enthrone Him in our heart and in our spirit. In other words, in the center of our being there should be the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(30)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Christ as the Tree of Life Growing<br />
on the Two Sides of the River of Water of Life</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb flows the river of water of life, and in this river the tree of life grows as a spreading vine. The river of water of life in the New Jerusalem signifies the consummated Spirit. Eventually, God&rsquo;s Spirit will be a river. This river of water of life is in the city&rsquo;s unique spiral street. In the whole city there is only one street. The street with the river spirals down the mountain to reach every part of the city and all its twelve gates. The street is the communication that ministers something to us. This is the ministering communication to water the whole city for the city&rsquo;s drink. The tree of life, the life-supplying Christ, is a great vine growing on the two sides of the river to nourish the entire city for its food. God&rsquo;s throne is for His government, the river is for our watering, and the tree of life is for our nourishment. The Triune God governs, serves, waters, and feeds the entire city.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as the life supply to us (Gen. 2:9; John 1:4; 14:6). This tree is the embodiment of life. According to the divine revelation, only God Himself is life in the entire universe. This God who is life is absolutely embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9). Christ is the tree of life, and in this tree of life is the full enjoyment of all the riches of life.</p>
<p>In brief, the tree of life in the Bible is a figure of the Triune God embodied in Christ to be the substance of the divine life. This tree is good for man to take and eat (Gen. 2:16; John 6:57b) that man may be constituted with God as the constituent of life. Thus, man and God become organically united and live together as one person (15:5; Phil. 1:20-21a). Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. Therefore, we need to take Him as our supply, as the substance of the divine life, in which we can be victorious and overcoming, even reigning in His eternal life (Rom. 5:17). Eventually, we will be co-kings with Christ in the thousand-year kingdom (Rev. 3:21; 20:4).</p>
<p>We all have two lives. We have the natural life, the human life, and we have the spiritual life, the divine life. The natural life is just our self and the divine life is also a person, Christ. Each one of us is also two persons, one person being our self and the other being Christ in us. We have the life from Adam, and we have the life that is Christ Himself in us. We all need to live by Christ, the divine life, not by our self, the natural life.</p>
<p>Today we should enjoy God as our life and as our life supply. Out of the enjoyment of the Lord as our life supply, we will have our daily life, our walk, our work, and the building up of the churches. Then everything we have will be according to God&rsquo;s divine element, not according to our own concepts.</p>
<p>The tree of life is one of the outstanding features of New Jerusalem. In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the old heaven, the old earth, the old garden, Adam, and the tree of life (Gen. 1:1; 2:7-9). In the last two chapters of the Bible we see the new heaven, the new earth, and the city with the tree of life (Rev. 21:1-2; 22:2). In this city we do not see Adam but Israel and the apostles, who represent the new man. In the garden in Genesis there was the old man; in the city in Revelation there is the corporate new man. In the garden there was the tree of life, and in the city there is also the tree of life. The heaven and earth have changed, the garden has been changed into the city, and the first man has been changed into the corporate new man. But the tree of life remains unchanged. Everything has been changed or improved except the tree of life. From the beginning to the end, the tree of life remains the same; the tree of life never changes.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Tree of Life Revealed in the Bible</h2>
<p>In the Bible the tree of life is mentioned first in Genesis 2, and it proceeds to the end of the Bible in Revelation 22. At the beginning of God&rsquo;s relationship with man in Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life (vv. 8-9). Immediately, God brought this man out of His creating hand to the tree of life. This indicates that what God wanted man to do was to eat the tree of life. The tree of life is a sign, signifying that the creating God is the life supply to His created man.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:9 says, &ldquo;With You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; According to this verse, with God there is the fountain of life. The tree of life must be related to life, which is in God. Thus, God is the fountain, the source, of life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; The word <em>Him</em> in this verse refers to <em>the Word</em> in verse 1, who is God Himself. In the Word, who is God, is life. In John 14:6 Christ came and told us, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo;; in 10:10, He declared, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo;; and in John 15:1 He said, &ldquo;I am the true vine.&rdquo; Besides Christ, every vine is a false one; only He is the true vine. A vine is a tree, and if we put together these two matters of life and the tree, we have the tree of life. The tree of life is the Triune God who embodied Himself in Christ. Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God, is the life in the vine tree. Therefore, Christ is the tree of life.</p>
<p>Then in Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus said that to him who overcomes He will give to eat of the tree of life. At the end of the Bible there is the holy city with the river flowing with the living water (22:1). In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life (v. 2). The tree of life fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning (Gen. 2:9). The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall (3:22-24), but it has been opened to believers by the redemption of Christ (Heb. 10:19-20). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers&rsquo; common portion (John 6:35, 57). In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their reward (Rev. 2:7). Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, all of God&rsquo;s redeemed will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their eternal portion (22:14, 19).</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Tree of Life Being a Vine Tree</h2>
<p>The tree of life is a vine tree, not a pine tree. A pine grows by shooting upward into the heavens, but a vine grows by stretching forth to reach people. Since Christ is a vine, everyone can partake of His fruit. In the New Jerusalem the tree of life grows like a vine close to the earth on the two banks of the river. It is one tree, but it grows on two sides of the river. If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty. But the tree of life as a vine is lower than we are; thus, it is so easy to obtain its fruit. The tree of life is spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy.</p>
<p>The tree of life as a great vine is the available food, the nourishment, for God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity; hence, it is the life pulse of the New Jerusalem. Christ is the vine tree, and we are the branches (John 15:5). He is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy, and God&rsquo;s economy consummates in the New Jerusalem. The centrality and universality of this holy city is the tree of life, the greatest vine in the universe. This vine comprises our God, our Lord, our Master, our Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, and us. We are a part of this vine because we are the branches.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem, the ultimate item is the tree of life. If there were no tree of life in the holy city, there would be no food by which God&rsquo;s redeemed can live. The center of the New Jerusalem is the tree of life for the feeding and nourishing of the entire city. The Bible begins and ends with the tree of life as the center in order to carry out an organic union between God and us by our drinking of God as the water of life and our eating of Him as the tree of life. The water of life quenches our thirst from within by our drinking, and the tree of life nourishes us from within by our eating. In the New Jerusalem this is to maintain the organic union. For eternity we will be organically united with God every day and every minute by our eating and drinking of Him. This nourishing tree is the center of the entire New Jerusalem. The story of the Bible is that God made the tree of life the center.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Street, the River, and the Tree</h2>
<p>Where there is the street, there is the river; and where the river is, the tree of life is growing. Once we enter the gate, we have three things before us: a unique street on which to walk, a unique river of which to drink, and a unique tree on which to feed.</p>
<p>In the midst of the street is the river; hence, the street spontaneously becomes the two banks of the river. The tree of life grows as a vine on the banks of the river. The street, the river, and the tree are all interrelated. After we enter through the pearl gate and get on the golden street, we immediately have the flowing river. Along the flow of the living water is the tree of life.</p>
<p>The street of the holy city is pure gold (Rev. 21:21). Gold symbolizes the divine nature. That the river of water of life proceeds &ldquo;in the middle of its street&rdquo; (22:1) signifies that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Where the divine life flows, there the divine nature is as the holy way by which God&rsquo;s people walk, and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. Thus, God&rsquo;s river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy the river by walking in this way of life.</p>
<p>The street is the two banks of the river on which the tree of life grows, and the street signifies the divine nature as our holy way. When we take the way according to God&rsquo;s nature, the life of God flows within us. When we act according to God&rsquo;s nature, we immediately sense that the flow of life is watering us.</p>
<p>When we walk and move in the nature of God, we sense not only the flow of life within us but also the supply of life, the nourishment of life, the spiritual food. When we take the divine way, the street of God&rsquo;s nature, we will have the life flowing in us and the life supply nourishing us. Day by day, as we are living such a life and walking according to God&rsquo;s nature, we enjoy the water of life and the tree of life as our supply. We all need a day-by-day experience of the divine street of gold with the river of water of life and the tree of life in its middle, signifying that the life water and the life supply flow in the divine way. This vine, the tree of life, grows within and along the middle of the street. Thus, in the middle of the fellowship is the tree of life.</p>
<p>If we do not follow the inward regulation of the divine nature, the flow within us will stop. In contrast, if we follow the inner regulation, we will find ourselves walking on the golden street and sense that the inner flow is intensified and strengthened. We will also sense that the inner flow brings us the rich supply of life. This is what it means to walk on the golden street, to partake of the flowing river, and to enjoy all the riches of the tree of life.</p>
<p>Whenever we submit our entire being to the headship of the redeeming God, His throne is set up within us. Out of this throne flows the river of life. This river of life flows in the midst of the golden street, and along this flowing river there is the tree of life, which is a vine growing along the river as our rich life supply. The throne is here, waiting for us to submit to the headship and authority of the redeeming God. As soon as we submit to this headship, the life-giving Spirit immediately flows within us, and we find ourselves on the golden street. As we walk along the golden street, we find that the inward flowing of the life-giving Spirit is marvelous, refreshing, satisfying, and supplying. Along this flow of the living water there are the riches of the tree of life that grows by the flow of the river. This means that where the flow of the river is, there is the tree of life to supply us. In our experience we should have a throne, the flowing of the water of life, and Christ as the tree of life growing within us in a very practical way. This is not a doctrinal understanding; it is absolutely a matter of experience in life.</p>
<p>The street begins from the mountaintop, which represents God Himself, to reach all the twelve gates of the city. As we have seen, in the midst of this street is the river of water of life to flow out the riches of God to be our supply. The street with the river is a two-way traffic, proceeding down and spiraling up. This coming and going is the fellowship. All who enter into the city through the pearl gates participate in the same fellowship. This fellowship begins from God as the source to reach all twelve gates. That means it reaches all the ones who have entered into the city to bring them back to God.</p>
<p>Human beings need food as the supply to nourish them, and without water they cannot survive. We need water as our beverage to match the food that we eat. The tree of life is for our nourishment, and the river of water of life is for our drinking. For our growth in the divine life, Christ nourishes us and the Spirit quenches our thirst, and the growth of the divine life is for the building up of the city as the organic constitution of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</p>
<p>The river of life flows out of the throne and spirals down the mountain, eventually reaching all twelve gates on each of the four sides. This indicates that the flow of the Triune God waters the whole city. Every part of the city receives the life supply, because the tree of life grows in the river, and the river reaches every part of the city. The tree of life is a vine growing on both sides of the river. Only as a vine could its growth follow the flow of the river. The river moves in spiral fashion, and the tree grows in the same way. It is like a grapevine, making many turns as it grows along the flow of the river of life. Wherever the river flows, the tree of life grows. Thus, the supply of life is in the flow of life. In the church life today we have the flow of the river of life, that is, the flow of the life-giving Spirit. With this life-giving Spirit we have Christ as the tree of life to be our life supply.</p>
<p>In the entire Bible the books that speak most clearly concerning God&rsquo;s flowing out as life are Ezekiel and Revelation. Ezekiel and Revelation both show us the flow of the living water. Ezekiel 47:1 speaks of the river that flows out of the house of God. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Everything shall live wherever the river comes,&rdquo; and verse 12 says, &ldquo;On the banks on both sides of the river will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail; but they will bring forth new fruit every month, because the water for them flows out of the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for healing.&rdquo; Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In both Ezekiel and Revelation, therefore, we have a river flowing out of God with the life supply.</p>
<p>By the water of life and by the tree of life, the New Jerusalem will be richly supplied for eternity. Through this abundant supply of life, the oneness of the New Jerusalem will be forever maintained. Division will not be possible in the holy city. The light will shine throughout the city, and the life will water and supply the city. This life and light will eliminate the possibility of division. Even the nations that surround the new city will be one. At that time, all things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ (Eph. 1:10). This will be the ultimate, universal, and eternal oneness. This oneness will be kept and preserved in life and with light.</p><h2 class="head5">4) Producing Twelve Fruits, Yielding Its Fruit<br />
Each Month for the Saints</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God&rsquo;s redeemed for eternity. They will be continually fresh, produced every month, twelve fruits yearly. Every month there will be a crop, and the tree of life will produce twelve fruits to be our life supply. This depicts that today our Triune God embodied in Christ is our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Our experience should not be like the children of Israel who ate the same food, the manna, every day for forty years. We should have new fruit, that is, new experiences of Christ. Some dear saints enjoy the same fruit for twenty years. They testify of their experience of Christ one year, and many years later they testify of the same experience. Eventually, they lose their taste to repeat their testimony. Their experiences are good but too old. We need new experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>The fact that there are twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and sufficient for the completion in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. The significance of the number twelve is eternal completion in God&rsquo;s administration for His economy. God redeemed us to enjoy the tree of life, and this enjoyment is for God&rsquo;s administration in His eternal economy.</p>
<p>The mention of &ldquo;each month&rdquo; indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months. The sun will also be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each. The number seven represents the church and signifies that God is added to His creature, man, in His present dispensation, whereas twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem, signifying that God is mingled with man in His eternal administration. In the New Jerusalem there are the twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles, twelve gates which are the twelve pearls with the names of the twelve tribes, and twelve fruits of the tree of life. As far as space is concerned, the city proper is twelve thousand stadia, one thousand times twelve, in three dimensions, and its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, which is twelve times twelve. As for time, in the new heaven and new earth, there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly.</p>
<p>The fruit borne by the tree of life is good for food (Gen. 2:9), good to nourish us. The water of life quenches our thirst, and the tree of life nourishes us, feeds us, and satisfies us organically (Rev. 22:14; 2:7). As the tree of life, Christ is a fruit tree for eating. He is a vine full of life for eating. For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ. The riches of Christ are for us to eat and enjoy.</p>
<p>A vine tree does not produce material for the construction of a building but only fruit for eating. The fruit of the vine is for two purposes. First, the fruit is for the propagation and multiplication of the vine; second, it is for food to provide nourishment to the eaters. Christ today is such a vine, bearing fruit for His propagation and multiplication and for our nourishment.</p>
<p>When a local church is full of the fruits of life, producing new fruit every month, the abundance of life will be fully manifested. Every local church should be a place where people are fed, nourished, watered, and satisfied. However, this is not the situation in many local churches because of the absence of God&rsquo;s throne in those churches. The abundance of life flows out from the throne. When God&rsquo;s throne is established in a church, life flows. As soon as life flows, there is watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching. When people touch such a church, they touch living water and life, and they are spontaneously satisfied.</p>
<p>Our destiny and our portion for eternity will be the enjoyment of the tree of life and the water of life. The Bible concludes with a promise and a call. The promise is found in Revelation 22:14, which says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life.&rdquo; The call is found in Revelation 22:17, which says, &ldquo;Let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; Thus, the whole Bible ends with eating and drinking, with enjoying God as the tree of life and drinking Him as the water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">5) The Leaves of the Tree Being<br />
for the Healing of the Nations</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). According to the record of the Bible, the first time man used leaves was to make a covering for himself. The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity; the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly, that they may live the human life forever. When the nations look at the way the Lord Jesus acts and behaves, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.</p>
<p>In the Bible leaves denote man&rsquo;s good Christian behavior. Good behavior can heal man&rsquo;s corruption. When we enjoy Christ as the tree of life, the unbelievers are regulated by our conduct, which we live out of Christ. For example, if there are some households of saints living in an apartment building, and they come and go in a proper and modest manner, this will affect everyone in the apartment building. Such a testimony would be very helpful for the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 14:34-35, after Jesus and the disciples came to Gennesaret, the people of that place brought to the Lord all who were ill. Verse 36 says, &ldquo;They begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed.&rdquo; The healing power went out, not from the inner being of Christ but from the fringe of His garment. The Lord&rsquo;s garment signifies Christ&rsquo;s righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling (Num. 15:38-39). Out of Christ&rsquo;s heaven-ruled deeds is the virtue that becomes the healing power. According to Numbers 15, the fringe of the garment signifies the virtue of God&rsquo;s people who walk according to His regulations. The fringe was made with a blue ribbon. This revealed that their daily walk was regulated by God&rsquo;s heavenly rule as indicated by the color blue, a heavenly color. When Jesus was on earth as a man, He walked in this way; His daily walk was regulated by God&rsquo;s heavenly commandments. Therefore, there was with Him a virtue that could flow out to heal others.</p>
<p>The healing that takes place in the church life does not mainly issue from the inner being of the Lord Jesus. Rather, it primarily issues from the virtue of the Lord&rsquo;s human life. In the church life we experience the Lord&rsquo;s presence with us on the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; in the midst of the &ldquo;contrary winds&rdquo; (Matt. 14:24). His presence prepares the way for His virtue to flow out to reach the sick people and to heal them. This type of healing is different from the miraculous healing by divine power. The garment of Jesus does not signify His divinity. Rather, it signifies the righteous deeds of His humanity. His humanity bore the mark of the blue ribbon, of being regulated by the heavenly ruling. This produced a virtue that was capable of healing the sick. This kind of virtue can be expressed only through the proper church life where Jesus is present.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and the new earth, the leaves of the tree of life will be for the healing of the nations; that is, the virtue of Christ&rsquo;s humanity will heal the people. In Matthew, after the boat reached its destination, the virtue of the Lord&rsquo;s human deeds became so prevailing that every manner of sickness was healed (vv. 34-36). Likewise, when we have the proper church life with the Lord&rsquo;s presence today, there is among us the uplifted humanity of Jesus. This uplifted humanity has the virtue signified by the fringe of Christ&rsquo;s garment. If we, the church people, have the proper church life and live by Christ, we will live out His uplifted humanity. In this kind of living there will be a virtue with the power to heal those around us. We must live out the uplifted humanity of Jesus to have the virtue that can heal those surrounding us. For others to be healed means that their corrupted character is changed. Those around the church life are all in darkness and corruption. But if the church people live out the uplifted humanity of Christ, this will cause healing power to flow into them.</p>
<p>The sons of God are regenerated to be the new creation. The peoples of God are not regenerated but restored to their created condition that was lost due to the fall of Adam. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the heaven, the earth, and all created things were reconciled, redeemed back to God (Col. 1:20). Redemption is not a matter of the divine life. To be redeemed is not to be regenerated. For the heavens and the earth to be redeemed does not mean that they are regenerated. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is not only for us, the regenerated people, but also for all the things in the heavens and the earth (v. 20; Heb. 2:9). The sheep in the millennial kingdom and the peoples of God outside the New Jerusalem will be the restored ones and the redeemed ones, but they have never been and will never be regenerated. The New Jerusalem will be the composition of all the regenerated, saved, and transformed persons. But the nations will be there simply as natural, restored people. From the New Jerusalem a group of kings and priests will rule over the restored nations.</p>
<p>After Christ destroys all the evil ones, He will set up His throne in today&rsquo;s Jerusalem to gather all the nations who are left and to judge them (Matt. 25:32-46). He will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. They will be judged based upon how they have treated the Lord&rsquo;s brothers during the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The sheep are those who have helped the Lord&rsquo;s brothers&mdash;the Jews and the Christians&mdash;during the great tribulation. These sheep will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. Those of the nations who treated Christ&rsquo;s brothers poorly will be considered as the goats. They will go directly to the lake of fire, just like Antichrist and the false prophet. The nations who are the sheep will be in the new earth as the people of God for eternity. They will be the restored and purified nations outside the city, the people who are not regenerated to have the uncreated life of God but who are restored in their created life to its original state, preserved forever by the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2b). All God&rsquo;s redeemed people, including the Old Testament saints, the New Testament saints, and the saved Jews in the millennium, will be kings reigning in the realm of the eternal life over the nations (v. 5b; 21:24) who will continue to remain in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The fruit of the tree of life will be our food on which we live. The tree of life will be the processed and consummated Triune God as our life forever. But the leaves of the tree of life will be the healing element to sustain the restored nations forever.</p>
<p>The nations are restored miraculously, but we believers are sustained by life. We are not the nations; we are the sons produced by regeneration and sustained by the enjoyment of the fruit of the tree of life, that is, by the essence of the tree of life. We are now enjoying the New Jerusalem as the finalization of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For eternity we will enjoy life and life alone. We will enjoy nothing else but life.</p>
<p>In short, in the new heaven and the new earth the tree of life has two functions. One function is to produce the fruit to feed the believers, and the other function is to produce leaves for the healing of the nations. Healing is something miraculous. The miraculous healing through the leaves of the tree of life is related to the physical body of the nations. The fruit of the tree of life which feeds the believers is related to the divine life within them.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Christ Being the Eternal King, Reigning<br />
with All His Saints Forever and Ever</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; In Revelation 22:5 we are told that the believers &ldquo;will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; To reign forever will be the final blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. This reigning is an issue, a glorious, eternal, corporate consummation of our present reigning in life through the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness unto eternal life. This is a blessing we will enjoy for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth. We will be kings over the nations, reigning forever.</p>
<p>We need to remember that we are members of the royal family, kings of the kingly family. Even when we are at a restaurant, we should remember that we are kings eating there. We are heaven-born kings; hence, we should never sell our royal status. If we consider that we are kings, we would not act lightly, talk loosely, or behave meanly. We can even preach the gospel with this in view. We may tell others that we are kings. Then we may start our preaching of the gospel by saying, &ldquo;The Bible tells me that, as a child of God, I am a king.&rdquo; There are many ways to preach the gospel. We need this kind of vital preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>In eternity the believers as sons of God and as the constituents of the New Jerusalem will all be kings. The angels will be serving ones (Heb. 1:13-14), serving us. They are the servants of the royal family, and we are kings over the nations. This is the kingdom of God in eternity.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(31)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">16. Christ as the Alpha and the Omega</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Alpha and the Omega</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:12-13 Christ is revealed as the Alpha and the Omega. In Revelation 22:13 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s declaration at the close of this book; it corresponds with what God declared in the opening of this book. Revelation 1:8 says that the Lord God is the Alpha and the Omega. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is God. This also shows that God and the Lord Jesus are one and that the Son and the Father can never be separated.</p>
<p>The eternal and almighty God is the Alpha, the beginning for the origination, and the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose. In the book of Genesis He was the Alpha, and now in the book of Revelation He is the Omega. Whatever He has originated He will complete. Governmentally, He continues His universal operation which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion (21:6). Although man fell, God still intends to accomplish His economy. He is the God with whom is the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega. Once He begins something, He will never give it up. As the Alpha, God is the beginning; He originated all things of the universe. He will be the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose; He will finalize and finish what He has initiated.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:8 Paul says that God will confirm us &ldquo;until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that a genuine church needs to grow in life (3:6) after its initial receiving of grace and that it will be unreprovable in the day of Christ&rsquo;s coming. After receiving grace as our base, we need to grow in grace so that we will be unreprovable in the day of Christ&rsquo;s coming. <em>Who</em> in 1:8 refers not to Christ but to God in verse 4. God has given us grace, and this God will also confirm us to the end. He is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the Giver of grace at the beginning and the Completer of our growth in life at the end. He will confirm us until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord whom we serve is the Alpha and the Omega. This does not mean, however, that Christ is only these two letters and not all the letters in between. Because He is the first letter, He is also all the other letters. The principle is the same with respect to the slaughter of the firstborn in the book of Exodus (12:12). The firstborn of the Egyptians represented all the Egyptians. Likewise, when the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation.</p>
<p>The twelve precious stones in the breastplate mentioned in Exodus 28 typify the believers, the components of the church, inscribed with Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet. Christ is the alphabet used to compose words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and books. The letters inscribed on the twelve stones in the breastplate typify Christ as the letters in the heavenly alphabet.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Basic Factor of the Bible,<br />
the Church, and Our Living</h2>
<p>As the Alpha and the Omega, Christ is the basic factor in the composition of the Bible. We can truly say, therefore, that the Bible is written with Christ. Christ is the letters that compose every verse of the Bible. The entire Godhead, embodied in Christ, is the divine alphabet. Actually, the New Testament is not composed of the letters of the Greek alphabet; instead, it is composed of the letters in the divine and heavenly alphabet, letters which are actually the Triune God Himself.</p>
<p>In our human living, Christ should be the entire alphabet. If He is our alphabet, He will automatically become every word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter, and ultimately the whole book. God&rsquo;s economy is that our entire human living be written, composed, with Christ as the unique factor. Christ is all-extensive; He comes in to fill every part of our living. Therefore, the dictionary of our Christian life should have just one word: <em>Christ.</em></p>
<p>The church is the masterpiece, the poem, of God (Eph. 2:10). The church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed with the Triune God as letters of the alphabet. The Triune God Himself is the alphabet used in writing this poem; He is the letters used to make up the words that compose this poem. Just as all poetry is composed of words written with letters of the alphabet, so also the church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed of God Himself as the letters.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul tells us that we are the letters of Christ (2 Cor. 3:3). As one who was a pattern for living Christ for the church, Paul was competent to write living letters of Christ as the heavenly, spiritual alphabet. He was qualified, and he had a mastery of the skill necessary for this.</p>
<p>We are not letters in ourselves; rather, we are letters in Christ. As He is an Alpha, so we are an alpha. As He is an Omega, so we are an omega. He is every letter of the alphabet for the dispensing of life. He is inexhaustible, and His dispensing of life is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet. An English-language typewriter has twenty-six letters. With these letters we can compose any word, sentence, paragraph, or book. Christ is the real typewriter containing all the letters from alpha to omega. Whenever we want to say something, we simply need to type Christ. Day by day we must practice and become adept at typing with Christ as the letters.</p>
<p>We should learn to compose something with the Triune God as letters, and we should become accustomed to using these heavenly letters. We need to learn to write with these letters, realizing that the New Testament actually is composed of God Himself. The Triune God is every letter of the alphabet used in writing the New Testament. In ministering the Word of God, we need to apply the Triune God as the letters of the spiritual alphabet. Every aspect of the church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed with the Triune God as the alphabet.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Start and the Completion</h2>
<p>As the Alpha and the Omega, He is the start and the completion. At the end of the Bible He declares Himself to be not only the Alpha but also the Omega, meaning that once He begins something, He will complete it regardless of all the frustrations. We should not, therefore, be disappointed. When we look at the condition of the church today, we may say that it is a mess. How can God accomplish His purpose with such a situation? However, we must remember that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. He will complete what He has begun. All that is unveiled in Revelation 21 and 22 will eventually come to pass, because Christ is the Alpha and the Omega.</p>
<p>Christ is the first letter, the last letter, and all the letters in between. This means that He is able and qualified to accomplish all that is spoken concerning Him in Revelation. We should not excuse ourselves, thinking that the visions in this book are too high for us and that we cannot attain them. The Lord is the Alpha and the Omega to back up and to carry out His word. We must exercise our entire being to believe in His word. We should not look at, reckon, or consider ourselves. We are nothing. If we look at ourselves, we will not be able to do anything. Therefore, we must turn our eyes to Him, set our eyes upon Him, and believe in His word. No matter how far beyond us His word is, we must say Amen to whatever He says. Whenever we say Amen to His word, we are strengthened, and we have living faith. Faith is not derived from us; it originates with Him. If we look away from all things unto Him (Heb. 12:2), we will enjoy Him as our Alpha, our Omega, and our everything. He will certainly accomplish everything He has promised in Revelation. We only need to exercise faith in Him.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks something about the church in the first book of the New Testament, and then in the last book, as a consummation of the whole Bible, He speaks to the churches about the church. The book of Revelation is not written to individuals but to the local churches (1:11). The Lord Jesus never forgets what He begins. We may forget, but He never forgets. In the first book of the New Testament, He spoke about the building of the church (Matt. 16:18), and what He has begun, He will accomplish. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, to accomplish the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) The Author and Perfecter of Our Faith</h2>
<p>As the Alpha and the Omega, Christ is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). Faith is the way to enjoy God, but we do not have faith in ourselves. Our faith can last only a short time. But Christ is the Author, the Originator, and the Perfecter of our faith. This means that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the ending, of our faith. In other words, He is our faith, and this faith lasts forever. If we feel that our faith is weak, we should call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. After calling upon His name, we will have faith within us. Faith is nothing less than Christ Himself. When we have Him, we have faith, and this faith is for God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Complete Content and Continuation</h2>
<p>Christ, the Son of God, is the First and the Last (Rev. 1:17; 2:8; 22:13), the Beginning and the End (v. 13), and the Alpha and the Omega (v. 13). Being the first simply means that prior to us there was nothing. However, for us to be the beginning means not only that we are the first but also that we have begun something. What then is the difference between the Alpha and the Beginning? A certain thing may be the beginning, but it may have neither the content nor the continuation. To be the Alpha and the Omega is to be the complete content and continuation. In order to be the beginning and the ending, we must take a certain action. Christ is not only the First but also the Beginning, the beginning of God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s operation. God&rsquo;s operation began and will end with Christ. This Christ is also the content and continuation of God&rsquo;s operation, because He is not only the Beginning and the End but also the Alpha and the Omega. In other words, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is everything. He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End of God&rsquo;s operation, and the content and continuation of whatever God is doing. Christ is all-inclusive, and Christ is everything.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The First and the Last, the Beginning and the End</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The First and the Last</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:13 also tells us that Christ is the First and the Last. As the Alpha, He is the First, and as the Omega, He is the Last. As to the First, Christ is the foremost; as to the Last, Christ is the hindmost. He is always the First; no one precedes Him. He is also the Last; no one is behind Him.</p>
<p>The Lord told the church in Smyrna, the suffering church, that He is the First and the Last (2:8). This means that no matter how great the sufferings through which He passed were, those sufferings could not terminate or damage Him. He is the First, and eventually He is also the Last. In suffering, the church must know that the Lord is the First and the Last, the ever-existing, unchanging One. Whatever the environment may be, He remains the same. Nothing can precede Him nor can anything exist after Him. All things are within the limit of His control.</p>
<p>When the Lord told the church in Smyrna that He is the First and the Last, He was also indicating that the church had to be victorious. The church should not be frustrated by any kind of suffering. She must pass through all the sufferings and come to the end, because the Lord, who is the life and Head of the church, is the First and the Last.</p>
<p>In the apostle John&rsquo;s writings, he touches the divine things. With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending. John had an intention to show us that whatever he ministered to us is eternal, with no beginning and no ending. In Revelation John told us that Christ is the eternal One, the First and the Last (2:8; 22:13b). Because He is the First, no one and nothing is before Him. Because He is the Last, no one and nothing is after Him. This indicates that He is everything. Christ as the eternal One may be illustrated by a circle, which has no beginning and no ending. Christ occupies everything and every place. He does not give us any position. We are nothing, and He is everything. He is the First and the Last for the dispensing of the divine life into us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) The Beginning and the End</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is not only the First but also the Beginning; He is not only the Last but also the End. <em>The First</em> indicates that none is before Christ, and <em>the Last</em> that none is after Him; whereas <em>the Beginning</em> indicates that He is the origination of all things, and <em>the End</em> that He is the consummation of all things. Hence, the indication here is not only that there is nothing before or after the Lord Jesus but also that there is no origination or consummation without Him. This assures us that the Lord is strong to promise, encourage, and strengthen us. He will accomplish whatever He has spoken in Revelation.</p>
<p>As the Beginning, nothing precedes Christ, and as the End, nothing succeeds Him. This means that before Christ and after Christ there is no other. Christ is everything. We must experience such a Christ in a full way, all the way from Alpha to Omega. Before Alpha there is no letter, and after Omega there is also no letter. The Alpha is the beginning, and the Omega is the end.</p>
<p>We can be the first, but we may not be the originator. We can also be the last, but we may not be the finisher. Christ is not only the First but also the Originator; He is not only the Last but also the Finisher. In other words, in this universe from beginning to end, all is Christ. We may be the first but not the origination; we may be the last but not the completion. The Lord Jesus is not only the First but also the Beginning, the origination; He is not only the Last but also the End, the completion, leaving nothing to anyone. He occupies the entire universe. In time, in space, and in everything He is everything. He is the Beginning and the End, the origination and the completion.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is not only the First and the Last but also the Beginning and the End assures us that, having started the church life, He will surely accomplish it. He will never leave His work unfinished. All those in the local churches must believe that the Lord Jesus is the Beginning and the End. He will accomplish what He has begun in His recovery.</p>
<p>Because the Lord is everything to us and because He is so strong, we should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are weak and that our environment is too difficult. The more difficult our environment, the richer the Lord will be to us. The more trying our circumstances, the stronger the Lord will be to us. We must exercise our faith in this all-inclusive One, the One who is the Alpha, the Omega, the First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End. With Him, there are no problems. Thus, we need to be immersed into Him, believe in Him, and rest in Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(32)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Alpha and Omega.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jesus, the Root and the Offspring of David,<br />
the Bright Morning Star</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the Root and the Offspring of David.&rdquo; In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David; in His humanity, Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David. Hence, He is the Lord as the Root of David, and He is also the son, the shoot, of David as the Offspring of David (Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Jer. 23:5). Just as <em>the Offspring of David</em> denotes that the Lord is man and that He came out of David, so also <em>the Root of David</em> denotes that He is God and that David came out of Him. This reveals the two natures of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, in Revelation 22:16 Christ Himself acknowledged that He is man as well as God.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly reveals to us that our Lord is God as well as man, the true God and the true man, the perfect God and the perfect man. He is nothing less than God and nothing less than man, having complete divinity and complete humanity. He is God with the divine nature, and He is also man with a human nature. The Gospel of John continually shows us these two aspects of Him. He is God who knows everything and sees everything (1:47-48), who is omnipresent, and who descended out of heaven yet is still in heaven (3:13). He is a man who can become weary and thirsty (4:6-7). He can also weep (11:35). Both God and man are complete in Him. This is really mysterious. It is no wonder that His name is called &ldquo;Wonderful&rdquo; (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>In Revelation 22:16 the Lord declared that He is &ldquo;the bright morning star.&rdquo; At His coming back, Christ will be the rising sun to His people generally (Mal. 4:2) but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly. The latter will be a reward to the overcomers (Rev. 2:28). Christ as the Root and Offspring of David is related to Israel and the kingdom, whereas His being the bright morning star is related to the church and the rapture. The morning star appears before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn. The great tribulation will be this darkest time, after which the day of the kingdom will dawn. In the kingdom the Lord will appear publicly to His people as the sun, but before the great tribulation He will appear privately to His overcomers as the morning star to rapture them. The bright morning star will appear only to the watchful ones. The slumbering believers will not see the morning star; they will see Christ only as the sun in a general way.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. His Coming Quickly, and His Reward Being with Him<br />
to Render to Each One of the Saints<br />
according to His Work</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) His Coming Quickly</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly.&rdquo; In verse 20 the Lord also said, &ldquo;Yes, I come quickly.&rdquo; Our loving response should be, &ldquo;Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (22:20; 2 Tim. 4:8). We may express our desire for the Lord&rsquo;s return in the way of a prayer to Him, saying, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; We should always call for His coming. This becomes our response to His return. Since we know that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is so precious, we should love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. We must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You, and I love Your appearing. Because I love You, I love Your appearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the record in the New Testament, it is not difficult to discover that in their hearts the apostles firmly believed that the Lord would come quickly and that they also lived a life in preparation for the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. This is like the situation in which some long-separated relatives are soon to return. The entire family is prepared to welcome them. It is also like a girl waiting to be married, who knows of the wedding day and who is waiting wholeheartedly for that day to arrive. Paul was one who had such an attitude. The life he lived was a life of waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s return. We can see this by reading 1 Thessalonians. This book has five chapters, each of which concludes with the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. This indicates that Paul was one who loved the Lord&rsquo;s appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). Taking Paul as our pattern, we should love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing.</p>
<p>Since we love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, we should earnestly wait for His coming (Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10). Hence, our future is with Him. Our living should indicate that we have no other hope on earth. Our hope is in the coming Lord. He is our eternal destiny. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul says, &ldquo;Brothers, the time is shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away&rdquo; (vv. 29-31). Christ is our real hope.</p>
<p>While waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s return, we should learn to fear Him. In Luke 12 the Lord gave a parable concerning a rich man who endeavored to lay up wealth for himself so that his soul might enjoy itself and be merry. But God said to him, &ldquo;Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you&rdquo; (v. 20). Every &ldquo;today&rdquo; that we have is truly the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Therefore, as long as we have today, as long as we still have breath, we should love the Lord and His appearing, await the Lord&rsquo;s coming (Phil. 3:20), and always take His coming as an encouragement.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, &ldquo;I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.&rdquo; This is an exhortation from Paul immediately before his martyrdom. He says that he had fought the good fight, finished the course, and kept the faith, and that at the judgment seat he would be awarded the crown of righteousness, which would be awarded to all those who have loved His appearing (vv. 6-8). He reminded Timothy that by the Lord&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom we should have a living that loves the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. This is also a reminder to us, and this will cause us not to be discouraged, not to backslide, and not to become weak but to remain faithful to the end.</p>
<p>At the end of the first century, the Lord said, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly,&rdquo; (Rev. 22:12) so that we would consider His reward to be rendered at His coming back. This is the Lord&rsquo;s warning. If we take heed to this warning, we will be blessed; otherwise, we will forfeit the blessing. We should not think that because the Lord has been tolerating the situation for more than nineteen centuries, He is slow to come back. We need to look at the world situation today. We do not know what will happen within the next few days. In this age things happen very quickly. Therefore, we must pray and be watchful. We must also be prepared in spirit and in our daily life. May the Lord cover us so that we may be a watchful, praying, and prepared people.</p>
<p>The Lord has still not come, because He does not yet have what He desires. He is after a Body to express Him and a dear bride to satisfy His heart. When the Lord said that He would come soon, He spoke according to His sense of time, not according to ours. The point here is that God is working slowly to dispense Himself into us. We need to see that the quicker our life matures, the sooner the Lord will return. If we require a longer time to mature in life, the Lord will return later.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not only judge the negative things but also receive His bride. This means that He will come both as the Judge and as the Bridegroom. Hence, in order for the Lord to come as the Bridegroom, the bride must be prepared for Him. Is the bride ready for the Bridegroom&rsquo;s coming? Is it possible for the Lord to come today as the Bridegroom? Because the bride is not yet ready, we may say that it is possible that the Lord&rsquo;s coming will not be as soon as some expect.</p>
<p>The principle here is that the higher the life is, the slower it grows. For example, mushrooms and mosquitoes, being rather low forms of life, grow quickly. But it takes at least twenty-one years for a human being to reach maturity. The bride must be prepared for the Bridegroom, and this preparation is through the growth in life, a growth that requires time. Instead of blaming the Lord for delaying His coming, we should be diligent to prepare ourselves to meet Him. We should also minister life to others so that they may grow and be prepared. This is the only way to hasten the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>Only the lazy, idle servant says, &ldquo;My master delays&rdquo; (Matt. 24:48b). The Lord, however, is hastening His coming, and it will not be long before the church age is ended. We must see that the church is the Body of Christ. Unless there is a substantial expression of the Body, the Lord Jesus will not return. The Lord has not yet returned, because the Body has not yet been manifested on the earth.</p>
<p>The reality of living in the Body of Christ is the divine fellowship. The Lord has been frustrated throughout the centuries because of the lack of fellowship. The Lord has not come back because the believers are individualistic, independent, opinionated, and divisive. The Roman Catholic Church controlled people by its organization, but those who broke away from Catholicism brought in division after division. The believers are like unbridled horses. Today nothing seems to control them. Actually, the divine fellowship should control the believers. The one thing that should rule us is the divine fellowship. We should be restricted in this fellowship. By being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness, and the work of the ministry continues to advance. The Lord has not returned because it will be a shame for Him to come back without having a real building. There must be a remnant that will respond to the Lord&rsquo;s heart and be willing to lose their individualism in order to be built up together as one Body.</p><h2 class="head5">2) His Reward Being with Him<br />
to Render to Each One As His Work Is</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:12 the Lord says, &ldquo;My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;reward&rdquo; in this verse means &ldquo;wages.&rdquo; At the Lord&rsquo;s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers after their rapture at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 14:10; Matt. 16:27).</p>
<p>When He comes again to possess the kingdom, the Lord will reward or punish all those who belong to Him. Some will receive His punishment because the Lord&rsquo;s word &ldquo;My reward is with Me&rdquo; implies that there is not only reward but also punishment. In keeping with this, in Revelation 22:7 the Lord declared, &ldquo;I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll.&rdquo; He who keeps the words of the prophecy of Revelation is blessed because he will be rewarded. The reward we receive on that day has much to do with our attitude today. First Corinthians 3:8 says that we will be rewarded according to our labor. In Matthew 16:27 the Lord Jesus said that at His coming back He will reward us according to our doings. Eternal salvation has nothing to do with our works, but the kingdom reward will be altogether according to our works that we have done by the Lord&rsquo;s life after being saved.</p>
<p>Every saved one will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad; those who practice good will receive a reward, and those who practice evil will receive punishment (2 Cor. 5:10). We will stand before the judgment seat and give the Lord an account concerning all of our past living, walk, and conduct. It is because of this that even the apostle Paul says that he dared not examine himself, but He who examined him was the Lord (1 Cor. 4:3-4). He says, &ldquo;Do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God&rdquo; (v. 5).</p>
<p>As we live on earth, it is not sufficient for us to merely have a conscience without offense; the Lord must still judge the way we serve Him. According to Matthew 25, we may not have received two talents or five, but we have all received at least one talent, at least one spiritual gift, from the Lord. We cannot say that we are not saved, that we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s life, or that we do not have the Holy Spirit. We have all these things. As a result of our having received these things, we have at least one talent, and we must use this talent properly and gain a profit for the Lord (vv. 14-30).</p>
<p>The Bible shows that after the one who received five talents gained another five talents, the master said to him, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (v. 23). The one who received two talents likewise gained another two talents. They both served the master faithfully and used their gifts to the fullest extent. In the same way, when we use the life, the Holy Spirit, and the talent we have received from the Lord, there will be a full result.</p>
<p>We should never think that once we are saved, we will have no problems. We should not think that as long as we do not do anything contrary to our conscience, we will be void of offense toward both God and man, nor should we think that as long as our conduct is perfect, we will have no problems. Actually, the way we serve and work for the Lord after we are saved is a great matter. In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul says, &ldquo;Let each man take heed how he builds&rdquo; (v. 10b). This means that we must all take heed concerning our work. We may build with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble. One day the nature of our work in our service to the Lord will be tested by fire. If we have built with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will immediately be consumed when it passes through the fire. Only the work that is of gold, silver, and precious stones will remain. Hence, Paul says, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward&rdquo; (v. 14). Apart from salvation, there is also the matter of reward. Therefore, it is not that if we work well, we are saved. The matter of salvation has already been resolved, but the matter of reward is an issue that has not yet been resolved. It depends on how we serve the Lord after we are saved.</p>
<p>If our work for the Lord is of gold, silver, and precious stones, we will receive a reward; if it is of wood, grass, and stubble, we will suffer loss (v. 15a). Some think that to suffer loss is to lose one&rsquo;s salvation, that is, to perish. The truth, however, is that we will still be saved, &ldquo;yet so as through fire&rdquo; (v. 15b). Hence, we must not think that once we are saved, we will have no problems. After we are saved, there are still great issues to take care of. Our conduct is an issue, and our work also is an issue. When the Lord comes back, there will be a judgment. In that judgment He will determine whether we will receive a reward or punishment.</p>
<p>This reward will be decided by the judgment seat of Christ. Second Corinthians 5:10 says, &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; The judgment seat of Christ will be set up at His coming back. The unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne a thousand years later (Rev. 20:11-15), but the Lord Jesus will judge all His believers at the judgment seat. There, the decision will be made regarding what reward they will receive&mdash;the enjoyment in the coming kingdom or some punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. His Grace Being with All the Saints</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:21 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&rdquo; After seeing all the visions and hearing all the prophecies in Revelation, we still need the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Only the grace of the Lord Jesus can enable us to live and walk according to these visions and prophecies. Not only this book but also the entire Bible closes with this grace, the grace that enables us to experience the all-inclusive Christ and participate in the Triune God that we may become His eternal corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, that He and we may enjoy absolute satisfaction and complete rest mutually for eternity.</p>
<p>Many Bible readers know and can recite the first sentence of the Bible: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). But not many know the concluding word of the Bible. <em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth</em> is objective to us. But <em>the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints</em> is subjective to us. We need to pray-read this concluding verse of the Bible. The grace of the Lord must be with each one of us in every aspect of our daily life because we are saints. The New Jerusalem is the base upon which the grace of the Lord Jesus is with all the saints for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God. The Lord&rsquo;s grace being with us is based upon all the particular aspects of the New Jerusalem. With the New Jerusalem as the base, the grace of the Lord Jesus is always with all the saints from the age of grace through the age of the kingdom to eternity for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God. This grace consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and eternal expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(33)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">B. Expressing Him</h2>
<p>In Revelation 21 and 22 we see that we may express Christ as the lamp of the city, the light-bearer, with the glory of God as the light within Him, by which light the nations will walk.</p>
<p>God is the light, and Christ the Son as the Lamb is the lamp. This lamp has God in it as the light. The city as the lampstand shines the light of God in the Lamb. This shining is expressed through the city, that is, through us. We are the expression of Christ, who has God in Him as the light, and this light, which is God Himself shining in Christ throughout the new city, saturates us. We are immersed in God Himself as the light, and we will be the expression of Christ with God as the light.</p>
<p>We need to see the contents of the New Jerusalem. First, the New Jerusalem has God&rsquo;s glory as the uncreated light and the Lamb as the lamp to shine forth the divine brightness through the entire city (21:23, 11; 22:5b). Here we can see three layers: God is the light, Christ is the lamp, and the church&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;is the lamp container. God as the light shines in the Lamb as the lamp, and the lamp is in the city. In this picture we can see the organic union. In the holy city God and Christ are organically united, and They and we are also united as one. Therefore, there is an organic union between us and God in Christ. The entire New Jerusalem will be a great organic union. The situation in the New Jerusalem is like that in the church today. The church is a lampstand to shine forth the Triune God as our testimony organically.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 and 22 reveal that God will not be alone for eternity but will be in Christ within the holy city. The New Jerusalem may be compared to a wheel, and God as the light within the Lamb as the lamp is the center and hub of the whole corporate entity. Throughout the ages God has been working in this direction toward this goal. God&rsquo;s purpose is altogether a matter of our being built together as a corporate entity to become the holy city. God as light shines from within the Lamb as the lamp through the city as the light-bearer to express Himself as the glory.</p>
<p>The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp shining through the New Jerusalem as the light&rsquo;s diffuser. This indicates that the Triune God is one with His redeemed in His expression shining as light over the nations. In the New Jerusalem there are the light, the lamp, and the diffuser to shine forth the divine light. In John 14:20 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; This shows that the light is in the lamp, and the lamp is in the diffuser. The light is God the Father, the lamp is God the Son, and the diffuser is the Body of Christ, the New Jerusalem, to shine the divine light over the nations, the peoples who live around the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As the Lamp of the City&mdash;the Light-bearer</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:23 tells us that Christ as the Lamb is the lamp of the holy city. In the New Jerusalem gold symbolizes God&rsquo;s nature, and light refers to His divine shining. This shining is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp to hold the divine light for our benefit so that we may enjoy God as the shining One in the redeeming Christ. Revelation 21:11 indicates that God as the light shines through the New Jerusalem. This verse tells us that &ldquo;her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;light&rdquo; in this verse can also be translated &ldquo;luminary&rdquo; or &ldquo;light-bearer.&rdquo; The entire wall of the New Jerusalem is built with jasper (v. 18), and the light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper stone, bearing the appearance of God (4:3) to express Him by her shining. God in the redeeming Lamb is the light, and the city is a luminary, a great light-bearer. This means that God as the divine light shines within and through the redeeming Christ, and this shining enlightens the entire city. Then the entire city becomes a light-bearer. This bearing of God&rsquo;s light becomes an expression, and this expression is God&rsquo;s goal. In the New Jerusalem God is light, and His shining is His glory. The shining is the coming out of the light. Hence, when God shines in the city, He is expressed in glory, first in and through Christ, and then in the city and through the saints. God is the light, Christ is the containing lamp, and the city&rsquo;s wall bears the divine light to express God. Today the believers as children of light (Eph. 5:8) are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14), shining in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation (Phil. 2:15). Eventually, the New Jerusalem as a composition of all the saints will be the light-bearer, shining forth God as light over the nations around her.</p>
<p>The brightness of the glory of the New Jerusalem is like a most precious stone. This precious stone is not the light but the light-bearer. It does not have light in itself, but the light, which is God, has been wrought into it and shines out through it. This indicates that as a part of the coming New Jerusalem, we must be transformed into precious stones with God wrought into our being as the shining light so that we may be the light-bearer to shine as God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>God shines in Christ through the city, since the whole city will be transparent because everyone in it will have been transformed. There is no more clay, nothing opaque; every bit of clay has been transformed into crystal-clear precious stones. God shines in Christ through the city, and all the nations will walk in this light. Then the whole universe will be headed up in the light shown through this transparent city.</p>
<p>We need to apply this picture to our daily life. Today we have God in the redeeming Christ shining within us, and we are being transformed to be transparent. In our old creation we are opaque, but in our new creation we are transparent. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. Eventually, we will have the appearance of jasper and will fully express the &ldquo;jasper God&rdquo; (Rev. 4:3).</p>
<p>A certain saint may be a very good person, but he may still be opaque because he remains very much in the old creation. Because of this, not much transformation has taken place in his being. However, when we are with another saint, we may sense that with him everything is transparent because he has experienced much transformation in life. Many times when we come to a certain brother, we cannot get any light. Our coming to another brother, however, may bring us into the light. Even before he begins to speak to us, we are in the light. When we are at home, we are in darkness, but when we come to this dear saint, our coming brings light to us. When we come to him, everything is clear, darkness is gone, and there is light. Opaqueness is over, and everything is transparent. We all need to be transformed to such an extent that we are full of light and transparent.</p>
<p>The entire city of the New Jerusalem is the diffuser, diffusing the divine light over the nations outside the city (21:24a). We are the diffusers to spread the light. God has spent at least six thousand years to build up a city, and this city needs the light. Without the light the city is in darkness. The illuminating light is God Himself in His glory contained in Christ as the lamp. This lamp is in a diffuser. Today this diffuser that spreads the divine light is the Body of Christ. Eventually, the entire New Jerusalem will be the diffuser of the divine light. All the nations around the city will be under this diffusing with God as the light of glory and Christ as the containing lamp.</p><h2 class="head3">2. With the Glory of God as the Light within Him</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:5 says that the Lord will shine upon His saints. In the future the unlimited glory of God will shine forth as light with Christ as the lamp in the New Jerusalem, signifying that Christ is the center of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for all eternity. Being illuminated by the Lord God is a blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. God Himself will shine upon us, and we will live under His illumination.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 21:11, the holy city has the glory of God. Here the glory of God is the expression of God, God expressed. When God is manifested, that is glory. We have been ordained for this glory and called to this glory (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12). We are being transformed into this glory (2 Cor. 3:18), and we will be brought into it (Heb. 2:10). Eventually, we will be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17, 30) to bear the glory of God for God&rsquo;s expression in the New Jerusalem. In the holy city both the lamp and the light refer to God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>The whole city of New Jerusalem is God. The light is God, its glory is the expression of God, and its appearance is God Himself revealed to the nations. All of this should be found in the church life today. The church is God&rsquo;s temple. God Himself in the church is our dwelling place, and He is also the light that shines out through us to our neighbors. This shining out is also the glory and appearance of the church. This is the church life.</p>
<p>When God completely finishes His work in the church, it will be a transparent city. All the gold in the New Jerusalem is transparent, transmitting the effulgence of God, so that by its light all things may arrive at the oneness. The light effaces death in all things and heads up all things. The city diffuses the light, shining upon the nations (Rev. 21:24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Nations to Walk<br />
by the Light of the Shining</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:24 tells us that the nations will walk by the light of the shining from the New Jerusalem. Even after the millennium the nations will live on the new earth as the peoples (vv. 3-4). These nations will have kings, who will bring their glory into the city. In eternity we the redeemed ones will be the royal family ruling over the nations.</p>
<p>The nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, an organic building. Thus, the entire eternal kingdom of God will be under the shining of God&rsquo;s glory in the Redeemer through the redeemed as the diffuser. The eternal kingdom of God includes the New Jerusalem and the nations around it. The redeemed who constitute the New Jerusalem are the kings to reign, and the nations around the New Jerusalem are the subjects.</p>
<p>In their relationship with God, the subjects will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem (v. 24a). For their human affairs they will live under the light of the sun created by God and the lamp made by man, but in matters related to God the nations as the subjects will walk in the divine light.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Holy City Being the Light of the Nations</h2>
<p>In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold (Isa. 30:26). I believe that in the new heaven and the new earth the light of the sun will be even brighter than this. Nevertheless, Revelation 21:24 says that the nations will walk in the light of the city. This proves that the light in the city will be stronger than the natural light. God will shine through the city, and this shining will be brighter than either the moon or the sun. Actually, the nations will not need to walk in the sunlight or in the moonlight, for they will walk in the shining of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s building, is a full picture of today&rsquo;s church life. If we are such a miniature of the holy city, we will shine forth with God as the light. Then the unbelievers, the worldly people, will walk in our light. We will enlighten everyone around us.</p>
<p>The church should be such a shining light today, and all our neighbors should walk in the light of our shining. Today the church is the light-bearer, bearing Christ as the light shining to this generation. We need to be such a shining church. There should be a difference between the church people and unbelievers, a difference not of some man-made designation but a difference because of our shining. We must shine so that the nations may walk in our light.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ. This will be the complete fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10, which says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; If Christ as life is not able to shine forth from the church to be the light of the nations, all the things of creation will have no way to be headed up in Him. When the nations walk by the light of the city, there will be no harm to men and no damage to things. At that time the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah (Isa. 11:9), and all things will be headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>Because God is the source of life, He recovers the oneness of the universe by entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life. First, He became a man, a part of &ldquo;all things&rdquo; which will be headed up in Christ. He then imparted His life into believers, making them the constituents of the church, and He works in them so that they can shine Him forth as light to all things. Through the shining, all things will walk in the light, be in one accord, and be headed up in Christ. Hence, the condition of oneness in the universe is altogether related to life and death, light and darkness.</p>
<p>At the top of the New Jerusalem, Christ is the Head with God in Him as the content. From Him flows the river of life with the tree of life to supply all His sons, and the redeemed ones as the sons of God are filled with life (Rev. 22:1-2). The whole city shines out this life as light, and the nations, representing the whole universe, walk in the light of this city. Because Christ is at the top of the city as the Head, all things are headed up in Christ through the Body, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. At that time the entire universe will be in harmony, and there will be no more death and, thus, no more darkness and no more confusion. Within, the city is full of life, and without, it is full of light. The whole environment surrounding the city will be under the regulation of this light. Then the entire universe will be headed up in Christ through the church. This will be the full manifestation of Christ being Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</p>
<p>From Christ as the Head at the top of the New Jerusalem flows the bountiful life to supply us all. We are filled with this life, and spontaneously we shine out this life as light to the whole environment. Then all the surrounding nations, representing the entire universe, walk in this light and are controlled under this light. Thus, they will have real harmony. All things will be headed up in Christ through the church. This is the consummation of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Within the city there is the life, but outside the city there is only the shining. All the nations are under the shining, but they do not have the life. The life is only in the city, and this life is God Himself imparted to all of His children. By this life they are full of light, and this light will shine through them to bring all creation out of darkness, confusion, and the bondage of corruption in vanity into the order of the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p>Even today this can be realized among us to some degree. When we are filled with Christ under His headship, light shines out of us, and others are under the enlightening of this light. This is a foretaste and a miniature of the coming consummation.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Light of Life Keeping Everything in Order</h2>
<p>The holy city will be illumined by the shining of God Himself. Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light.&rdquo; This reminds us of Isaiah 2:5, which says, &ldquo;House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.&rdquo; Light preserves oneness and rules out disorder. The light in the New Jerusalem will control, rule, guide, and keep everything in order. Hence, it will preserve the oneness.</p>
<p>Where life is, there light is also. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; This light is the light of life (8:12). In Revelation 21 we have both life and light. Because the New Jerusalem is saturated with light, it has no need for the light of the sun. In the New Jerusalem we will have the glory of the Triune God as our shining light. In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, there will be no night, no death, and no darkness. Instead, there will be life and light. This will cause everything to rise up and be in good order.</p>
<p>Life regulates, and light controls. In the church life we do not have regulations, but we do have the regulating life and the controlling light. When the church is full of life, it is also full of light. Then everyone in the church is regulated by the inward life, not by outward rules, and everyone is controlled and kept in order by the light of life. Here in life and in light, we are headed up. In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city (v. 24). This will cause the new heaven and the new earth to be a bright sphere. Therefore, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ, thereby fulfilling the heading up of all things in Christ spoken of in Ephesians 1:10.</p>
<p>In order for this to take place, we need the dispensing of life. The life that is dispensed into us eventually becomes the light of men. In the dispensation of the fullness of the times, all the nations will walk in the light of the city. This means that there will be no death, no darkness, no corruption, and no confusion. Instead, everything will be in order, headed up under Christ, the unique Head, to express the Triune God in eternity. This heading up of all things will be an eternal expression of the Triune God. Today&rsquo;s church life is a foretaste of this. It is a miniature of the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem. As those in the miniature, we are enjoying the dispensing of life with light, and we are being headed up in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. All Things Being Headed Up<br />
through the Church and for the Church</h2>
<p>God needs a group of people who live in His life and allow His life to shine forth from them in order to bring all things into the light of life to be headed up in Christ. Even though God&rsquo;s life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness. When the life of the Head passes through the church, His Body, and reaches all things, all things become headed up in Christ. Where there is the life of the Head, there is the authority of the Head and also oneness.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 speaks of the heading up of all things, and 4:13 speaks of the church arriving at the oneness. The church arrives at the oneness, and then all things are headed up. When the church arrives at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, all things will be headed up, the church will become transparent, and the light of life within the church will be fully diffused. The light that is diffused shines on all things in order that all things may be in the light. In this way all things are headed up.</p>
<p>Romans 8 shows that the church has not yet arrived at the oneness, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory. All things are still subject to vanity and are groaning and travailing due to the slavery of corruption (vv. 20-22). Their being subject to vanity proves that all things are not in oneness. However, when the sons of God enter into the freedom of glory, there will be harmony without any struggle, friction, slavery, vanity, corruption, groaning, or travailing. This will be the genuine oneness. Moreover, when the New Jerusalem is expressed, the life within her will shine forth, and the nations will walk by her light. At that time, no one will go astray, walk on the wrong way, or stand on the wrong position. Everyone will be in his own position, walk on the proper way, and be absolutely one. All things will be headed up and in oneness.</p>
<p>God Himself is the life of the church. God&rsquo;s life operates in the church and shines forth from the church to be light to the nations; this is how He heads up all things. Hence, the heading up of all things is through the church. When we have God in Christ as life to us, life becomes the shining light. Eventually the entire environment, the whole universe, will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:11, 23-24). Under the control of this light, the whole universe, the whole of creation, will be in harmony.</p><h2 class="head4">d. All Creation Being Brought into Order<br />
under the Shining of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is composed of many members, represented by the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles (vv. 12, 14), but they all are one. All the arguing, debating, and fighting will have been swallowed up by life and light. Death will be entirely swallowed up, and all darkness will be chased away by light. Therefore, everyone in the New Jerusalem will be wholly in oneness.</p>
<p>Today, physically speaking, millions of people are walking under the sun by day and under electrical light by night, but spiritually speaking, they are walking in darkness. Yet for eternity in the New Jerusalem the nations will walk in the light of the holy city. God will work out such a city. One day the New Jerusalem will be completed with God shining through this city upon all the rest of creation. This is the age in which God is working to save people and build them up to produce the New Jerusalem as the universal lampstand that holds Christ as the lamp with God within Him as the light. God will shine on all creation through this universal lampstand, and by this shining, this enlightening, God will bring all things into order. All creation will be brought into the order of the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p>God has a process to carry out. He has much work to do in the church. He needs to work Himself into us as life so that we may be full of light and be controlled by this light. Then we will have the oneness, the harmony, and this will be the real building up. It is by this building that God will shine out and shine upon all creation to bring them out of confusion, the slavery of corruption, and vanity. That time will be the fullness of the times. It will be the time that all creation will be liberated, because death will have been swallowed up. After the end of the coming millennial kingdom, the ancient serpent and death will be cast into the lake of fire (20:10, 14). Death will be the last enemy to be dealt with by God (1 Cor. 15:26, 54). After death is dealt with, the universe will be full of light. Under this light all creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption and liberated from vanity and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God, which is the shining of the New Jerusalem. The shining of the New Jerusalem is the manifestation, the glory, of the sons of God. All the nations will be brought into this shining, and they will walk in this light and be controlled by this light. There will be no more confusion; hence, there will be no more vanity and slavery of corruption. Creation will be completely released from the slavery of corruption and will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the holy city.</p>
<p>All this depends on the work of God within and through us. God must work out this city as a corporate vessel that He may be life in every way to us and shine through us as light upon the whole creation. Today God is working Himself into us as life. Therefore, we need to be dealt with, and we need to be permeated and saturated with God. Then we will be full of light, and under this light we will be controlled, have oneness and harmony, be built up, and become the universal vessel through which God will head up all things under the shining of His Body.</p>
<p>God must first work in the church until the church is full of life inwardly and is entirely subject to the Head. Then the church will be one and will arrive at the oneness (Eph. 4:13). After God has worked thoroughly in the church, the restoration of all things will begin. God&rsquo;s work begins with the church and then spreads outward, passing through the church to all things. The church arrives at the oneness through the church&rsquo;s arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God. All things will be enlightened by the light that shines out through the oneness of the church, all will know Jehovah in the light of the oneness of the church (cf. Isa. 11:9), and all will be brought under the Head to arrive at the oneness.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 we see that God placed the city in the center of the new universe so that the nations might walk by its light (v. 24). Without the city, the nations would be in darkness. Being in darkness is equivalent to being in death. Darkness is always a sign of death; moreover, being in death is to be void of oneness. When the nations walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, all things are one in the light of the city. Isaiah 2:5 says, &ldquo;House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah,&rdquo; and 11:9 says, &ldquo;The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.&rdquo; The knowledge of Jehovah is light, and light brings everyone into oneness.</p>
<p>If a brother is full of Christ, through this brother&rsquo;s presence in his home, the light of life will shine forth and enlighten the entire home, enabling others to walk by his light. The light of life from within him will dispel the darkness in his home, and the power of life within him will swallow up any death. Even if the brothers have opinions and are fleshly and the sisters are not in harmony because of their tempers, this one brother&rsquo;s presence will be as the shining of the New Jerusalem and will eliminate all the quarrels and disharmony. The flesh will not be able to operate, and tempers will not flare up. As a result of his shining, his entire family will walk in the light. Everyone will be in one accord and headed up. This is how God works to bring the entire home into the light.</p>
<p>When life has completely finished its work in the church, the church will be the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s light will then shine forth through the New Jerusalem, bringing all things into the light. At that time darkness will be dispelled and death will have no place. The life of God is in the church and shines forth from the church. Eventually, the nations will walk by the light of life, which the church has received; however, the universe itself will not receive the life of God. Today in the church, the condition of some brothers and sisters may be compared to the center of the new universe, the New Jerusalem, which shines forth the life of God, but the condition of others may be compared to the surrounding nations, which receive the shining and influence of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Every one of us in the church is responsible for allowing the Lord to work and shine in us and to be diffused through us. For us to be mature in life, we must let the cross break us, provide God the opportunity to deal with us, and allow Christ&rsquo;s life to have the ground in us. Only when Christ is able to diffuse Himself out through us will we be mature. In that day the nations will walk by our light and be brought under the authority of God through our shining. At that time, all things will be headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:23 is a clear picture of the centrality and universality of Christ. God shines in and through Christ, and Christ shines in and through the New Jerusalem. By this, Christ will be the centrality and universality in the coming eternity, when Christ will be the center, the circumference, and everything in the New Jerusalem.</p></body></html>
