   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE GOD S DEALING WITH THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Exo 16:1-4, 8-13a; Num 11:1-6, 10-23, 31-34</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Exodus presents a picture of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God s salvation two matters are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is that God wants to be everything to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wants to work Himself into those whom He has predestinated unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, since God wants to be everything to us, He does not want us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, He wants to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we apply these two matters to the book of Exodus, we see that it was God Himself who dealt with Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God did not ask the children of Israel to fight in order to be released from Egyptian tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God did everything to bring about the total defeat of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Moses confronted Pharaoh, all he had was a rod, a dead stick.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was God who did everything for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider what God did for His people within less than forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He sent the plagues upon the Egyptians, and on the night of the Passover He slew the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He delivered the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh and brought them through the Red Sea, in which the Egyptian army was drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, God brought the people to Marah, where He changed the bitter water into sweet water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He led them onward to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. THE PEOPLE S GREEDY LUST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to 16:1, the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin...on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Passover was on the fourteenth day of the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the record of chapter sixteen describes what took place just thirty-one days after the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I first realized this, I was very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During this short period of time, God s people had seen a number of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, they were not adequately impressed with the Lord s sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Passover was a great event, and the crossing of the Red Sea was even greater.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the experiences at Marah and at Elim were significant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, when the people came to the wilderness of Sin and murmured and lusted after the fleshpots of Egypt, it seems as if they had had no experience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not many readers of Exodus have given adequate attention to chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually this chapter is greater than either chapter twelve or chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter twelve we have the Passover, in chapter fourteen the crossing of the Red Sea, and in chapter sixteen the eating of the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The eating of manna signifies that God s people had reached the point where they had begun to be a heavenly people, a people whose nature had begun to be transformed with the heavenly element.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of the miracles in the Scriptures were carried out with the physical things of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, the Lord Jesus fed the multitude with loaves and fishes Matt 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But can we say that the manna in chapter sixteen was an item of God s old creation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No scholar can tell us what was the substance or element of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever the substance of manna was, surely it did not belong to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God s old creation there is no such thing as manna.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter sixteen there are two miracles: the sending of the quails and the sending of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The quails belong to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A wind went forth from the Lord and brought quails Num 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was no doubt a miracle, but it made use of natural and physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sending of the manna, however, was different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Manna came from heaven Exo 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we know that manna came from heaven, we do not know what the element of manna was.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot say what was the essence of manna, but we do know that it was food of a category different from all earthly food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To partake of manna was to have a heavenly diet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This heavenly food did not belong to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>People invariably live according to what they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, if we eat a great deal of fish, we shall become a composition of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Day by day for a period of forty years, the children of Israel ate manna.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, they became constituted with manna.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may even say that they became manna.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although we do not know the essence of manna, we know that it was the kind of food that caused people to become heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By eating such heavenly food we become heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By giving His people manna to eat, God indicated that His intention was to change the nature of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wanted to change their being, their very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They had already undergone a change of location.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Formerly they were in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now they were with the Lord in the wilderness, a place of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, it is not sufficient merely to have a change of location, for this is too outward and too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There must also be an inward, subjective change, a change of life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way for God to produce such a change in His people is by changing their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By eating Egyptian food God s people had been constituted with the element of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The element of the world had become their composition.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When they were in Egypt, they did not partake of anything heavenly, for everything they ate was according to the Egyptian diet and was Egyptian in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although God s people had been brought out of Egypt into the wilderness of separation, they were still constituted with the element of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now God s intention was to change their element by changing their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He did not want them to eat anything that came from a worldly source.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They were no longer allowed to eat Egyptian food.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God wanted to feed them with food from heaven in order to constitute them with the heavenly element.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His desire was to fill them, to satisfy them, to saturate them with food from heaven, and thereby to make them a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Before God sent manna from heaven, He sent the quails 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The quails caused the people to be even more fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The nature and substance of the quails corresponded to the nature and substance of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Manna, however, did not, for it was of another category, of another kingdom and realm.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, by sending manna God showed that His intention was to change the composition of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is not satisfied with a mere change of place.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There must also be a change of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We, God s people today, are a composition of earthly things, a composition of the Egyptian element.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, God s goal is not simply to change our behavior; it is to change our inward being, the very inner fabric of our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although we have been constituted with the substance of Egypt, God intends to constitute us with a heavenly element.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is vital for all of us to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God knew that the children of Israel were in need of food.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If they had had faith in the Lord, they would have encouraged one another simply to rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They would have said, Our God knows our need.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is no need to murmur or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Let us trust in Him and be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Remember what the Lord has done for us in recent days.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He dealt with Pharaoh, He slew the firstborn, He defeated the Egyptians, He brought us through the Red Sea, and He has supplied our every need.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But instead of exercising faith in the Lord, the children of Israel seemingly forgot everything the Lord had done for them.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Instead of praising Him and thanking Him for what He had done, they murmured and complained.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Their words were sharp and ugly as they spoke to Moses: Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into the wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger 16:3, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even Moses was touched by the people s murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is proved by the fact that Moses said, What are we, that ye murmur against us?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In uttering this word, Moses was not victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To the contrary, this was a sign that he had been defeated, having been touched by the murmurings of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If I had been Moses, I would have spoken a much stronger word.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I might have said, Have you forgotten everything I have done for you?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You remember the fleshpots, but you don t recall the tyranny, the labor, and the sufferings in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I brought you out of that tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Why do you murmur against me?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Compared to us, Moses was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Nevertheless, he was not victorious in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We have pointed out that in His salvation God intends to be everything to us and to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is real, living, faithful, and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Because God has a purpose in His salvation, there is no need for us to beg Him to have mercy upon us and to rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God is working for us, and He knows all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we know the Lord and His ways, we shall not complain or murmur whenever we have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Instead, we shall say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He knows our every need.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If He wants us to miss a meal, then let us have a fast with praising and rejoicing before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Even if He withholds food for several days, we shall still rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He knows our need, and He will send the supply at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If He chooses for us to fast instead of feast, let us still praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He knows what is best for us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Let us accept with rejoicing whatever He gives us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If this had been the attitude of the children of Israel, God would not have sent the quails.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He would simply have sent manna early the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>His purpose in sending manna was to change the constitution of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Manna produces a metabolic change in which the Egyptian element is replaced by the heavenly element.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Such a heavenly metabolism causes God s people to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In name, the children of Israel were not Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But in nature and in composition they did not differ from the Egyptians in the least.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>By giving the people manna God seemed to be saying, I have rescued you from Egypt positionally, but you have not yet been changed dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Now I shall change your constitution by changing your diet from an Egyptian diet to a heavenly diet.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In this way I shall change your nature and your being, and I shall constitute you into a peculiar people.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Because I want you to be heavenly, I shall not feed you with anything which has its source in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Day by day, I shall send heavenly food, food from My dwelling place in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This food will change your constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>May we all see that God s intention in His salvation is to work Himself into us and to change our constitution by feeding us with heavenly food.</S>
