<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Enosh Calling on the Name of Jehovah<br>for His Rich Supply</H2><P>The name Enosh means fragile. Enosh, a fragile man, called on the name of Jehovah for His rich supply (Gen. 4:26). Enosh was weak, frail, and fragile. By calling on Jehovah's rich name, this fragile man received His rich supply. This certainly is something of the divine economy. Today we also practice calling on the name of the Lord. This practice began with the third generation of mankind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Enoch Walking with God<br>and Being Taken Away by God</H2><P>Enoch walked with God and was taken away by God (Gen. 5:21-24). Although man became fallen and was driven out of the garden of Eden, a fallen man could still walk with God and eventually could be taken away to God. This also is something of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Noah Walking with God<br>and Preparing the Ark<br>for the Carrying Out of the Divine Economy</H2><P>Noah not only walked with God but also prepared an ark for the carrying out of the divine economy (Gen. 6:8-22). The ark typified Christ and was for the salvation of humankind. The human race was saved through the ark prepared by Noah according to God's revelation and instruction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Noah Building an Altar<br>and Offering Burnt Offerings to God<br>to Please Him</H2><P>According to Genesis 8:20-22, Noah built an altar and offered burnt offerings (typifying Christ) to God to please Him so that the earth could be kept in its systems. Today we also should build an altar and pray; that is, we should come to the cross and offer Christ to God. As we offer Christ to God, we should pray, "O God, forgive our country. The immorality and chaos are offenses to You, the righteous God. We ask You to remember the cross on which Your Son, our Lord Jesus, died." To come to the cross and offer Christ to God is the divine economy. If we do this, we may help to save the country in which we live.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Cain Rejecting God's Promise<br>and Killing His Brother Abel</H2><P>It is likely that Adam had many sons, but only two, Abel and Cain, are used in the Bible as models. Abel is a model of the divine economy, and Cain is a model of the satanic chaos.</P><P>Cain rejected God's promise and killed his brother Abel, bringing in God's judgment and curse (Gen. 4:3-16). Instead of offering something of the flock, typifying Christ, he offered the result of his own labor, and that offended God. Nothing of a sinner's own labor that is offered to the righteous God will be accepted by Him.</P><P>By offering the result of his labor to God, Cain was seemingly doing a good thing. But shortly after his offering was rejected by God, Cain did something evil&#151;he killed his brother. With him there were both good and evil, indicating that he surely belonged to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The situation is the same in human society today. On the one hand, a gentleman does many good things; on the other hand, the same person does evil things.</P>
