   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have to pay special attention to the binding prayer and loosing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to bind many things, and we have to loose many things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not begging but binding and loosing with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May God be gracious to us so that all of us can learn to pray with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only do we have to learn to pray, we also have to learn to know the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to loose with the victory of Christ, and we have to bind with the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to bind all the things that are contrary to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To pray with authority is for heaven to rule on the earth; it is for the earth to exercise the heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every one of us is a man of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, we have the authority of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are merely sojourning on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone who is called by the name of the Lord is His representative on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are God's messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have His life, and we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why we have the heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everywhere we go, we can exercise our heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can rule over the earth through heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May God be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that we can all be prayer warriors for the Lord and that we will all be overcomers through the authority of Christ so that Christ's victory can be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, there is a sober warning: we must submit ourselves to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not submit to God's authority, we cannot pray with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only must we submit to God's authority with respect to His position, but we also must submit to His authority in our daily living and in all practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unless we do this, we cannot pray with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a young brother who was once casting out a demon from a young girl.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The demon told the girl to undress herself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The brother commanded the demon with authority, saying, "I command you in the name of Jesus not to undress yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The demon immediately said, "All right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not allow me to undress, I will not do it."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the young brother was not victorious in his living, he would have been defeated before the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In that case, not only would the demon have ignored his command, but it would have exposed his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, we know that the whole creation was originally under man's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the creation is disobedient to man today because man will not obey God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The lion slew the man of God because he did not obey God's word 1 Kings 13:20-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Daniel was not hurt by the lions when he was thrown into the lions' den, because he was innocent before God and he had done no harm before the king.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouth Dan 6:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A poisonous snake could not hurt the hand of God's faithful servant Paul Acts 28:3-6 , yet worms could kill the proud Herod 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, if we submit to God's authority, the demons will be afraid of us and submit to our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible shows us the relationship between prayer, fasting, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prayer indicates that we seek after God, while fasting indicates that we deny our self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first right God gave to man was the right to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first thing God gave to Adam was food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To fast is to renounce one's lawful right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians only fast but do not deny themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In such a case, their fasting cannot be considered fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Pharisees fasted on the one hand and extorted on the other hand Matt 23:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they were really fasting, they should have returned what they had extorted from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prayer is to seek for God, while fasting is to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to seek God and deny the self at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When our pursuit of God and our denial of self is joined and mingled together, immediately there is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we have faith, we have the authority to command the demons to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, if we seek after God but do not deny our self, we do not have faith, and we do not have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we seek after God and deny our self, immediately we will have faith and authority and be able to utter prayers of faith and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, the most important prayers and the most spiritual prayers are prayers of authority.</S>
