   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels Exo 25:23-26, 29-32, 36-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Following these verses we must read from Exodus 37: And he made the table of shittim wood...And he made the candlestick of pure gold...And he made the incense altar of shittim wood vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>10, 17, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now let us read Leviticus 24:1-9: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And it shall be Aaron s and his sons ; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BLOOD AND THE INCENSE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must continue to see more about the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that the tabernacle consists of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surrounding the outside of the tabernacle is the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ark, which typifies Christ, is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the ark there is the mercy seat sprinkled with the blood for atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is here that God meets with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When man meets God at the mercy seat, he must take with him two things: the blood and the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man must get the blood from the outer court and burn the incense within the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By these two things, the blood and the incense, he is qualified and permitted to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know that the blood in typology signifies the blood of Jesus, through which we are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the incense signifies the sweet odor of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So the blood is for redemption, and the incense is for acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is by the blood that we are redeemed, and it is in this sweet incense of Christ that we are accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By these two things we can contact God in a bold way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We get the blood from the outer altar, and we burn the incense at the inner altar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is by these, the blood and the incense, that we are accepted by God, and it is also by these that we contact, meet, and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So, as we have seen, the incense altar is the center of the tabernacle.</S>
