   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST OVERCOMER CONFERENCE IN HANGCHOW The Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During our prayer meeting in the middle of May 1934, the brothers meeting in the Lord's name in Hangchow perceived a hunger among God's children for the truth in our age of desolation, and felt that we should pray that God could have a conference through the Hangchow brothers to serve the brothers and sisters in the various places.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Decision</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After much prayer, the Lord's Spirit led us, the brothers and sisters in Hangchow, to be of one mind in acknowledging this to be the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A brother drafted a plan concerning the date of the conference, whom we would invite to speak, and the plans for every aspect of the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have been meeting in Hangchow for less than a year, and we do not have many people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are very few rich brothers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In man's eyes it did not seem that we were worthy to hold such a large conference, nor did we dare do it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not like other institutions which have an economic supply or other sources of income, nor are we like other organizations which have money prepared for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "offerings" that we receive just barely cover the rent, and there are many unemployed brothers among us who need help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under these conditions we did not think that we could do it; even the brothers with experience in the Lord thought that it would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Promise</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, thank God, He is our God and our all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two months before the conference, God gave His promise to the brothers with the words "Jehovah Jireh" and "Abraham believed the God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers grasped these two promises and prayed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So they decided to have this Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our brothers continued to bear the responsibility for prayer for another two months.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Living Quarters</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our living quarters could at most accommodate about two hundred brothers and sisters from other provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To our surprise, about four hundred registered, more than twice the original number.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Shortly before the conference, there was the problem of not having enough accommodations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank the Lord, three days before the conference, He gave us a large building that could hold five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was more than we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those from Other Provinces</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although not all who registered actually came, there were more than four hundred people at the conference, including those from our province and Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was something we never expected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Date of the Conference</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The date of the conference was October 6-17.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Expenses</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The daily expenses for both before and after the meetings and for supplying the brothers were great for this reason many brothers were worried for us , but God never allowed us to lack in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank God most heartily for showing us the reliability of His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second afternoon of the conference, we had only ten cents, but we had a large bill that we needed to pay immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise God, He not only kept us from losing our credibility before man; He also allowed us to see His glory in this matter and comforted the hearts of this weak, useless group of servants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot but thank and praise God, and we also want to thank the brothers and sisters who prayed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During the ten days, the preaching in the morning and afternoon meetings was borne by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meetings were very good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A separate report will be given of the topics and outlines of the messages.</S>
