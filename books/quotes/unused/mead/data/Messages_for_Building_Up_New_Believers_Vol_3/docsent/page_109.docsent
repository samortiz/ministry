   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Ecumenical Affiliations</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having the Body as the Boundary</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Allowing Sectarianism to Remain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already referred to different types of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One type has a boundary greater than that of the Body; it receives even the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another type has a boundary that is smaller than the Body; it is an organization, a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Still another type has a boundary that is as large as the Body of Christ, but within this boundary there are segregated squares.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is like a checkerboard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The boundary is as large as the Body of Christ, yet there are sects in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each minds his own business within his sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is organized unity, not unity itself; it is an affiliation of oneness, not oneness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the boundary of this kind of fellowship is as large as the Body, there are still many sects within this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to statistics in the 1930s, there were at least fifteen hundred of these little squares.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the church should be divided into sects, God would surely have spoken of it clearly in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But God tells us in the Bible that the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is only one Body, and every member is joined to this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the only possible way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even a machine or a car cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it is divided, it cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today many sects are striving to unite themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I feel compelled to point out the ground upon which such ecumenical boundaries are based.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. The Body Not Having an Organization</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>as Its Basic Unit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that the Body is made up of members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the members are the basic units of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today ecumenical workers see the Body of Christ, but they are not willing to pay the price to take the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They emphasize the Body of Christ, yet the Body which they speak of does not have the members as its unit but organizations as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The basic unit of Christian fellowship should be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is Christians who are joined together to form the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the ecumenical affiliations of today take certain organizations as their basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, if there are five thousand denominations throughout the world, they say that there are five thousand basic units in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can only be called a fellowship of organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fellowship in the Bible takes individual Christians as its basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am a believer, and you are a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two of us spontaneously have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another person is a believer, and as a believer, you will have fellowship with him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fellowship is always carried out on an individual basis.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today ecumenical workers lump believers together into organizations and then unite the many organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Something more has been added to the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>F. Organizations Giving Ground to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible puts all of God s children together in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Together they express His Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But today men have united those with the same opinions, beliefs, and views.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have united men who respect the same persons and have formed them into organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a further step, they try to form associations of different organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are, in reality, first dividing to go along with man s will and then uniting to go along with God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way they think that they have satisfied both sides!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fleshly sectarianism is allowed to remain, while Christian oneness is seemingly achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what ecumenical affiliations are all about.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I say again emphatically that the only purpose for doing this is to give ground to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has shown us that division is a work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, you do not have to go to the denominations to find out that sectarianism is a work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can find this within yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you have to go to other places to find this out, I question your spiritual condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Human beings are prone to division.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone likes to separate himself from other brothers and sisters according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today many people like to keep denominations on the one hand and try to arrive at some form of unity on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is self-contradictory!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They think that denominationalism can remain, and they try to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But then they join themselves to ecumenical affiliations because their conscience is bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is to divide the Body first and then to try to unite it later.</S>
