   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people think that the New Jerusalem is a physical city or is "heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But according to Revelation 1:1, all the things revealed in Revelation are signs and symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 5, the church is the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 21:2 and 9 say that the New Jerusalem is the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So the New Jerusalem is not a physical place or the so-called "heaven"; rather, it is the enlargement, completion, fullness, and ultimate expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the mingling of the Triune God and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. A Mutual Habitation</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 21:3 tells us that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that it is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, 21:22 shows us that the holy city is the temple of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that God lives in His people and His people live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Jerusalem is the mutual habitation of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After many generations of dispensing Himself into His people, God and His people coinhere one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Would you like to go to heaven or would you rather be in this coinherence?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Going to heaven to be with God" is too poor compared to such a coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To live in the Triune God and to have the Triune God live in us is the greatest blessing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Possessing God's Life and Nature</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 21:18 says that "the building material of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 11 says that the light of the New Jerusalem "was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jasper is dark green.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It signifies life in its richness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Green grass, green fields, and green mountains all testify of the richness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a field is brown we have the impression that there is no life there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The great wall of the New Jerusalem is a shining testimony of the richness of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 4:3 says that God Himself has the appearance of jasper stone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Keep in mind that the New Jerusalem is just the enlargement of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That means that one day God's people will have the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will fully express the richness of God's life!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within the wall, the city is of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You will recall that gold symbolizes God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we, God's people, will be fully constituted with God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outwardly the city is green, expressing the divine life; inwardly it is gold, full of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is truly a glorious picture!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the ultimate result of the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more He dispenses Himself into us, the more we receive His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we were going to the lake of fire, now we are going into God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Originally, we were full of the satanic nature; at the end, we will be full of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only way to get from here to there is to receive more of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to escape the corruption that is in the world in order to partake of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What a way!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What a conclusion!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>OUR ETERNAL DESTINATION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's eternal desire is to get a group of people who are fully mingled with Him to be His universal expression and mutual dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The entire Bible reveals God in His Trinity working toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We see the Triune God reaching man, then bringing man back into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Old Testament He was triune when He made man and dealt with man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Gospels He actually became a man Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus was the first man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God wanted many more such men, so in Acts we see Him as the Spirit propagating Himself into tens of thousands of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Epistles show us the development of these believers into the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Revelation we see the final product, the ultimate consummation, of the Triune God's dispensing the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the enlargement and fullness of the lampstand, the church, and the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is the ultimate mingling of humanity and divinity, the coinherence of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This fulfills Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible ends the way it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It begins with God's image for His expression, and it ends with a vast, immense, splendid corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is our eternal destination and the Triune God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is according to what the Father has planned, what the Son has accomplished, and what the Spirit is applying.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What a plan!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What an accomplishment!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What an application!</S>
