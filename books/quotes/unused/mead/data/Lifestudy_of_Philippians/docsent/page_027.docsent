   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THINKING THE ONE THING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way the Philippians could make Paul s joy full was to think the same thing, even the one thing 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the context of the entire book, the one thing must refer to the subjective knowledge of Christ and experience of Christ 1:20-21; 2:5; 3:7-9; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ, and Christ alone, should be the centrality and universality of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our thinking should be focused on the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Anything else causes us to think differently and thus creates dissensions among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What troubled Paul in his imprisonment was the dissension among the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The saints in Philippi were good, and the church in that city had been well established.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, there was dissension among them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although they were one in spirit, they were not striving together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although they all loved the Lord, they were not thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This caused Paul s heart to be heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of heaviness of heart, he appealed to the Philippians to make his joy full by being joined in soul and by thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HAVING THE SAME LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thinking the same thing is related to having the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul s word in verse 2 about having the same love indicates that, because of their dissenting thinking, the Philippian believers had different levels of love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They did not have the same love toward all the saints for the keeping of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is possible that we in the church life today may not have the same love for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, our love may be on different levels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may love a certain brother much more than we love another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we may love a particular brother only to a small degree, we may not be inclined to render much service to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But because we love another brother to a very high degree, we may serve him too much and even spoil him by our love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is possible in the church life to have different levels of love for different saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is our situation, our love is not the love with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have one kind of soul when we love one brother, but a different kind of soul when we love another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, instead of practical oneness, there will be dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2:2 Paul also speaks of being joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the dissension among the Philippians was due to their not being joined in soul, not thinking the one thing in their mind, the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their problem was not with their spirit, but with their soul, especially with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They had Christ in their spirit through regeneration, but they did not have Christ fully in their soul through transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only by having Christ saturate and occupy their entire soul could they be made one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Philippians had been joined in spirit, but they had not been fully joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have different levels of love is a sign that we have not been joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have been joined in soul, we shall have the same love for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>RIVALRY AND VAINGLORY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2:3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, Doing nothing by way of rivalry nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind counting one another more excellent than yourselves, not regarding each his own things, but each the things of others also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s word about rivalry and vainglory may indicate that the dissenting Philippians were doing things out of rivalry or vainglory, both of which cause dissension among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rivalry and vainglory may lie hidden among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even when we testify in the church meetings, there may be rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps when you share, not many saints say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when someone else shares, the saints are very responsive, and there are many amens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Disappointed by the situation, you may decide never to share again in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, in giving testimonies there may be rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even when we share our experiences of Christ, a feeling of rivalry may be hidden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some brothers have advised the saints to say amen to the weaker ones in order to encourage them, but not to say amen as much to the strong ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kind of encouragement simply feeds the flesh and strengthens the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I say once again that in the church life it is possible to have rivalry among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose a number of brothers come into the church life close to the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, one among them is appointed to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The others may be displeased and ask why that particular brother was made an elder, when he has not been in the church any longer than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a word may not be uttered, but this thought may be in the heart of those brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rivalry and vainglory are often found together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where there is rivalry, there is usually vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why are you unhappy when the saints do not say amen to your testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why do the brothers not feel pleased when a certain brother is appointed an elder and they are not?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Also because of vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 4:2 Paul says, I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe that there was rivalry between these two sisters, perhaps competition over who would be the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, they were doing things in the way of rivalry and vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there had not been rivalry and vainglory among the Philippian believers, Paul would not have mentioned these things in 2:3.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I ask you not to do anything by way of rivalry or vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will help to make my joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers, I am troubled by the fact that some among you are doing things in the way of rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am happy that you love the Lord and that you are standing there in Philippi for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I rejoice, but my rejoicing is not yet full.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It cannot be full as long as rivalry exists among you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, some of you are seeking vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you have any consolation of love toward me, please make my joy full by not doing anything by way of rivalry or vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead, in lowliness of mind, count others more excellent than yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not easy to get rid of rivalry and vainglory, for we have a natural tendency to compete with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In certain countries children are encouraged strongly to compete.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In society competitiveness is found everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, we should not compete in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead of competing with one another, we should count others more excellent than ourselves.</S>
