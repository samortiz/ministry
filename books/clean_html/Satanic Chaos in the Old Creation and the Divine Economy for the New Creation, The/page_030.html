<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>q. Some, as Hymenaeus and Alexander,<br>Thrusting Away Faith and a Good Conscience<br>and Becoming Shipwrecked regarding the faith</H2><P>Some, as Hymenaeus and Alexander, thrust away faith and a good conscience and became shipwrecked regarding the faith (1 Tim. 1:19-20; cf. 4:1-2). Hymenaeus and Alexander must have been leading ones, prominent ones in the churches, yet they had a very serious change.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>r. All the Believers in Asia<br>Turning Away from Paul's Ministry</H2><P>All the believers in Asia turned away from Paul's ministry. The word all in 2 Timothy 1:15 indicates what the situation was in a general way. It does not mean that everyone in Asia forsook Paul's ministry. Generally speaking, the saints and the churches in Asia forsook Paul's ministry. The New Testament indicates that this was the reason the churches in Asia became degraded.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>s. Some, as Hymenaeus and Philetus,<br>Misaiming concerning the Truth,<br>Saying That the Resurrection Had Already Taken Place</H2><P>Some, as Hymenaeus and Philetus, misaimed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection had already taken place (2 Tim. 2:17-18). To misaim here is to miss the mark, to swerve, to deviate. Saying that the resurrection had already taken place was a serious heresy that denied the divine power in life (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Rev. 20:4, 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>t. Demas Loving the Present Age<br>and Abandoning the Apostle Paul</H2><P>Demas, a co-worker of Paul, loved the present age and abandoned the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 4:10a). Today certain co-workers have left us. Even at Paul's time such a thing happened when Demas abandoned Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>u. Alexander the Coppersmith Doing<br>Many Evil Things to the Apostle Paul</H2><P>Alexander the coppersmith, an opposer and an attacker of the apostle Paul, did many evil things to him (2 Tim. 4:14-15). Alexander once might have been very close to Paul but later hated him and became his enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>v. In Paul's First Defense<br>No One Being with Him to Support Him,<br>but All Abandoning Him</H2><P>In Paul's first defense no one was with him to support him, but all abandoned him, leaving him alone (2 Tim. 4:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>w. Some Going Beyond<br>and Not Abiding in the Teaching of Christ</H2><P>Some went beyond and did not abide in the teaching of Christ (2 John 9-11). This means that certain ones did not abide in the teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work. Such ones were heretics, and John told us to quarantine them and not to invite them into our homes or to greet them.</P>
