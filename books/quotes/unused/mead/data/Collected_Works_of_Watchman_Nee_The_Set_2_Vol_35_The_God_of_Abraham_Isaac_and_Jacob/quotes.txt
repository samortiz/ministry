[2]  Watchman Nee gave a series of studies on the characters of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the early part of 1940.

[4]  ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION
[5]  God said, "I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" Exo 3:6 .
[6]  In order to bring a group of people to come under His name, and in order to make them His people, God did a special work in three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, respectively, and gave each one of them particular experiences.
[7]  First Corinthians 10:11 says, "Now these things happened to them as an example..."
[8]  The Bible records the history of the Israelites as an example to us.
[9]  God chose the Israelites to be His people, and He also chose men from among the Gentiles to be His people Acts 15:14 .
[10]  Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be a people of God.
[11]  Abraham was a father himself, and the lesson he learned was to know God as the Father.
[12]  Throughout his whole life, he learned this one lesson knowing God as the Father.
[13]  We have mentioned previously that God desires to gain a group of men who are called by His name and who are His people.
[14]  He wants to gain a group of people who can say that they belong to God and that they are God's people.
[15]  In order to achieve this goal, He first worked on Abraham, then on Isaac, and finally on Jacob.
[16]  The experiences of Abraham plus Isaac plus Jacob are the basic experiences of all who desire to be God's people.
[17]  We have to pass through certain dealings and certain trainings before we can become God's people and before we can truly live for God on this earth.
[18]  In other words, although many people can be called by God's name and outwardly be known as God's people, they are not qualified to become God's people unless they see that everything they have is from God, that everything is received, and that everything of the natural life has to be laid aside by God.
[19]  Even though Abel offered sacrifices to God by faith, he was only a good person individually; we cannot receive blessing from him; hence, he is not the beginning of the recovery work of God.
[20]  God's purpose in calling Abraham was to recover man from the sinful situation.
[21]  We should not consider the choosing of Abraham to be a personal matter.
[22]  In God's selection of Abraham, three things were included: 1 bringing him into the land which God would show him, 2 making him a great nation that would become God's people, and 3 blessing all the families of the earth through him.
[23]  God called Abraham to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house and go to a land that He would show him.
[24]  In the Old Testament there was a nation, Israel, because God wanted a people on this earth, that is, He wanted a group of people who were separated unto God, who were for His glory, and who belonged to Him.
[25]  God does not bless the nations of the earth directly.
[26]  Now we will consider how Abraham was called to follow God.
[27]  In reading Joshua 24, we find that Abraham was born into a family that served idols.
[28]  This shows us that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .
[29]  The first time was in Ur, while the second time was in Haran.
[30]  God said this to show Abraham that in spite of two thousand years of man's failure and in spite of the multiplicity of man's sin, God was coming in now to recover him.
[31]  CHAPTER THREE ABRAHAM AND THE LAND OF CANAAN Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2; Gen 12:4 13:18; 14:11-23
[32]  "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord" Gen 12:8 .
[33]  The name Bethel in the original language means "the house of God."
[34]  God is not after hundreds and thousands of strong, but uncoordinated, men like Samson, and He is not after a pile of unorganized, living stones.
[35]  One characteristic of Canaan is that God's people are the temple of God and the house of God.
[36]  Hebrews 3:6 tells us that it was not Moses who was over this house, but the Son of God who is over this house.
[37]  "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord" Gen 13:18 .
[38]  After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible shows us that he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan.
[39]  Let us consider these three tests one by one.
[40]  Soon after Abraham reached Bethel, failure set in. This was God's dealing to show him that his calling was of God's mercy and was not due to his own goodness.
[41]  CHAPTER FOUR ABRAHAM AND HIS SON 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 4:3, 17-22; Gal 4:23-26, 28; Gen 15 16:4a, 15-16 GOD'S PROMISE AND ABRAHAM'S FAITH
[42]  The matter of Canaan was settled for Abraham, but from Genesis 15, we see the matter of his son.
[43]  This does not mean that Canaan is no longer an issue after chapter fifteen.
[44]  It was very meaningful for God to reassure Abraham with such a word even though he had just come back from a victory.
[45]  We have to pay attention to the following words: "And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
[46]  And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
[47]  God then told him that only he who came forth out of his own bowels would be his heir, and that his seed would be as the stars in heaven.
[48]  Genesis 15:5 says, "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
[49]  But when God was telling Abraham of the multiplicity of his descendants, He used the word "seed" in the singular.
[50]  The Bible specifically says that "Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan" v. 3 . When Abraham first arrived in Canaan, God promised, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" 12:7 . Just before these events God promised him again, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir." By the time he was eighty-five years old, however, he still had no son.
[51]  It was not a question of whether Abraham should have a son.
[52]  Galatians 4 says that "the one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh...from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.
[53]  Keeping the law means giving something to God and pleasing God.
[54]  Romans 4:19-22 says, "And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah's womb; but with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do.
[55]  After he begot Ishmael, there was a thirteen-year period in which God did not speak to him Gen 16:16 17:1 .
[56]  Whenever we act according to the flesh, God puts us aside and allows us to eat the fruit of our flesh.
[57]  God said, "This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised" v. 10 . In other words, God wants a people, yet they must not have any fleshly activity, power, or strength.
[58]  Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."
[59]  Philippians 3:3 says, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."
[60]  After being dealt with by God for so many years, what kind of person did Abraham become?
[61]  He became a person who had no trust in himself.
[62]  Then God said to him, "As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
[63]  God had promised Abraham earlier that "he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
[64]  After more than ten years, God came again and told him that he would have a son through his wife Sarah.
[65]  In chapter eighteen, after Abraham believed and was circumcised, his fellowship with God became more intimate.
[66]  This shows that he was indeed a friend of God.
[67]  It is interesting that "the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife" v. 18 . After Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, "Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children" v. 17 . After this incident, Sarah begot Isaac in chapter twenty-one.
[68]  After Abraham realized that God is the Father through his intercession for the women in Abimelech's house, Sarah bore him a son at God's appointed time.
[69]  The day Isaac was weaned, God spoke a word through Sarah: "Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac" v. 10 . This was not Sarah's jealousy.
[70]  Genesis 22:1-2 says, "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
[71]  When he heard that God wanted him to offer up Isaac, he did not feel that this was a difficult thing to do.
[72]  Nothing was more precious than God Himself, not even the most important work that He had assigned.
[73]  He is after the descendants of Abraham, the church, who will fulfill His purpose.
[74]  Abraham's history includes both his own experience and the necessary experience of every vessel of God.
[75]  In reading the history of Abraham, we have to realize that it is not only a description of Abraham's experience in being dealt with by the Lord, but it is also a description of the standard by which God deals with all of His people.
[76]  God wants us to be His vessels for the fulfillment of His own plan; He wants us to have a part in His recovery work.
[77]  There was still the need of Isaac and Jacob to be added to Abraham before God could gain what He intended to gain in Abraham.
[78]  Abraham knew God as the Father, and as a result, he also became a father.
[79]  We have to pay attention to two things in Isaac's life.
[80]  The first is Isaac's relationship with Abraham, and the second is Isaac's relationship with God.
[81]  Genesis 24:36 says, "And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath."
[82]  The problem with God's children is that they realize God's demand on Abraham, but they do not see the way to meet this demand.
[83]  After God's children see His goal, they think that they should do something to attain the goal.
[84]  In Abraham we see God's purpose, and in Isaac we see the operation of God's life.
[85]  The God of Isaac speaks of the fact that all the life and power one needs to become such a vessel and reach such a standard come from the Son of God.
[86]  In other words, in Isaac we see God supplying Christ to us, while in Jacob we see the Holy Spirit disciplining us.
[87]  Isaac shows us the riches of the resurrection life of Christ which God has given to His children, while Jacob shows us how God deals with the natural life, the soulish life, and the fleshly energy until one day the root is cut off, and the hollow of the thigh is touched.
[88]  We need a vision before God like Abraham had, we need a life like Isaac had, and we need the discipline of the Holy Spirit like Jacob had.
[89]  Just as He revealed Himself to Jacob and became the God of Jacob, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God.
[90]  GOD'S PROVISIONS IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 3:26-29; 4:6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom 6:5-7, 11; Eph 2:4-6; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a; 1 Cor 1:30 THE INHERITANCE GOD HAS PREPARED IN CHRIST
[91]  We know that a man is saved by grace and not by the law.
[92]  When we are in Christ, our past is terminated and we are ushered into the present, in which God has given us another part to our inheritance in Christ.
[93]  God has given us Christ for only one purpose: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .
[94]  The daily life of a Christian is one of enjoying Christ and receiving Christ.
[95]  On the one hand, we stand in Christ, realizing that all that Christ has accomplished is ours.
[96]  On the other hand, while we live on this earth day by day Christ becomes everything that we need.
[97]  THE DISCIPLINE HE RECEIVED Scripture Reading: Gen 25:19-34; 27 30
[98]  Every careful reader of the Word of God cannot fail to find a great difference between the history of Isaac and the history of Jacob.
[99]  Let us consider the way that God accomplished His work in Jacob how God disciplined him, dealt with his natural life, and weakened him, how God caused Christ to be formed in him through the constitution of the Holy Spirit, and how he bore the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[100]  Let us begin with the first section of Jacob's history.
[101]  Rebekah prayed and asked God what was happening in her womb, and God said to her, "Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger" v. 23 . When Rebekah delivered, she indeed had twins.
[102]  After he received his blessing through deception, he could no longer remain at home.
[103]  He knew that his brother would kill him, and he could only escape.
[104]  And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[105]  Genesis 28:16-17 says, "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.
[106]  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
[107]  "And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first" v. 19 . Then Jacob vowed, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" vv.
[108]  God said, " I will keep thee in all places wither thou goest," and Jacob said, "If God...will keep me in this way that I go."
[109]  If God would be with him, keep him, give him food and raiment, and guide him safely back to his father's house in peace, he would reward God with one tenth of his possessions.
[110]  Genesis 29 tells us that Jacob went to the land of the people of the east and saw the shepherds who came from Haran.
[111]  "And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
[112]  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
[113]  When he arrived at his uncle Laban's house, his uncle said to him, "Surely thou art my bone and my flesh," and Jacob abode with him for a month v. 14 . After being a guest of his uncle for a month, his uncle said in a seemingly polite way, "Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?" v. 15 . From this word we see that Laban's mind was also the mind of a businessman.
[114]  OF JACOB'S NATURAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 31 35
[115]  There are a few meanings of the name Jacob in the original language.
[116]  When Jacob took hold of his brother's heel and coveted the birthright and blessing, he was not after God, but after the goodness from God.
[117]  Genesis 32:1-2 says, "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
[118]  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
[119]  God opened his eyes to see that his company of people on earth was one camp, while God's army was another camp; hence, there were the "two camps."
[120]  After Laban left, God gave him a vision and showed him that there was not only a camp on earth, but another camp of heavenly hosts following him.
[121]  "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
[122]  "Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
[123]  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him" vv.
[124]  In this place Jacob was not doing something; he was not praying or wrestling with God.
[125]  God wrestled with Jacob in order to subdue him, strip him of his strength, and pin him down so that he could not struggle any longer.
[126]  In order for a Christian to take God's way, he must receive everything from Christ.
[127]  However, it is not enough for us to just be Isaacs.
[128]  We need God to touch the hollow of our thigh, to weaken us, and to put us out of joint.
[129]  The day will come when God will touch the hollow of our thigh.
[130]  God has been disciplining us for twenty years, but now we need to have the hollow of our thigh put out of joint so that we can no longer stand tall before the Lord.
[131]  Some may ask, "What is the meaning of Peniel?
[132]  How can Jacob's Peniel be applied to us?"
[133]  Jacob was touched by God in the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, and his leg was crippled.
[134]  After a few months or a few years God may show them that He was dealing with their natural life.
[135]  Our experience tells us that we do not know when God deals with our natural life.
[136]  Let us read verse 29: "And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
[137]  And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
[138]  But the man would not give Jacob His name; He would only tell Jacob after he reached Bethel 35:10-11 .
[139]  After one brother heard the story of Jacob at Peniel, he said, "Last Friday night, God touched the hollow of my thigh, and He dealt with my natural strength."
[140]  If a man still acts confidently, speaks persuasively, moves independently, insists on his proposals, and does not wait on God and look to Him when things happen, he is not crippled, and God has not touched him yet.
[141]  Jacob became crippled after Peniel, but he still did not know what he had experienced.
[142]  When the day broke, he still acted according to his original plan.
[143]  They think that Jacob should have stopped his activities because he had been touched by God.
[144]  Esau returned to Seir, and Jacob set off to Succoth.
[145]  "And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city" v. 18 .
[146]  First, he built a house in Succoth v. 17 . Then he bought a parcel of a field, spread his tent, and erected an altar in Shechem, and called it "El-Elohe-Israel," which means "God, the God of Israel" vv.
[147]  After Jacob trusted in the power of the Lord and removed all the things that did not glorify Him, he set out on his journey.
[148]  Verses 6 and 7 say, "So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
[149]  And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel; because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
[150]  After God spoke this, He went up from him v. 13 . When Jacob met God previously, he erected a stone to be a pillar, poured oil on it, and called the name of the place the house of God.
[151]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MATURITY OF JACOB Scripture Reading: Gen 37; 42 49
[152]  After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, he began to recognize his own weakness and was gradually changed.
[153]  He gradually saw the way he should take; he passed through Shechem to Bethel and finally dwelt in Hebron.
[154]  However, this does not mean that Jacob needed no further dealings from God after Peniel.
[155]  The Bible shows us that after Peniel, he seemed to encounter even more dealings from God than before.
[156]  Before this time Jacob was active from morning until evening.
[157]  Later, Joseph was made lord over Pharaoh's house and governor over all the land of Egypt.
[158]  Jacob, on the other hand, was facing famine in the land of Canaan.
[159]  When Jacob was faced with this calamity, he sent his sons to buy corn in Egypt.
[160]  He came to Egypt, saw Joseph, and settled in the land of Goshen.
[161]  Genesis 47:7 says, "And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
[162]  The following words are very precious: "And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head" v.
[163]  "Upon the bed's head" corresponds to "leaning on the top of his staff," which is quoted in the book of Hebrews 11:21 .
[164]  He did not remember how he competed with his brother, how he gained the birthright, or how he took his brother's blessing, etc. All he remembered was his relationship with God.
[165]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Heb 12:5-7, 9-11; Gal 5:22-23; 4:19; 1 Cor 3:12, 14; Gen 2:12; Phil 4:11-12
[166]  The title "the God of Jacob" implies how the Holy Spirit disciplined Jacob, how He dealt with Jacob's natural life, how He constituted Christ into Jacob, and how He bore the fruit of the Spirit in Jacob.
[167]  If we want to know the God of Jacob, we have to know the constitution by the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.
[168]  If we want to know the God of Jacob, we need to allow the Spirit to perform His work in us, to deal with our natural life, to constitute Christ into our inward being, and to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit in us so that we can become the vessels of God's testimony.
[169]  God deals with our natural life for the purpose of ushering us into the carving work of the Spirit, the processing by the Spirit, and the constituting of the Spirit.
[170]  Galatians 5:22-23 says, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control."
[171]  This shows us that "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control" are not virtues given to us by the Holy Spirit, but are fruit borne by the Holy Spirit in us.
[172]  The fruit of the Holy Spirit means that something of Christ is assimilated by us through the work of the Holy Spirit with the result that these things become our character and our characteristics.
[173]  The Holy Spirit is doing one work in us, which is to deal with our natural life and to constitute Christ in us, making Christ's character our character so that spontaneously "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control" will be lived out of us and we will bear the fruit of the Spirit.
[174]  God deals with our natural life so that Christ may be formed in us, that is, that Christ may be wrought into us and constituted in us.
