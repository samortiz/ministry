   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING OURSELVES FROM BEING INVOLVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ANY PROBLEM IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the eighteen years that I was with the co-workers under Brother Nee s leadership, I never caused any problem nor did I get involved with any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the Lord s mercy, I was a pure person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee had two great crises during that time one was due to his marriage and the other one was due to his pharmaceutical business.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was the main one to get the situation solved in both of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last time forced Brother Nee to be away from his ministry for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the Lord s mercy, I went to Shanghai and that brought in a situation which enabled Brother Nee to return to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A revival was brought in mainly through messages I gave on the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nearly all those who did not feel happy with Brother Nee repented.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one proposed or advised this, but they all repented to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My point is this with the elders, the co-workers, and all the brothers, the basic need is to keep yourself from being involved in any problem in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all must learn to be wise not to create any trouble or to speak a light word concerning anyone in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We just say something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING RESTRICTED IN ONE PUBLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One thing that has caused the Lord s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we mean business for the Lord s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He asked me to help in the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember s Earth s Earliest Ages, and some books on the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I never published anything by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I always mailed my manuscript to the Gospel Room, which was under Brother Nee and his helper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was up to their discernment whether my manuscript should be published or not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I liked to have my writings checked as to whether there might be some inaccuracy in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not a small matter to write a book that expounds the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I liked my material to pass through their checking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This helped and protected me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Yu, the eye specialist, translated some of the mystical books, but he did not publish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We only had one publication.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything was published through Brother Nee s Gospel Room because the publication is really the trumpeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sounding of our trumpet is not just in the verbal message but more in the publication.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hate to see that some of the brothers would try to publish something by copying my points mixed with their spices and their color.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why do they need to put out some points from my writings in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee taught us concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I received the basic knowledge from his teaching, but he never expounded on it very much; he simply gave a sketch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was I who from 1936 began to expound upon the sketch given to me by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I published my exposition, Brother Nee admired it and told me personally that it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that some of you brothers would do much development and expounding of all the messages I give.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not merely speak some points, adding your own color and spices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This changes the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It damages my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must receive the ability to expound all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would like to see that all of you will be great servants used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How wonderful that would be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I do not like to see that some would merely repeat what I have said, pretending that it is their work with their spices and color.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It bothers me that some brothers among us still put out publications.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to my truthful observation there is no new light or life supply there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Based upon this fact, what is the need for these brothers to put out their publications?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because all the publications are mine, it is hard for me to speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I am forced to tell the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By putting out your own publication, you waste your time and money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You waste the money given by the saints, and you waste their time in reading what you publish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where is the food, the life supply, and the real enlightenment in the other publications among us?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Be assured that there is definitely at least one major revelation in every Living Stream Ministry publication.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was burdened to publish the Life-study Messages to stress the matter of life because this matter has been neglected, missed, and even lost to the uttermost in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In most of the commentaries and expositions there is not much of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the term Life-study is a new term.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have used this term for thirty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1954 and 1955 I finished a Life-study on the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that I am so capable or so knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It all depends upon whether or not our sovereign Lord has given you this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though I wrote some books in mainland China, I never dared to publish anything by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not like to have another sounding.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our sounding must be one, so we must be restricted in one publication.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>My intention in calling a writers conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This fellowship may preserve and protect us from doing things lawlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If some localities would have gone the proper way of the recovery, using all the materials of the ministry, their number would have increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some are wasting their time by writing and publishing their own material.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I would like to see that many brothers had this portion with the riches of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This would be marvelous and wonderful, but this is our problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I advise all of you to take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You have to swallow up the dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not let dissension eat you up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope this fellowship will render some help to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Take these principles, pray before the Lord, and consider the real situation in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then you can make some adjustment of the eldership.</S>
