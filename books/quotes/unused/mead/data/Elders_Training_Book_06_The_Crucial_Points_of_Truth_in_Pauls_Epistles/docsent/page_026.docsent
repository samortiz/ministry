   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PHILIPPIANS AND COLOSSIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we shall consider the crucial points in the books of Philippians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PHILIPPIANS The Bountiful Supply</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>for Living and Magnifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first crucial point in this book is found in 1:19-21.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit here is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord s resurrection, compounded with the Lord s incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to verses 20 and 21, this bountiful supply is for the believers to live Christ and to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The living and magnifying of Christ is our daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be saved daily by experiencing Christ to live Him and to magnify Him by the all-inclusive, bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Letting the Mind of Christ Be in Us</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter two of Philippians contains several crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first is found in verse 5 which says, Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse is similar to Colossians 3:16 which says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Something that can dwell in you must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word there is personified; it is the word as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must let this Person dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the mind which was in Christ Jesus to be in us means that this mind is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To translate this phrase as take the mind of Christ, or possess the mind of Christ would be to lose the proper significance of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The mind of Christ actually is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, Paul did not say, Let Christ be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, he said to let this mind, this particular mind which was in Christ Jesus, be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not forget that the subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book firstly tells us in chapter one that we need the all-inclusive bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, this bountiful supply is for us to live Christ and to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The means for us to live Christ is the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, chapter two gives us another point concerning our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second means for us to experience Christ is to let the living mind which was in Christ Jesus be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is in the universe a living Mind, a mind which Paul calls this mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This living Mind is waiting for you to open up yourself and let Him in. It is not simply that you take Christ as a pattern to imitate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The point here is that the Christ whom we experience is very practical and available.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His mind especially is so living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as our minds are so active, the mind of Christ is even more active.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Paul s writings he sometimes refers to Christ s meekness and Christ s forbearance 2 Cor 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, meekness and forbearance are not personified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But here His mind is likened to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot say that the meekness or the forbearance of Christ dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul does not use this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather he says to let this mind which is in Christ Jesus be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means practically speaking the Person of Christ is manifested in His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must take the practical Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is living, and His mind is living and waiting for us to open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must open ourselves to let such a mind be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we let the living mind of Christ be in us, this mind will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 4:23 says that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and Romans 12:2 says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The renewed mind, the mind with the spirit, is the mind indwelt by the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This mind which was in Christ is a transforming mind, a renewing mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To have the mind of Christ in us is for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not merely follow Christ s steps outwardly, but we let Christ s living mind be in us inwardly to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this we will live a life that is a mingled life, a life of divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This portion of Philippians 2 shows us a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is revealed here to be both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The life lived by this God-man is a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not an exchanged life but two lives in one union.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was God yet He did not live in the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather He took the form of a slave and was found in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a one was God living in humanity with the form of a slave in the fashion of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ did not simply spend one year in the fashion of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For thirty-three and a half years He was found in the fashion of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His living was His work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Philippians 3:9 Paul desired to be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In chapter two Christ was found in the fashion of a man, and in chapter three Paul desired to be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This refers to his living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we have the living mind of Christ, this mind will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our transformed form will simply be His image.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whatever Christ lived will be lived out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ was humble, and spontaneously we will be the same, because He will be the mind acting and living in us to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Spontaneously we will live a life which is a grafted life, two lives mingled together as He had.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When He was being found in the fashion of a man, He lived a life which was the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The life of God and the life of man became the mingled life of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we repeat His history by living a mingled life of two natures, both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His life was both divine and human, and our life is human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In principle, our life is the same as His.</S>
