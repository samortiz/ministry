   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE BUILDING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; John 14:23; Eph 3:17; 4:15-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 4:2-3; 21:18a, 19a, 11 OUTLINE The Triune God's transformation in the believers is His building in the believers not merely His making the believers the precious materials for the building of the church: Through the transformation of the believers, the Triune God builds Himself into the believers and with their transformed new man constitutes the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Triune God is the life and reality of the Body, and the believers are the frame and expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 14:23 speaks of God the Father and God the Son coming to those who love Him and making an abode in them, and Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in the hearts of the believers, who have been strengthened through the Spirit both refer to this divine and mysterious building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's building in the believers is the growth and increase of God's life in the believers Eph 4:15-16; Col 2:19: This building of the transformation in life is for the church the Body of Christ 1 Cor 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This cannot be accomplished by the teaching that is based on the principle of forsaking evil and following good; only the revelation that is according to the principle of the divine life can produce the building of the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To build all the mature saints to be a corporate duplication of God as the New Jerusalem: The appearance of God on the throne is like jasper Rev 4:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The wall of the New Jerusalem and its first foundation are also jasper to express what God is Rev 21:18a, 19a, 11.</S>
