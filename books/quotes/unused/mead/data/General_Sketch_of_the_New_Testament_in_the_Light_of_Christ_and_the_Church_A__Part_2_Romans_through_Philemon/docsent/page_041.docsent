   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN SPIRIT AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 5 tells us that since Christ has set us free from the law and has made us one with Him, we should not go back to the law v. 1 . If we return to the law, then Christ will profit us nothing, and we will be brought to nought, separated from Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we must now live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we live and walk by the Spirit, the flesh and the self are put away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the self and the flesh have been dealt with already on the cross of Christ, this has to be applied and experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we live and walk by the Spirit, our self and flesh are put away in our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter the phrase by the Spirit is a problem to the readers because there is no definite article in the Greek vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>5, 16, 18, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult for translators to decide whether these portions refer to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatians 5:16 says, "Walk by the Spirit," but the Greek text may be simply rendered, "Walk by spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 17 says, "The flesh lusts against the Spirit," and verse 22 speaks of "the fruit of the Spirit," both using the definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although these verses contain the same grammatical construction, some versions render spirit in the former and Spirit in the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, verse 25 does not have the definite article, yet many versions render the word as Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With or without the definite article, the same word may be rendered as spirit or Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, the term Holy Spirit is not used in this chapter; in each case it is only a form of the word pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This simply shows us that the Spirit of God is one with our human spirit, and to live in our spirit is to live in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are one spirit with the Lord; the Spirit and our spirit mingle as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To walk in the Spirit or to walk in spirit means the same thing; it means that we live and walk in our human spirit mingled with the Spirit, or we may say, in the Spirit who mingles Himself with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we can realize that the Christian walk is a matter of living and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we must learn how to exercise our spirit; this is the key and the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, God's intention is that Christ be everything to us, and Christ is in us, that is, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we must do now is live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we must know how to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will have the practical experience of Christ in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE WORLD CRUCIFIED TO US AND WE TO THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter six is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It reveals mainly that the world has been crucified to us and we to the world v. 14 . We have been crucified, and we are on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the cross of Christ is our ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, because of the cross the whole world, including the law and Judaism, has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The world in verse 14 includes everything on the earth involving the human race, but in the thought of the writer, the world especially includes Judaism with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know this because 1:4 contains the same thought, saying, "Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek word here is not kosmos, meaning world, but aionos, meaning age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The world as a whole is composed of many ages, and each age is the part of the world which we contact at the present.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The present evil age at the apostle's time was mainly Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, to be delivered from the present age at the apostle's time means to be delivered from Judaism, although in principle the age includes everything of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As far as we are concerned, because of the cross the whole world, including Judaism and the law, is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, as far as the world is concerned, we are crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we and the world have nothing to do with one another because between us two there is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our position is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in our life, living, and daily walk, we know nothing of circumcision or uncircumcision; we only know one thing to be a new creation 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Circumcision and uncircumcision are matters belonging to the old creation, but now we are a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul knew nothing of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not want to bear the signs of the law upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, he bore in his body the brands of Jesus v. 17 . THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The last verse in chapter six says, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen" v. 18 . The closing word, the conclusion, of Galatians is that we must know two things grace and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How regrettable today that Christians know nearly nothing about grace and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In today's Christianity it is difficult to hear any messages on these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace in our spirit is nothing less than God in Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any other definition of grace is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The grace in verse 18 is a grace that is in us, even in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What else can be in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may say that grace is something of the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit strengthens, tempers, enlightens, guides, leads, and teaches us in our spirit, but this is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually we have to say that this guiding, leading, enlightening, strengthening, helping, and speaking Spirit is the grace Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Grace in our spirit is nothing less than the Triune God God Himself in Christ as the Spirit enjoyed by us daily, hourly, and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the gracious God in His Son by the Spirit to be enjoyed by us as our comfort, our strength, our peace, our might, and as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no better definition for grace than this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must know this grace, and we must know how to exercise our spirit because this wonderful grace is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we must learn how to discern our soul from our spirit Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not know how to discern our spirit, we are like the children of Israel who wandered in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The book of Hebrews speaks of the temple with its three parts the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul to the Holy Place, and our spirit to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Similarly, Egypt, the wilderness, and the good land of Canaan correspond to our body, soul, and spirit respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To enjoy Christ as the Passover in Egypt was similar to enjoying the sin offerings on the altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who left Egypt and came into the wilderness typify people in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who wandered in the wilderness enjoyed the manna and the living water from the cleft rock; that is, they enjoyed a certain amount of God's presence, as the priests did in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This corresponds to the Christians today who are in the soul, the soulish Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hebrews encourages us to press on to enter the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can enter into the Holy of Holies in a practical way by discerning our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we enter into our spirit, we enjoy the good land.</S>
