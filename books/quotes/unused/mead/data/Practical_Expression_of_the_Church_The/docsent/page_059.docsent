   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF HELP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we help these two brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose the black one continually loses his temper and is so rough with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most people will try to convince him that he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They will condemn him, and if he is slightly convinced, they will rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes they will rebuke him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finally, they will ask him to correct and change his attitude "Brother, you know that in the church we must have a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should not behave yourself in such a poor way!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must conduct yourself in love and learn to love others!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what most people do, but it is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose such a brother comes to you, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to my experience, the best way is not to condemn and adjust him, but to minister life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pray-read a part of the Word with him and bring him into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a certain amount of pray-reading and contacting the Lord, you may say something to him in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Brother, we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Good does not mean anything to the Lord even our best does not mean anything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What the Lord wants is just Himself as our life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By saying this, you are not political and you are not vindicating or condemning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are out of the world of good and evil, and in another world, another sphere, another realm, which can help him to realize Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is so concerned about being right or wrong, but you must stay in the other realm to help him to realize that neither good nor evil mean anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to bring him out of the sphere of good and evil and into the sphere of Christ, which is the sphere of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, it will take time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You will have to contact him again and again, but always in the principle of bringing him out of the sphere of good and evil and into Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gradually and daily in this way, you will feed this brother with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must feed him little by little and never condemn or rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply feed him with Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever he comes to you, you should never speak of who is right or who is wrong, who is proud or who is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must give him the impression that you do not care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To act nicely or poorly means nothing, but Christ as life means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gradually you will bring him into the full realization of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then he will realize that it is unnecessary to fight against his bad temper and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will forget about this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will turn to the spirit to contact and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TRANSFORMED, NOT CHANGED</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually this black brother will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He may be transformed into a transparent black stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may still be black, but transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you never seen a precious stone which is black, but transparent?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a beautiful stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do like to see the black brothers transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are black, but transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have also seen some white brothers transformed to be so crystally transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that those of a quick disposition are better than those of a slow disposition, or visa versa.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some precious stones are white and some are black.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The color of some you cannot tell you do not know whether to call them white, black, blue, or some other color; yet they are beautiful, precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of the brothers are just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not so quick, and they are not so slow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are just something of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to be changed, but we all need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not try to change others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are God's creation; why do you want to change them?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not like to have a church with everyone uniform so nice, and in a sense so humble, yet so dull.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need a variety of colors in different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the beauty of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some brothers and sisters are so simple and easy to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others, however, are so complicated and difficult to manage many times I simply do not have patience with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I have learned to see the beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all must realize that the church is not something to correct, to rebuke or to change.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No, the church is the very means to minister Christ to all kinds of people that they may be transformed with Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let me use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose a sister simply cannot go along with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The other sisters realize that she is a problem in the church life because she has a problem with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the proper way to help her?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The regular way in Christianity is to show love to her and convince her that she is wrong by the teaching in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, you should love her, and then you should try in a nice way to convince her from Ephesians 5 that she is wrong in her relationship with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the usual way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not bad, but as far as Christ as life is concerned, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you have such a sister among you, you must learn the real lesson of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not submission that pleases God, but it is Christ as life expressed in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what God is seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you have learned this lesson, you cannot expect to be through quickly with this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You must care for her day by day, little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You must continually give her something of life till she is brought to the full realization that what she needs is not a kind of submission, but Christ as life expressed in her submission to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then she will know that it is not a problem of being submissive, but of experiencing Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The sisters should not try to change or correct this sister, but minister Christ as life to her.</S>
