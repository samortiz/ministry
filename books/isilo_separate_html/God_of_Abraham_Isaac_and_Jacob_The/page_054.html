The first part of the verse speaks of us being in Christ Jesus. The second part of the verse says, "Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." God has made Christ our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. Righteousness was originally a thing, but the righteousness that God gives us is not a thing but a person. It is the Lord Jesus within us becoming our righteousness. He is our righteousness. Sanctification was originally a condition, but the sanctification that God gives us is not a condition but a person. It is the Lord Jesus within us becoming our sanctification; He is our sanctification. Redemption was originally a hope, but the redemption that God gives us is not a hope but a person. It is Christ within us becoming our hope of glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Christ Himself</H2><P>The daily life of a Christian is one of enjoying Christ and receiving Christ. On the one hand, we stand in Christ, realizing that all that Christ has accomplished is ours. On the other hand, while we live on this earth day by day Christ becomes everything that we need. Christ is the very things themselves. Our sanctification is just Christ, our righteousness is just Christ, our patience is just Christ, and our humility, meekness, and goodness are just Christ. Joy is not when we are happy. Joy is Christ living within us and being expressed as joy. Meekness is not a feigned appearance of weakness before others. It is Christ living within us and being expressed as meekness. Our joy, our meekness, etc., are all Christ Himself. These are the expressions of Christ.</P><P>This is what makes Christianity so special. We have a life within us, and this life is just Christ Himself. There is no need for us to use our own strength. This life will spontaneously express itself in meekness, goodness, humility, and patience. Christ in us becomes our meekness, our goodness, our humility, and our patience. We may think that meekness, goodness, humility, and patience are virtues that we possess, but God's Word shows us that these things are just Christ Himself. God has put His Son within us so that Christ Himself will live spontaneously out of us in all circumstances. When we are tempted by anxiety, this life will manifest itself as patience. When we are tempted by pride, this life will manifest itself as humility. When we are tempted by stubbornness, this life will manifest itself as meekness. When we are tempted by defilement, this life will manifest itself as holiness. Christ will express His patience, His humility, His meekness, and His holiness from within us. Christ becomes our patience, our humility, and our holiness. It is not a matter of our doing, but a matter of Christ living. We do not need to try to be humble by the power of the Lord; rather, Christ is our humility. We do not need to try to be holy by the power of the Lord; rather, Christ is our holiness. We do not need to fulfill God's goal by living by ourselves or even by the power of the Lord. The spontaneous manifestation of Christ Himself fulfills God's goal. When the Lord is expressed through us, we become what we are spontaneously. This is Christianity.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
