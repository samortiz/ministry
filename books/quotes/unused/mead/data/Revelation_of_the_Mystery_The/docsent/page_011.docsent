   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STONE WITH SEVEN EYES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us first read Zechariah chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 9, which is a wonderful Bible verse, says, "For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua upon one stone are seven eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have you ever seen a stone with seven eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose there is a piece of stone here that grows eyes that can see you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a piece of stone must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the stone with eyes in this verse is a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very interesting that the Bible does not put the word living in the record, yet we are able to discover it in our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How do we know that this stone is living?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know because it has eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It not only has eyes, it has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible the number seven means completion intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This stone is not only living, but its livingness is sevenfold intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a stone, and upon it are seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who is this stone?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The verse continues, saying, "I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This stone in God's dealing hand is a stone that removes iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The iniquities of God's people were removed in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is this stone?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This stone is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another verse that proves that this stone is the Lamb of God is Revelation 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse says, "And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lamb has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the stone with seven eyes in Zechariah 3 is the Lamb with seven eyes in Revelation 5.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lamb is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, this stone is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is living, Christ redeemed us from our sins, and Christ has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since Christ is something living and something for redemption, why is He a stone?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This stone is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 21:42 says, "Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The stone that the builders rejected is for the building as indicated by the builders' original intention to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts 4:12 says, "And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to verse 11, this means that there is salvation in no one except the stone rejected by the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those in Christianity often quote Acts 4:12 but ignore 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because most Christian preachers preach salvation but not building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They preach about the Redeemer but not about the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, recently I released several messages telling people that our Savior is the Stone-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Savior is a stone, and this stone is a living stone and a redeeming stone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He saves us not to bring us to heaven but to transform us, who are sinners made of clay, into stones with His stony nature and element.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is not bringing us to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is building us into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 2:20-22 says, "Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus has become the cornerstone for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Peter 2:4-5 says, "Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This passage clearly says that the Lord is the stone.</S>
