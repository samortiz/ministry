   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Grace That Was Given</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Corinthian Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 1:4 speaks of the grace that was given to the Corinthian believers based upon which the apostle thanked God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul thanked God for the grace given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the general habit of most Bible readers to take what they read in the Bible for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may have read 1 Corinthians 1:4 in this way, but we need to see that Paul s mentioning of grace here is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since this word is in verse 4 of the first chapter of 1 Corinthians, grace must be the central subject of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Brethren pointed out that 1 Corinthians solves eleven problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They thought that 1 Corinthians was a problem-solving book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But Paul said in 1:4, I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 9 he said that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that God has called us to participate in, or to partake of, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fellowship, the enjoyment, the participation in, and the partaking of Christ are grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 7 Paul told the Corinthians that they did not lack in any gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To have all the gifts is the issue of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Grace That God Gave to Paul</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Which Made Him a Wise Master Builder</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul received grace not only to make him an apostle but also to make him a wise master builder 1 Cor 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul received all the points concerning the building from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was of God s grace, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was God Himself who made Paul the apostle and the wise master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament, God showed Moses the design of the tabernacle and David the design of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament, for the building up of the church, God gave the plan to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can say this because among all the writers of the New Testament, the Body of Christ is mentioned only by Paul Eph 1:23; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul saw something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He saw that the building of God in the whole universe for the accomplishment of His eternal economy is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This revelation is so high!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Body is constructed with God s elect as the framework and with God as the contents the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real building work of this Body of Christ is the Body s growth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Body of Christ is not built in an organizational way but in the way of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a child is born, he is very small, but after many years he may become very big and tall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His growth is what built him up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only Paul touched this matter because he was the master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He knew the design of God s building, so we have to come to him to receive this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The design he saw is fully shown part by part throughout his fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to pick up all these parts and put them together, just like putting the parts of a jigsaw puzzle together, to give us the proper picture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>17.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Grace That Made Paul an Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who Labored More Abundantly</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Than All the Other Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows the grace that made Paul an apostle who labored more abundantly than all the other apostles; such a grace was God Himself working through the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not I but the grace of God equals no longer I...but...Christ in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that Christ Himself is the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all have to declare that in our labor it is not us, but the grace of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Grace Which Is the Lord Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Himself and Which Is Always with All the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The closing word of 1 Corinthians is: The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that grace has brought all of us in and grace has built all of us together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The brothers who are trainers and co-workers in our full-time training in Anaheim were brought together by the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord s recovery has spread to all the continents.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the churches from these continents invite brothers to go out from Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems that every place looks to Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only thing we in Anaheim can look to is the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are nothing, but He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grace is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No one can bear such a burden as we are bearing here in Anaheim for the full-time training, for the churches in our area, and for the Lord s work everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need Christ as the all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This grace is going out, working, and building up God s desire, that is, the Body of Christ to be consummated in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When God created the old creation with Adam, He said, Very good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when our God sees the New Jerusalem, He may jump up and say, Hallelujah, very, very good!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It s excellent!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This city is the produce of God, who has been processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The only One who can work this out is God Himself as grace to be everything to us.</S>
