<h2 class="head1">IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN BUT POSSIBLE WITH GOD</h2><p>Luke 18 shows the impossibility with men, while Luke 19 shows us the possibility with God. Man cannot make it; he cannot make it by himself. But with God nothing is impossible. Once God operates in man, man is saved. If we have a living faith in God, we will do what man cannot otherwise do. The whole world loves money. Even a child knows how to love money. When a Chinese person learns English, the first word he learns is money. At the end of a man's life, when he writes his will, all that he is concerned about is his money. All men love mammon. God is the opposite of mammon. Either we serve God, or we serve mammon (Matt. 6:24). Money is so powerful that it stands in opposition to God! In these two chapters the Lord shows us that He can save us from all sins because He can save us from the thing that we love the most. The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</p><p>When the young man heard the Lord's word, he went away in sorrow because he felt that he could not do it. It is true that he could not make it, but this was precisely his problem. He thought that if he could not make it everything was finished. The minute he saw his own weakness he went away. It is right for man to know that he cannot make it. But it is a great mistake for him to think that God cannot make it. It is right to know that with men, many things are impossible. But thinking that everything is over is a great mistake. In chapter nineteen, we see God performing what man cannot do by himself. What was impossible with men was possible with God. The way to victory is realizing that we cannot make it and that God can make it. God can overcome for us through Christ. If our eyes are set on ourselves, we can never overcome. Even if we acknowledge that we are bound to failure, we will still not overcome. The way to victory is not merely realizing that we cannot make it, but realizing that God has given us Christ, who has overcome everything on our behalf. We cannot make it, but that is not the end. It is true that we cannot make it, but through Christ who lives in us, we can do all things.</p><p>Here I would like to mention one person. I would venture to say that if this person can overcome, everyone in the world can overcome. Last year a Western missionary working in a mission came to me and told me of a man who was sent by the mission board to work in a school. He had been in Shanghai for five or six years but was unable to get along with any of his colleagues or the students of the school because of his terrible temper. The school could do nothing about him, and the mission board could do nothing about him either. They intended to send him back to America in August. The missionary asked if I had time to speak with this man a little. I asked, "Why don't you bring him here?" He answered, "It would not be easy to bring him here. I think he is demon-possessed, or he could not behave the way he does."</p><p>I felt that this was a very strong word. Nevertheless, I realized that my friend could not be lying to me. I became curious and asked what kind of man he was. He said, "This man is very peculiar. He never smiles, and every time he sees someone, his face turns ugly. He is angry all the time, and if you are wrong in anything, he immediately picks on you. Everyone is afraid of him, and everyone stays away from him. He has been this way for six years, and no one in the school is able to get along with him. He changes his servants at home once every few days. He cannot get along with those he lives with, and he argues with all the rickshaw drivers in the streets. Wherever he goes he is always arguing with others. It seems as if he cannot go through a day without arguing with someone. I have been in this world for over fifty years, but I have never seen a person with a temper like his. I have been to England, America, and China, but I have never seen another person like him. I am afraid that he is really demon-possessed. We are very disappointed with him and intend to send him back to America in August. Mr. Nee, since you are familiar with the overcoming truth, can you do something for him? I want you to visit him before he returns home to see if he is indeed possessed. If he is, we may find a way to exorcise the demon."</p><p>When I heard this, I was happy within, because this was another impossible case. Once man can do nothing, God can do something. God takes up only terminal cases. I promised him that I would go and visit the man. He told me that it was impossible for me to go to his home, because he would not come out to see me. He suggested that we go to a third person's home and invite this terrible person along and meet him there. I agreed.</p><p>Two days later I went to the third person's home as arranged. The man came, and after we were introduced to each other, everyone else left the room. As I looked into his face, I almost fainted. I must say that I have never in my life met another man like him. His eyes, nose, mouth, and every feature of his face seemed to be specially designed for his temper. His whole face spoke of anger itself. I realized that what I was told the day before was absolutely accurate. This man may not have smiled once in his whole lifetime. I could not figure out how I could put a smile on that kind of face. His face was made for anger, and its present distinctive features were the cumulative effect of years of temper. I have never met such a person in my entire life. When I saw him, I felt a chill go through my whole body. I was afraid that he was indeed possessed! But the minute he saw me, he broke into tears. Tears rolled down his face, and he began to say, "Nobody wants me any longer." Even his crying appeared to be an expression of anger, and his face looked even uglier. I was frozen with fear before him. I told myself that I would rather sit in a tomb for three years than sit before him for three minutes. When he was really angry, I am sure that he would look even more horrible!</p><p>I asked him, "How do you feel about yourself?" He said, "I always do the shopping for others. I often preach the gospel and pray for others. When others are sick, I pray for them and they get well. But I admit that I have a little temper." I asked, "Only a little?" He said, "To tell you the truth, I have a most terrible temper!" I then asked, "Did you have this when you were a boy, or did you develop it later?" I asked this to find out whether his temper was a natural characteristic or whether he was indeed possessed. He said, "If I remember right, I began to fight with my father when I was seven. When my temper flared up, I would throw things around the house. I can do nothing about it, even today. Not only am I bringing shame to the Lord, but I am sinning all the time by losing my temper. I feel that I am the most wretched man in the whole world because no one greets me or speaks with me. The whole world rejects me and considers me the most wicked man there is." While he was speaking, he was crying, but I began to laugh. He said, "Do not laugh at my temper." I said, "I am not laughing at your temper. I am laughing for joy. I am laughing because you cannot make it. God can make it." He said, "I am afraid that you have never seen me losing my temper. This is why you think that there is still hope." As he was speaking, it seemed as if he would lose his temper in front of me. His face looked very frightening.</p><p>I said, "I see no problem with your condition. It is not hard for you to overcome." He said, "What do you mean? I have been praying and fasting for a long time. But up until now, I still cannot do anything about it. Do you think there is still any hope for me?" I said, "All it takes is an instant. It is not a matter of whether you can make it. It is a matter of whether or not God can do it. Would you say that God cannot save you because you are too evil? You cannot make it on your own, but God can make it. Victory is not in yourself. It is Christ in you overcoming for you. If it were up to us, those who are gentle would find it easy to overcome, while those who are ill-tempered would find it impossible to overcome. Victory has nothing to do with our temper. Victory does not depend on us but on Christ alone. Only Christ in us can overcome for us. Victory is found in Christ, not in us." He said, "Can I overcome?" I said, "You cannot overcome. There is no way for you to overcome. Do you acknowledge this? You cannot make it, yet Christ can make it. The question is not whether you can make it. The question is whether or not you see that you cannot do anything and that Christ can do everything."</p><p>He asked, "What should I do then to stop my temper?" I said, "Do nothing. You have been doing many things for many years, but you are still the same. Now move over and let Christ come in. Let Christ replace you within. Your eyes should not be set on yourself; they should be set on the Christ of God. He will overcome for you." After I said this, we knelt down and prayed together. I told him to open his mouth to pray and to confess to God in an honest way his own failures. He prayed, "I am truly deprived. I have lost hope in myself. I can do nothing. From now on, I will not trust in myself anymore. I cannot overcome. God, if You do not overcome for me, I will not be able to overcome. From now on, I will not take control. You must take all the responsibility!"</p><p>He prayed very sincerely. When he stood up, it was lunchtime. He asked me, "What should I do when I go home?" I said, "Do nothing." He said, "That is right. I have forgotten. Do nothing." He then smiled. That might have been the first time that he smiled. It was an unnatural smile. After he took a few steps, he turned around and said again, "I really should do nothing?" I said, "Yes. Everything will be fine if you do nothing. When Satan tempts you and tries to tell you to be patient, you should say, `I cannot be patient. Christ, be my patience for me!'" He said, "Indeed, indeed." As he was going out he kept saying to himself, "Do nothing. If I am ever going to overcome my temper, it will be God's work, not my work."</p><p>I was worried whether he had the living faith and had truly abandoned his own effort. After a few days I called him on the telephone. The person on the other line answered, saying, "It is so strange! The whole school has never been so quiet as in these last few days. For six years we have never enjoyed such quiet and tranquility. There has been no commotion at all. God has done a miracle and manifested His power in this man." Brothers and sisters, if this man could overcome, anyone can overcome. After a few days, this man came to our meetings, smiling as he walked in. Both his colleagues and the students testified that he had truly changed. He was originally scheduled to be sent back to his own country, but they now have decided to keep him.</p>
