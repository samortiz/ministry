   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX JOINING THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:19, 22; 1 Cor 12:13, 27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The immediate question every believer asks after his conversion concerns joining a church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered the matter of separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean, however, that a person only needs to separate himself from the world and then can stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the positive side, he needs also to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase joining the church is not a proper one; however, we will borrow it for our use for the time being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE NEED TO JOIN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Twenty or more years ago, when our testimony first began, six to eight out of ten persons who were saved had no thought of joining a church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was very strange!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They thought that it was good enough to be a Christian by themselves and that there was no need to join a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may think this is a very strange thought, but according to our experience, quite a number of people think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They want Christ, but they do not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They want to have something to do with Christ, but they do not want to have anything to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They want to be solitary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can we pray by ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they say that this is enough!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can we read the Bible by ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, they think that this is enough!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They think that as long as one can pray and read the Bible by himself, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They think that it is troublesome to join with others and that it is good enough as long as one believes in the Lord and fellowships with Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This concept exists in China, and it exists in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we must realize that whether we like it or not, we have no choice but to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person is saved, he should see that there is an individual aspect as well as a corporate aspect to his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the individual side, he has received the Lord's life, and he can fellowship with the Lord and pray by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He can lock himself up in a room and believe in the Lord by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if he only knows the individual aspect, his testimony will not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, he will not last long and will grow very little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have never seen a reclusive Christian progress well, none in the past and none at present.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the two thousand years of church history, many people have thought that they could be believers individually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have thought they that could live like hermits, shutting themselves up on a mountain and caring for nothing except their fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the spiritual lessons that these ones experienced were very shallow; they could not withstand temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the environment was right, they thrived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the environment became adverse, they could not persevere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must realize that there is another side to the Christian life the corporate side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible, as far as the corporate aspect is concerned, no one can be a solitary Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First of all, God's Word tells us that when a person is saved, he becomes a member of God's household; he becomes God's child.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once a person is born again, he is born into God's family, and he becomes God's child together with many other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, the Bible shows us that all the saved ones are God's dwelling place, that is, God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This house is different from the household or family we spoke of earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The household refers to the family, while the house refers to the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, Christians are collectively called the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are members one of another, and together we are the Body of Christ.</S>
