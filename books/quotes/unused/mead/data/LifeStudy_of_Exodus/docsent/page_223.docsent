   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY MAN S WORK A. Fallen Man Being Sin in the Eyes of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 20:25 says, And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we see that God does not allow man s work to have a part in the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The entire fallen man is sin pollution in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether we are cultured or uncultured, educated or uneducated, we are sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, no work of man is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man s work can do nothing other than pollute the worship of God, for man himself is pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not add anything of man to God s worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To add man s work to the cross is abominable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A prerequisite to the worship of God is having an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible clearly shows that if there is no altar, there can be no worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fallen man cannot worship God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to worship Him, we must pass through the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians realize that at the altar redemption is provided by means of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although this is true, the altar does more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The altar also terminates us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who worships God is terminated at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are a totality of sin, pollution, we should say when we come to worship God, Lord, cleanse me with the precious blood and cover me with Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, in myself I dare not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I come to worship You through Your cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wash me with Your redeeming blood and cover me with Yourself as my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because I am a fallen person, I dare not do anything, plan anything, or bring anything of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to have such a realization whenever we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although I have the boldness to preach the word of the Bible, I do not have the boldness to make proposals concerning matters in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever brothers come to me with a proposal, I encourage them to pray to learn whether or not this is truly of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that is of us is pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing of fallen man, therefore, should have a part in the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. No Work of Man Acceptable to God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because fallen man is pollution in the eyes of God, no work of man is acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cain was condemned because he brought his own work into the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He thought that he could bring something to God of what he had acquired through his labor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Cain did not realize that he was totally pollution in God s sight and that whatever came from him was also pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, what he offered to God was not acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, it was altogether abominable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anything that originates with us, anything which comes from our labor, is pollution and is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. The Addition of Man s Work to the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abominable to God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is an abomination to add man s work to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cross is wholly the work of God, and no human work is allowed to be added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 1:18 Paul says that the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is the cross foolishness to those who perish?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is foolishness because it is something crude, primitive, and altogether without culture, beauty, or human craftsmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Paul s time the cross was an instrument used to execute criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, God used such a means to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, this was a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 Corinthians 1:23 Paul says, We preach Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is significant that here Paul does not say that he preached Christ resurrected, ascended, glorified, or enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past I sometimes wondered why Paul did not tell the Greeks that he preached Christ ascended and exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, Paul preached Christ crucified; he preached One who was put to death on the cross, executed as if He were a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To Jews the preaching of Christ crucified is a stumbling block, and to Greeks it is foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, this Christ is God s power and God s wisdom v. 24 . Praise the Lord that we have been called to receive a crucified Christ! The decision to receive such a Christ did not originate with us; we have received Him because God has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God has predestined us to receive this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, after receiving Christ crucified, many Christians try to beautify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some have also attempted to make the church beautiful in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, for us to beautify anything in the Lord s recovery is to insult God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of beautifying things, we should remain in what man would consider a primitive, uncultured situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of hewn stones, we should have an altar of stones or earth created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such an altar is acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because we do not add man s work to the cross, but only have an altar that is primitive, the Lord s speaking is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not more capable or more intelligent than others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, because we do not give place to the work of man, the Lord continues to open His Word to us and to send forth His light.</S>
