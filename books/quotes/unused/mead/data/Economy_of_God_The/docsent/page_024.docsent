   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIGGING THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When someone is digging a deep well, many times he will discover that the earth is of many layers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One layer is of soft dirt, the next layer is of hard dirt, and another layer is of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is difficult to dig through a layer of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This illustrates the many layers in us through which we need to dig.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One layer is the conscience, another layer is the heart, and now a third layer is our mind, which holds much dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not know how many imaginations we have day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We not only dream during the night while we are asleep, but we also dream during the day while we are awake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All our imaginations are different dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have already spoken of Satan blinding our minds; he does this simply through our imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes while you are listening to a message, your mind travels to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Outwardly you nod your head, but inwardly your mind imagines something in space.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the message you hear the voice, but you do not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your mind has been blinded by imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times people travel completely around the world in their imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within seconds they travel through the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They can go to the Far East faster than the best jet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How many imaginations are in the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When there is a great deal of dirt in our mind, how can the flow of living water within us be free?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since our mind has been blocked, the living water also has been blocked in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heaps of dirt in our mind are simply the many thoughts, imaginations, and dreams, which must be dug away before the living water can freely flow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DIGGING THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The will also contains much dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are not many who are absolutely and utterly obedient to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be more submissive in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many times we do not submit ourselves to the Lord s sovereign arrangement!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we think we are quite submissive to the Lord, but when He puts us into certain circumstances, we are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easy to submit to the invisible Lord, but it is rather difficult to submit to visible persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may say, I am submissive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the Lord I have no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But...</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yes, there is a big but!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the Lord you may have no problem, but concerning the saints in the church, you may not be able to submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord especially put you into your local church in order to break your will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a sister you may think, If my husband could be such a dear brother, I would gladly submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How many times the sisters have had this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the fact is that your husband cannot be that kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord gave you such a suitable husband; he is just the husband you need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you could have the husband of your dreams, you would never be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many experiences and circumstances under the Lord s sovereignty simply expose us to the light so that we may know how stubborn our will is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may point out a certain brother who is stubborn, but every one of us is stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may be the most stubborn brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every one of us must dig his will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How easy it is to obtain more and more spiritual knowledge while we remain unchanged in our life, our nature, and our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a situation of utter failure!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the living water is to flow in us, we must be dug.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The flowing is the Lord s business, but the digging is our business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to dig ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>DIGGING THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After digging away the dirt from our will, we need to deal with our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not know how to illustrate how troublesome our emotion is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This trouble exists not only with the sisters but also with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we are emotional, we are occupied with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are under the control and bondage of our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would spend some time with the Lord and open ourselves, we must begin by digging our conscience, then our heart, then our mind, and then our will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finally, we will come to the point where we see how much we are still in our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is very easy for us to like one thing and dislike another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is very easy for us to make friends with a brother but treat him like an enemy the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not easy to change our will, but it is easy to have many changes in our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our emotions fluctuate even more than the weather.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My deep concern is not merely to give a message but to afford you a little instruction so that you will go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Forget about your needs, your job, your future, and your circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Seek only the Lord s presence, and ask Him to bring you into His light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then follow His light to dig away the dirt in your conscience, heart, mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more you dig away the dirt, the more you will be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You will be living, you will be strengthened, and you will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the key to solve your many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must maintain the flow of living water, that is, the fellowship of life flowing freely within you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the living water flows freely within you, there is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>By such a flow all the problems will be solved spontaneously and even unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although you may not know how to solve them, they will be solved by the flowing of the living water, the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This flowing of the living water is entirely dependent upon your digging.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This digging is accomplished only by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to spend more and more time with the Lord and pray according to His inner leading.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to that leading, we must confess and dig away all the dirt within us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe that these instructions are clear; now we need to practice them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Sometimes we need to pray with others, but the digging prayer is more prevailing in privacy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is extremely necessary to spend more private time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All the dirt within our conscience, heart, mind, will, and emotion must be dug away by our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You may say, I am very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But although we are busy with the duties of the day, we can still touch the Lord and dig away the dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many times while I am working, I apply myself to the exercise of digging.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should learn to pray, to contact the Lord, and to dig away all the inward dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Spring up, well, with water;</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Dig Thou, Lord, completely;</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Dig away all barriers</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That Thy stream flow through me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ, the Rock, is riven;</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Living water s flowing;</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But within my heart now</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is blocked from going.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I will dig by praying,</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Dig the dirt entirely,</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thus release the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Let the stream flow freely.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There s no need again that</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christ, the Rock, be riven,</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But unto the digging</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>That I should be given.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What I need most deeply</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Is the Spirit s filling,</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>That the living water</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>From my heart be welling.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Dig till there is nothing</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Left to block the passage;</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Dig until the stream flows</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>With the living message.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Spring up, well, with water;</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Dig Thou, Lord, completely;</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Dig away all barriers</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>That Thy stream flow through me.</S>
