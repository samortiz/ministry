   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Believing That the Lord s Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Has Put Satan to Shame</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Third, we must believe that the Lord s resurrection has put Satan to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan no longer has any way to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Colossians 2:12 says, Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse speaks of death as well as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 20 says, If you died with Christ, and 3:1 says, If therefore you were raised together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These verses begin with resurrection and end with resurrection, and the verses in between speak of triumphing in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We stand in the position of resurrection, and we triumph in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why can we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The statement we made earlier explains this: The Lord has died, and we also are dead in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan, who has dominion over the old man, can follow us only as far as the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection is beyond him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as Satan had nothing in the Lord Jesus while He was on earth John 14:30 , so also he has nothing in Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan has no place at all in the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has no authority at all in the new life and cannot touch our new life!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord was hung on the cross, it seemed as if myriads of demons were surrounding it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They thought that they could destroy the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was to have been their greatest victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is the glorious fact: The Lord has come out of death!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we have the boldness and the confidence to say that the life of God is well able to cast away death!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the resurrection life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The resurrection life is a life that cannot be touched by death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a life that transcends death, that is beyond the boundary of death, that comes out of death, and that death cannot hold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan s power extends only as far as death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus proved how great the power of His life is through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He dismantled the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible calls this power the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When this resurrection power is expressed through us, everything of Satan is cast down!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can withstand Satan because our life is a life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life has nothing to do with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our life issues from the life of God; it is a life that comes out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan s power only goes as far as death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever it does to us is limited to this side of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But our life has come out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have a life which he cannot touch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are standing on resurrection ground, and we look back in triumph through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Colossians 2 speaks of triumphing in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a chapter on resurrection, not death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not triumph in death through resurrection; rather we triumph in resurrection through death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to withstand Satan, every child of God must declare with a strong faith, Thank God, I have resurrected!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan, what can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What you can do goes only so far as death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the life that I have today has nothing to do with you!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This life has been tested by you already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What else can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are powerless!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life has transcended over you!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan, get away from me!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot deal with Satan on the ground of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can only stand on the ground of resurrection, the ground of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a very basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Colossians 2:12 tells us that we must believe in the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to take the same position before Satan as that which we take before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible tells us to put on the robe of righteousness when we come before God Isa 61:10; Zech 3:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our robe of righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to put on Christ to come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same way, we need to put on Christ to come before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God cannot find our sins when we put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Likewise, Satan cannot find our sins when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we take this stand, Satan can no longer attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are perfect before God and perfect also before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What a glorious fact!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must not be afraid of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are afraid of Satan, he will laugh at us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He will say, What a fool there is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How can this one be so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Anyone who is afraid of Satan is foolish, because he has forgotten his position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have no reason to fear him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have transcended over his power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can stand before him and say, You cannot touch me!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No matter how strong and resourceful you are, you are still one step behind!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the day of the Lord s resurrection, He led the enemy captive and openly shamed him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today we are standing on the ground of resurrection, and we triumph through the cross!</S>
