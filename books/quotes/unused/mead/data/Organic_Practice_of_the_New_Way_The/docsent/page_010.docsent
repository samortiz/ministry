   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING PEOPLE IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only do you have to feed a newly baptized one, but you must bring him to a nearby small group meeting as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You need to tell him, Christians are communal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are not like the butterflies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather they are like the bees and the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let me take you to see a group of Christians nearby.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, by bringing him to the small group meeting, you should not let the others take over your job; you have to continue feeding and caring for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning the small group meetings, I would first beg you to drop the all too legal practice that you have had before.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle of attending the small group meeting is the same as that for the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must be a person who is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before you go to the meeting, you must first pray and have yourself enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must confess your sins thoroughly and be filled with the Holy Spirit completely.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, you will be a praying, singing, and living person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The small group meeting should consist of the following five things: fellowship, prayer, mutual care, the teaching of the truth, and the guidance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Chinese are traditionally taught to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when we come to the small group meeting, the minute we see each other, we have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One may say, The Bible is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This morning I read Matthew chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name Jesus Christ is really sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another may say, Yes, I also realize that Jesus Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, maybe I could share something with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I don t know why, but for the whole day today, I have had a problem with coughing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the fellowship begins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps by that time not everyone has arrived yet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You do not have to wait for everyone to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead you can start praying, O Lord, remember our brother s cough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the prayer, perhaps one brother would say that he has a good remedy, that it is not expensive, but is very effective, and that this brother can try it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what we mean by mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, the brothers and sisters will get to know each other and will care for each other like members of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This way will capture, support, and perfect people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brother that you have invited may ask a question, I have read the Bible, and I have listened to you speaking on justification and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what do all these terms mean?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once this question is raised up, everyone will answer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After one finishes, another may add on, with more points.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The older and more mature ones can speak something deeper at the end. We must build up an atmosphere where everyone answers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, everyone speaks and will not take up much time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps some may bring out a question, What does the life of God mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone begins to answer again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the answer there is the teaching of the truth as well as the guidance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year there is this kind of teaching week after week in the small group meetings, everyone will receive much edification in truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, everyone will be able to tell others about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what we mean by an organic practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those that we have begotten through the gospel are nourished in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are also taught in the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This teaching is the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is like the perfecting of a soldier in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, he is taught the marches and the steps.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then, he is equipped from head to foot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lastly, he is provided with guns and bullets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the perfecting described in Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that the brothers and sisters would not merely listen to these words, but that you would set your mind before God to practice these points.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, we must go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Second, we must nourish the newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Third, we must bring them to the small group meetings that they may receive the fellowship, the intercession, the care, the teaching, and the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To do this, we must first consecrate our time before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every week we have to set aside two evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In principle, one evening is for saving people, and the other is for the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord will surely bless this kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 12, 1989</S>
