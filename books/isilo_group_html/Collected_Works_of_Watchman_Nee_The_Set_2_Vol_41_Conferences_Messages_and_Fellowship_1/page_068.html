Based on these two categories, there are two kinds of ministries. The first category includes gifts that enable one to work for the Lord, and the second category includes gifts that enable one to bear local responsibilities. All gifts and ministries belong to one of these two categories. Everyone has his own ministry from the Lord. Those who work for the Lord give themselves full time to do God's work, while those who take responsibility locally handle practical affairs. Even an ordinary brother or sister has a ministry. Acts 6 mentions the difference between these two kinds of ministries. There are two kinds of work in the church&mdash;one is spiritual and the other is physical. The former has to do with spiritual things such as the apostolic ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word. The latter has to do with business affairs such as Stephen's ministry of serving tables.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING CLEAR ABOUT ONE'S OWN MINISTRY</h2><p>Here I have to say a strong word to the co-workers. You must all be clear about your own ministry. Before you find what your specific ministry is, you should first find which category of ministry you belong to. Do you belong to the ministry that sets itself apart for the Lord's work, or do you belong to the ministry that bears local responsibility? Should you give yourself to prayer and the preaching of the word? Or should you serve tables? Is your ministry spiritual or physical? These are big questions. Peter said that they would give themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word; this is the spiritual ministry. Later, they appointed seven deacons to take care of the business side of the work.</p><p>We must be clear as to which category of ministry the Lord has called us before we can ask what specific ministry we have. This holds true for all the responsible brothers in all the localities. They have to be clear about the ministry that God has assigned to them. If you are not clear about this, you will have no way to know what your personal ministry is. How many among us are truly clear about the ministry that God has called us into? We must pray carefully before the Lord. We all have our own ministry. The category of our service and our personal function before the Lord depend upon His calling.</p><p>If you are clear that the Lord has called you to a ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word, you have to strive towards this goal. If you are not clear, you should remain in the other category of ministry. In the denominations, many preachers are not abiding in the ministry that God has assigned to them. If the Lord has not appointed you to a ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word, you must never put yourself into it by your own fleshly strength. The Lord will only supply His own appointed ministries. He will only bless those who abide in His assigned ministries. If you do not abide in the ministry that the Lord has assigned, He will not supply or bless you. This does not mean that only those who are in the ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word can pray or preach the word. Stephen was not in the ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word, yet he did the work of the ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word wherever he went. The important thing is to be clear about your own ministry and to abide by this ministry.</p><p>If someone thinks that he has the ministry of prayer and the preaching of the word, and if he sets out to preach and work, the Bible does not forbid his activities. In Philippians 1 Paul said that he rejoiced as long as Christ was preached by whatever means (v. 18). Of course, we cannot call such ones our co-workers or lay hands on them. The local brothers who are responsible should forbid ones who have never received the laying on of hands to preach in their local meetings. Of course, to a certain extent, they should be allowed to work, but they should not be allowed to become too active.</p><p>If we cannot decide whether or not to lay hands on a certain person, we can delay the action and wait for the Lord's vindication of his work before we lay our hands on him. If God does not show any clear vindication, we should tell him in a frank way, "We are sorry, but the brothers cannot lay hands on you."</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
