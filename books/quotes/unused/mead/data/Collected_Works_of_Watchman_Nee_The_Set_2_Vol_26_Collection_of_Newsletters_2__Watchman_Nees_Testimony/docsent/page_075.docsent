   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Beginning of Revival</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of 1923, we started to hold meetings in Foochow in a pavilion of a brother's house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Stools were collected from various places when needed, and we went about the neighborhood inviting people to come and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the Lord had started something, it was easy for many people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our method of inviting people was rather effective: each brother wore a white vest bearing words like "You shall die" in the front and "Believe in Jesus to be saved" at the back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were other similar slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With banners in our hands, we paraded everywhere, singing as we marched along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who saw us marveled, and in this way, many people were brought to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We marched this way every day, and every day people came to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They filled the sitting room, the kitchen, and outside the pavilion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We had rented some stools for the meeting, but the rental period expired after two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the time was up, we had no money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The stools had to be returned to the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Must the meeting be suspended?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I announced that anybody who wished to attend the meeting in the future would have to bring his own stool.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That afternoon, the whole hill, Tsang Chien Hill, was the scene of people, old and young, boys and girls, carrying stools.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the policemen were amazed at the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank the Lord, through His special blessing, a few hundred people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On that occasion the foundation of salvation was laid down clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Until that time, many believers in China had not been clear about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was through those meetings and the preaching of our brothers in various places that many have since come to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Renting Premises for the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we had been holding meetings for about a month, some young brothers among us felt that we should have a proper place to meet in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But since we were short of money, it was beyond our means to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I went to school to talk the matter over with several brothers, that is, with brothers Faithful Luke, Simon Meek, and Wang Tze, and we agreed that we should continue our work among the students.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then for the first time I rented some premises, a place owned by a family named Ho, all the members of which had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They agreed to rent the place to me for a monthly amount of only nine dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I then prayed with several brothers, asking God to supply the three months' rent which was needed in advance before we could move in.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every Saturday I went to Ma-kiang, Fukien, to listen to Miss Margaret Barber's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This time when I saw her, she said, "Here is twenty-seven dollars, which a friend asked me to give you for your work."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This sum was exactly sufficient for three months' rent at nine dollars per month not too much and not too little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On my return, without hesitation, I paid the three months' rent in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, we prayed again, and the Lord provided again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the beginning of the work in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Revival of Many Believers</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have never seen a revival greater than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, there were people being saved every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It looked as if anyone who contacted us would immediately be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every morning at five o'clock, when I arrived at school, I saw people everywhere reading the Bible more than one hundred of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Reading novels had been very fashionable, but now those who wanted to could only do so secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, Bible reading now became an honorable thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were eight classes in our school, each with a prefect and a deputy prefect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was amazing to see that the prefect of practically every class had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even all the famous athletes had been saved, among whom was Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi, the tennis champion of Fukien province for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our headmaster admired us for everything we did.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only thing he lamented was our attitude towards the Anglican church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The headmaster was a member of the Anglican church, but we refused to belong to that denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>More than sixty people daily marched in procession carrying banners, and a few dozen also went around daily distributing tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The whole town of Foochow about a hundred thousand people was shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many brothers who were saved were immediately baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At this time, we began to meet according to the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was the way the meeting in Foochow started.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later the number of believers increased, and the work in the villages also began.</S>
