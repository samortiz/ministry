        <h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST,<br />
AND LOVE BEING THE EXPRESSION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless&rdquo; (13:8). Only love is eternal, lasts forever, because love is out of life. Hence, Paul says, &ldquo;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing&rdquo; (vv. 1-3). In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must love one another. The love in 1 Corinthians 13 is life; the expression of life is love.</p>
<p>In Ephesians there are two phrases that are two sides of one thing. These two phrases are <em>in love</em> (1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2) and <em>in spirit</em> (2:22; 3:5; 5:18; 6:18). What is within is the spirit, and what is expressed is love. There is also another phrase&mdash;<em>in Christ</em> (1:3, 10, 12; 4:32). If we are not in spirit, we cannot be in Christ or in love. The Spirit is the reality of Christ, and love is the expression of the Spirit. These are our touchstones. Our being in the Spirit depends on our being in love. If we are in love, we are of the Lord and in the Spirit, and our love will be pure. Such love is the expression of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. If we are in love, we are in the Spirit, not in knowledge or gifts. In the sphere of love, life is rich and flourishing.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 8:1). Much knowledge puffs people up. Only love can build people up and edify people. Love can build up the church and build us into the church. Without love, we are sounding brass and clanging cymbals; that is, we are lifeless, and we are useless to the church. The less love we have, the more we damage the church. It is not the card players or the moviegoers who damage the building but those who are without love, even though they can preach according to knowledge and gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCEPTING GOD&rsquo;S ARRANGEMENT AND<br />
LEARNING TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Several co-workers and I have been seeking the Lord and fellowshipping concerning the responsible brothers in a certain locality. We feel that five middle-aged brothers and two elderly brothers should be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; together so that they bear responsibility together. These seven brothers have not coordinated together in the past, but now that they are bearing responsibility together, they must be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; together to the extent that they love one another. These brothers should say, &ldquo;Lord, give us love. We need to love one another. We may be wrong, but You are never wrong. You have placed us here and bound us together. We thank and praise You that we were born into Your family and have seen the vision. We will never escape.&rdquo; These brothers should be &ldquo;disarmed&rdquo; and love one another. Whether or not they are willing, as soon as they are bound together, love will abound.</p>
<p>I appreciate the traditional Chinese marriages. After living in America for many years, I feel that modern marriages have many problems. There is too much choice and freedom in modern marriages. The young men and women do not listen to their parents. Hence, two people can take an interest in each other if they have the same taste or temperament. According to statistics, the percentage of divorces and separations in such free, modern marriages is quite high. The reason such marriages fail is that there is too much freedom and self-choice. The old-fashioned Chinese marriages bound two people together whether they loved each other or not. This might seem harsh, but the percentage of couples who remained together is high.</p>
<p>When I was young, the phrase <em>a match made in heaven</em> was posted in my hometown every time someone got married. Such marriages were arranged by the parents but were called a match made in heaven. Because the young man and the young woman recognized that their marriage was the will of heaven, they accepted the marriage. They did not need other people or pastors to ask whether they loved each other; both parties believed that since the marriage was the will of heaven, it would be blessed by heaven. There was no choice in such old-fashioned Chinese marriages; there was only complete resignation to the will of heaven. As a result, the matches were free of problems. If left to choice, a young man or woman might choose a good counterpart but see a better one after several months or an even better one several years later. How can a person decide? Who has the assurance that his insight will give him the best choice? A young woman might choose someone with a dignified appearance, only to suffer later because he has a crooked heart. If the door of choice is closed at the beginning, everything will be the &ldquo;will of heaven,&rdquo; and the result will be heaven-made matches that are happy and free of problems. Brother Nee once said that the young people should open their eyes wide and make thorough observations before getting engaged, but they should close their eyes and be blind as well as deaf after they are engaged and married. I would further say that it is better for the young people to be blind and deaf even while they are looking for a spouse.</p>
<p>The young people are in the age of science and may not believe my word. They may think that I am too old-fashioned and completely out of touch with the current of the age. However, I have fifty years of experience and have observed much in northern China, southern China, Taiwan, and the United States. Those with strong opinions in choosing a spouse do not necessarily have a good outcome. During the last twenty years in the United States I have seen at least five hundred couples get married. Those who were choosy usually had a bad outcome, but for those who were simple, things usually turned out well. By simple I mean that these ones did not choose on their own but gave the matter to God. They often said, &ldquo;Lord, I was made by You. My future is in Your hands. You know who would be a good and suitable spouse for me. I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have likened the change of responsible brothers in a locality to marriage. These seven brothers need to be firmly bound together and love one another. My desire, however, is not an order; if these brothers have the same desire, they will begin to love one another. If they accept this change and are bound together in the service, love will follow. They should love one another and not choose. Choosing will open a back door for the enemy to come in and work. I hope that these seven brothers will commit themselves into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, forget the past, coordinate together, and love one another. If they are willing to do this, they will be blessed.</p>
<p>Forgetting is a principle in the Bible. In forgiving us of our sins, God forgets our sins (Heb. 8:12). Therefore, we also should forgive one another (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13). In the Bible to forgive is to forget. Only when something is forgotten is it truly forgiven.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul says, &ldquo;One thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before&rdquo; (Phil. 3:13). In the future when we are in the new heaven and the new earth, we will only remember how we repented, got saved, enjoyed the Lord, and fellowshipped with the saints. We will not remember any hate, jealousy, or strife. We will remember the good things but have no memory of the bad things. Therefore, we should live in the new heaven and the new earth today. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; When we forget the things that are behind, the things of yesterday, we will love one another.</p>
<p>If we do not have love but claim to be in spirit, we are performing. We must have love in order to be in spirit. To be in spirit is to be in Christ. I hope that the brothers who are coordinating and serving together would love one another. Love does not take account of evil and does not take account of people&rsquo;s shortcomings; love forgets the bad and forgets the past. If we would be in love, the local churches would be blessed, full of life, and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We would benefit, and others would benefit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
