   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s salvation includes all the topics we previously covered, such as forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, release, and other such blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person who receives these heavenly blessings in Christ is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in the Bible God speaks of at least five kinds of salvation, and if we do not clearly distinguish between these five kinds of salvation, we will be confused about what the Bible says about salvation.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our works have absolutely nothing to do with eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our works could gain eternal salvation for us, it would be easy for us to boast in ourselves.</S>
