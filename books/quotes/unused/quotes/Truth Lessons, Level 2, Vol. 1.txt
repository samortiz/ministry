In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament
In this lesson we will begin with the first covenant that God made with man , that is, the covenant that God made with the created man
He always is and never changes, He always exists and never passes away, and He is self-existing and ever-existing
His faithfulness is the guarantee of the covenant that He made with man; His might enables Him to fulfill His covenant with man
The created man still needed to receive the uncreated divine life from God that God's eternal purpose might be accomplished in man
When man first came out of God's creating hand, he was not crooked, evil, or defiled, but upright, good, and clean
Zechariah 121 says that Jehovah stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him
After man was created, God did not require him to do anything; He assigned him only to dress and to guard His garden on earth
Man was charged to dress the garden of God, that is, to cultivate the garden of God so that it might not be ruined
God's eternal intention is to work Himself into man, whom He created, to be man's life and content that He may have a corporate expression
If man eats properly, he receives God into him subjectively to be joined and mingled with him, thus fulfilling God's purpose in creating man
God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he would eat of it he would surely die
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and death; it includes good, evil, and knowledge
If man were to contact it, he would touch the source of sin and death, and this would surely issue in sin and death
Just as man could receive the tree of life by eating, so also he could receive the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by eating
Because of the serpent's temptation, man violated God's covenant and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Man misunderstood God's love, doubted God's heart, ignored God's word, and thereby ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Being subjected under Satan's authority and obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air , man became a son of disobedience
He lay under Satan's hand , being oppressed and controlled by Satan, being slaughtered as Satan pleased, and having no freedom
After man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and received Satan, he had sin and death
As Romans 5:12 says, 'Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men
Sin entered into man and dwelt in man's body , causing man's body to become damaged and transmuted into the flesh
Having been seduced by the serpent, man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, received Satan, and had sin and death
The result of man's fall was that he was driven out of the Garden of Eden and was kept away from the tree of life
The sword in Genesis 3 indicates that to be killed is the punishment meted out to the sinner by God's righteousness
In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament
In the Old Testament, after man's creation, God made the first covenant with man; after man's fall He made the second covenant with man
Jehovah, the One who made the covenant, was such a God who came to the place of fallen man to seek and to call fallen man
God's intention was that man should exercise his free will to choose the tree of life and reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The fallen man's spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God; eventually even man's body died
Through the offense of one man Adam sin entered into the world and sin brought in death so death ruled over all men causing all men to die
Although man fell into such a tragic and hopeless condition, God came to visit him and to make a covenant with him
It was not until man committed sin and became fallen that he became aware of his nakedness that is he knew his sinfulness and shamefulness
Since the skirts made of fig leaves would have withered, broken, and soon dropped off, they could not cover his nakedness in the eyes of God
In this covenant God also promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent , that is, cause its death
The entire process of childbearing, including pregnancy, delivery, and child-rearing, is a suffering to a woman
God arranged especially that the desire of the woman's heart would be to her husband and that the woman would be ruled by her husband
After they had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve knew that they would surely die
Instead of sentencing them to death, God gave them a wonderful promise, that the seed of the woman was to come
After Adam heard this word, he immediately called his wife's name Eve , which means 'living' or 'life' in Hebrew
Since Adam believed in what was promised in Gods covenant God made coats of the skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them
On the cross Christ was killed by the righteous God, shedding His precious blood to satisfy the requirement of God's righteousness upon man
When God clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of the sacrifice, He clothed them with Christ as their righteousness to cover them completely
Christ as Gods righteousness covered them that they the fallen sinners might be justified and accepted by God and have fellowship with God
Such faith must have issued from the word preached by his parents, for faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ
He did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God's way of redemption
Cain was presumptuous in that he forsook God's way of redemption and presented produce without the shedding of blood as an offering to God
When Cain saw that God was pleased with Abel but not with him, he became jealous and very angry and his countenance fell
In the beginning Cain worshipped God; then he became jealous, angry, and hateful, and eventually he committed murder
As a result, he was cast out of the presence of God and produced a culture that corrupted his descendants and that was judged by God
He also promised that the seed of the woman, Christ, would come to bruise the serpent's head, that is, to cause Satan's death
Eventually, Adam believed in what was promised in God's covenant and called his wife Eve, meaning 'living' or 'life'
By faith Abel received God's way of redemption, offering the sacrifice with the shedding of blood and being accepted by God
After God judged the corrupt generation by the flood and saved Noah out of that generation, He made the third covenant with man
He built the ark to save himself and his entire family, and he was saved through water, being delivered from that corrupt generation
Because he found grace in the eyes of God, this grace strengthened him and helped him to live a righteous life
During that period of time, he must have experienced a great deal of opposition, criticism, mockery, and condemnation
Here was a man who offered burnt offerings according to God's pleasure and was accepted by God, making God happy and satisfied
In the covenant which He made with Noah and his sons, God first told them to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth
In this covenant God also charged man to have dominion over every living creature of the heavens, of the earth, and of the sea
Man was brought back to his original position, having the authority to represent God and to rule over all things for Him
Before the flood God ordained that man should eat only herbs and fruits of the trees , that is, that he should eat vegetables and not meat
After the fall, man became sinful, so he needed the redemption with the shedding of blood that he might live in the presence of God
When the Lord Jesus came, He said that His blood was drinkable, for His blood truly can redeem us from sins that we may receive His life
Eventually the whole earth was filled with violence so that God destroyed the human race by the flood preserving only Noahs family of eight
Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth'
God's faithfulness is the guarantee that God will keep His covenant and that a flood will no more come to destroy man
Genesis 8:22 mentions eight items of the blessing, including seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night
He began to misuse the God-given authority to make himself the king, to rule over others, and to form a kingdom
Satan caused man to misuse the God-given authority to form nations and instigated man to rebel against God with the nations
Before the incident at Babel, there were only individuals opposing God on the earth; men had not reached the extent of organized rebellion
At this point, man had fallen to the uttermost so that even God could not do anything to recover the fallen race
He always is and never changes, and He always exists and never passes away; He is the self-existing and ever-existing One
The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel and filled the tabernacle and temple
It separated him from the world unto God , and was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God
While Abram was living in Ur, the God of glory suddenly appeared to him, telling him to go out of his land and from his relatives
Finally, it was Terah, Abram's father, who brought the whole family out of Ur of Chaldea to go to the land of Canaan
Because Abram hesitated again to answer God's call and remained there, God had no choice but to take away his father also
On the positive side, He told him to go to the place that He would show him, implying a promise, the promise of the good land
At Babel, man had abused the God-given authority to form nations , but here God promised to make Abram a great nation
In contrast to them, Abram did not have to do anything for himself; God would bless him and make his name great
Instead of remaining there by the mercy of God, he went downward toward the south, even down to Egypt, because of the famine
After Jehovah God made a covenant with Abram the third time, Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre
God called Abram with the intention of gaining a kingdom to exercise His authority on earth and to express His glory
Only when there is a seed can there be the kingdom; without the seed, there is no possibility to produce the kingdom
In order to fulfill God's purpose, a seed was needed, and the seed had to be of the promise of God and had to be born of Abram
God promised Abram not only that he would bear a son of himself but that his seed would be as many as the stars in heaven
When God promised Abram that he would have a seed, Abram immediately believed, and God counted his faith as righteousness and justified him
In the process of making the covenant, God appeared as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch, passing through the pieces of the sacrifices
In making a covenant with Abram, God changed Abram's name to Abraham that he might be the father of many nations
In changing Abram's name to Abraham that he might be the father of many nations, God's intention was to gain a kingdom through him
God promised once again to give the whole land of Canaan to Abraham and to his seed as their eternal possession
By 'my' being removed, she was changed from being narrow to being broad, thus becoming a mother of many nations
The birth of Isaac was not the result of Abraham and Sarah's energy; it was absolutely the result of God's gracious visitation
After God made a covenant with Abraham the fifth time, Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose
In such a sweet fellowship with God, Abraham received revelation from Him regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom
After this, Abraham journeyed again toward the south, repeating his old failure and exposing his hidden weakness
These two peoples eventually will be built together, constituting the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity
God did not say that all nations would be blessed in Abraham's seeds, as concerning many, but in his seed, as concerning one, who is Christ
In Christ man is justified , in Christ man is sanctified , and in Christ man receives the promise of the Spirit
He experienced God's keeping grace and learned the lesson that God took care of him in everything and that everything was in God's hand
Again, preserved by God's sovereign care, he was able to deal with the circumstances, that the testimony of God's grace might be maintained
The house of Jacob, his descendants, all left the land of promise and went down to Egypt, falling under the tyranny and bondage of Egypt
When the children of Israel were under the tyranny and slavery of the Egyptians, God heard His people's cry and came down to deliver them
Because Pharaoh would not allow the children of Israel to go out of Egypt, God through Moses sent ten plagues to punish the Egyptians
God sent the tenth plague, through which He smote all the firstborn, in order to demonstrate His power and accomplish His saving way
The manna sent from heaven is a type of Christ as the heavenly food to God's people that they might become heavenly people
The living water from the cleft rock is a type of Christ becoming the Spirit to quench the thirst of God's people for their satisfaction
The eagles' wings signify the grace of God by which they went out of Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness
God revealed this way of redemption again to the children of Israel in the matter of their keeping the Passover
Through the tabernacle and the offerings, both of which typify Christ, they were blessed to enjoy God as their eternal portion
It was according to the way of His redemption and the promise of His grace that Jehovah God led and dwelt among the children of Israel
At Mount Sinai God made a covenant with those who did not know themselves, the fifth covenant that He made with man
All the way to Mount Sinai the children of Israel truly enjoyed God's redemption, His powerful deliverance, and the leading of His grace
God gave the law to the children of Israel as a covenant that He made with them and through which He also revealed Himself to them
The fourth commandment is that man should remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, for the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah God
The fifth commandment is that man should honor his father and mother, that his days may be long in the land which Jehovah God has given him
The sixth commandment says, 'Thou shalt not kill'; the seventh, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery'; and the eighth, 'Thou shalt not steal'
The fifth commandment, concerning the honoring of parents, is ranked with the first four commandments, related to God Himself
Their stress is on man's worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations related to man's relationship with God
The emphasis is on the verdicts that concern the relationships between man and others and between man and God as recorded in Exodus 2112319
Verse 12 of chapter twenty-three sets forth the fourth commandment on keeping the Sabbath and gives the verdict concerning this matter
It is only at night or during winter, when the green pasture is not available, that the sheep are guarded and protected in the fold
In ancient times, a child-conductor was one who cared for a child under age and conducted him to the schoolmaster
According to the law, he must be condemned and even be put to death, since the law exposed his sin and condemned him
Exodus 24:4-5 says, 'And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill
He sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord'
He did not ask them to swear that they would keep the law; rather, He told Moses to build an altar and to offer sacrifices
Because man was unable to keep God's commandments, he needed Christ to be the burnt offering and the peace offering
For this reason, when this covenant was made, Moses built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, which typify Christ
Exodus 24:6 says, 'And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar'
The covenant being impossible because of the weakness of man , God promised to make a new covenant with the children of Israel
Among the children of Israel who received the covenant, some became the just men who were made perfect by God in the Old Testament
These items signify Christ as man's life supply in different aspects, by which God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai
He also instructed them to build the tabernacle as His dwelling place that His glory might be concretely expressed on a large scale
The Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face
Eventually, the old generation of the children of Israel suffered God's punishment and were strewn along in the wilderness
The new generation of the children of Israel were considered by the old generation to be a prey and to be too weak to enter Canaan
All the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses, saying, 'Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt!
Wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey'?
When God forsook the old generation of the children of Israel, He promised to bring their children into the good land of Canaan
God's intention was for the children of Israel to keep His law by loving Him and His word and by becoming one with Him
When God entered into a covenant again with the new generation of the children of Israel, He did not forget this betrothal
The fruit of their body would be cursed, and the fruit of their ground, the increase of their cattle, and the young of their flock
He would bring them into the good land which their fathers possessed, and He would do them good and multiply them above their fathers
For His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime; weeping may last for the night, but joy comes in the morning
The new generation of the children of Israel, like their fathers, turned away from God through all their generations
They were cursed and suffered calamities, and God delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight
At that time they will look up and see their Savior, the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, the One whom they have pierced
They will be the priests in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, teaching the nations, who will be the citizens, to serve God
If they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, they would live and be blessed and prosper in all things
At that time God made a covenant with him through Nathan the prophet, the seventh covenant that God made with man
He has the authority to rule over all nations, and His hand holds the authority to remove kings and to set up kings
Eli knew the iniquity of his sons, who brought a curse upon themselves, yet he did not restrain them , for he honored them above God
He submitted himself to the God-ordained authority , fought for the interest of God, and established the kingdom of God
Because of God's presence, David defeated the Philistines, the Moabites, the Syrians, the Edomites , and the Ammonites
God promised David that He would set up his seed after him and that He would establish the kingdom and throne of his seed
As a type of Christ, Solomon mainly did two things: he built the house of God in the kingdom and he spoke the words of wisdom
As the Son of God with the deity of God, He came to be the Christ of God to fulfill the covenant which God made with David
God promised David that if his seed would commit iniquity, He would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed
In his old age lusting after his foreign wives he forsook God and followed his foreign wives to worship idols thus committing a grievous sin
The word of God conveyed by the archangel Gabriel also confirmed that the covenant of David was fulfilled in Christ
After Solomon succeeded to the throne of David, he built the holy temple according to the pattern that his father had seen
At this point, God not only obtained a kingdom to express His authority, but He also gained a house to express His glory
The foreign wives turned away his heart after other gods, and he rebuilt the high places for the foreign images
Because of his son Solomon's wickedness, David's kingdom lost ten tribes and the nation of Israel was thus divided into two
At that time God made a covenant with him through Nathan the prophet, the seventh covenant that God made with man
The one with whom the covenant was made was David, a man after God's heart and the one who prevailed against the enemies to become the king
His seed would build a house for God's name, and God would be a Father to his seed, Christ, and his seed would be a son to God
If his seed would commit iniquity, God would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed
When both parts were carried away to the nations, the kingdom of David became the tabernacle that has fallen, and his throne was suspended
When Christ, the seed of David, comes again, He will rebuild the tabernacle that has fallen and will succeed to the throne to reign forever
He died and shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption for the sins of all men, thus enacting the new covenant
The One who made the new covenant is the Lord Jesus, who shed His blood to accomplish redemption for the sins of all men
The One who made the new covenant is also God , who had promised Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him
He did not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one, 'And to your seed,' who is Christ
The ones with whom the covenant was made are all the sinners , who are the descendants of fallen Adam, sinners who must die
It is with such ones who sin and do evil according to Satan, transgressors who deserve death, that God made a covenant
Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God's righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God's righteousness
Based upon this propitiation, God forgives the sins of all those who believe in Christ, and He does not remember their iniquities anymore
The third item of the contents of the new covenant is that God will be God to them and they will be a people to Him
Because the divine life enters into us to quicken our spirit, we can use our spirit to worship God, enjoy God, and fellowship with God
The fourth item of the contents of the new covenant is that they all will know God and will not need anyone to teach them
Anyone who partakes of the life of God and who has the law of life in him can know God subjectively from within
When a person intends to bequeath his possessions, he lists his possessions in a will and bequeaths them to the inheritor
As the Surety of the new covenant, Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all the New Testament believers
It is not like the old covenant, which was consummated with the blood of bulls and goats which cannot take away sins
They have been delivered from the eternal penalty of sin, and they have been freed from the bondage and power of sin
These bequests which the Lord bequeathed to the believers are inexhaustible and are for them to enjoy unto eternity
God's work of creation was to prepare all the materials for His work of building, that is, for the work of the new creation
In God's plan, He decided to accomplish His work of building by means of all things; therefore, He created all things
God created man in His image and likeness that man might have His life to become His expression and to represent Him in His dominion
He left a part, even the most central part, of His creating work incomplete; that is, He did not put His life into man
His intention was that man should exercise his free will to choose to receive the tree of life, thereby obtaining God's life
In order that the fallen man might receive His redemption in Christ, God came to the place of the fallen man to seek him and to call him
Adam believed God's promise, and God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them to cover their nakedness
Although he knew that God used the skin of the sacrifice as man's clothing, he presumptuously rejected God's way of redemption
Although he knew that man needed redemption with the shedding of blood, he refused to adopt God's way of salvation
Rather, according to his own idea and method, he offered produce to God without the shedding of blood and was thus rejected by God
Eventually, this culture caused his descendants to become so wholly corrupted that they were judged by God through the flood
God desired that those whom He redeemed would call upon the name of Jehovah, receiving their supply from Him and enjoying His riches
Man lived directly under this divine government, living and walking according to the guidance of God's presence
According to the truth of the entire Bible and also according to our experience, when God created man, He created a conscience in man
Eventually God used the flood to bring in the judgment of destruction, rescuing only the eight members of the house of Noah
Because man was neither subject to God's government nor obedient to self-government, God had to give man authority to rule over others
Satan utilized the authority that God gave man to form nations and to instigate a rebellion of the nations against God
They intended to build a tower that would reach into heaven in order to make themselves a name and to reject, to deny, God's name
God's calling of Abraham indicated that His work on man had turned from the created Adamic race to the called Abrahamic race
God did not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one, 'And to your seed,' who is Christ
God's original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace
Four hundred thirty years after He gave Abraham the promise the descendants of Abraham the chosen people of God became foolish and stubborn
After He gave the law to the children of Israel, He began to deal with them according to the law through the offerings and the tabernacle
Through Moses God gave the law as the custodian of His chosen people, to guard them as the sheepfold guards the flock
Persons such as Moses, Samuel, David, and the prophets and saints in the Old Testament were all kept by the law in this way
As the child-conductor of God's chosen people, the law also led them to obtain God's forgiveness through the offerings
The psalmists were devout people who were instructed by the law and who were forgiven by God through the offerings
They were planted in the house of Jehovah they flourished in the courts of God they brought forth fruits and they were full of sap and green
They were abundantly satisfied with the fatness of His house, and they drank of the river of His pleasures, enjoying His riches
God originally did not have the intention to deal with man according to the law rather the law was added because of mans fall and corruption
God gave the law to the children of Israel, not for them to keep but for them to transgress, in order to expose their wickedness
God's intention in giving them the law was that they would transgress it so that their offense might be shown, even that it might abound
The negative aspect of the function of the law is that man may have the knowledge of sin and thereby flee to Christ
Since the law causes man to have the knowledge of sin, it causes him to know himself and thereby sense his need of God's grace
Under the exposure of the law, man knows that he is fleshly, that he is sold under sin , and that in his flesh nothing good dwells
What he does, he does not acknowledge; what he wills, this he does not practice; but what he hates, this he does
Eventually according to the requirements of the law He went to the cross to accomplish redemption for God terminating and replacing the law
These as Zachariah and Elizabeth were righteous and blameless in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances
God's original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace
The dispensation of grace is from Christ's first coming to His second coming, which marks the beginning of the millennial kingdom
His essence consists of the divine nature plus the human nature, that is, the divine essence plus the human essence
The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet God's demand
On the one hand He experienced the hardships and sufferings of human living on the other hand He lived out God and expressed God in humanity
He lived as a man, yet He lived out God; He was the Triune God with all His virtues lived out in humanity and manifested in human form
He died on the cross with a sevenfold status to accomplish an all-inclusive death for all men and for everything that He redeemed
He died as the last Adam , as a man in the old creation, for us, who are in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross
The six items above are on the negative side, the side of redemption, and solve all problems for us, the fallen sinners
Through death and resurrection God caused His only begotten Son to be born as the Firstborn of God in His humanity in resurrection
Through resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit; then He breathed Himself into those who believed in Him to make them His members
He breathed Himself into the disciples to be the reality of their spiritual life for their spiritual existence and living
Such a Christ, who passed through death, entered into resurrection, and became the Spirit, is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
Afterwards, on Mount Olivet, outside of Jerusalem, He ascended into heaven in a cloud before the eyes of the disciples
He was exalted by God to the throne of Gods dominion to rule over and administrate the universe for God and was crowned with glory and honor
God made Him both Lord and Christ that He might possess all and that He might carry out God's commission and accomplish God's plan
It is the gospel of life because it manifests life and incorruption and regenerates man, imparting the divine life into man
God is constituting all those who have believed into this gospel and are saved and regenerated to be the churches in different places
He passed through human life in humanity, experiencing every hardship and suffering, and He also lived out the Triune God in humanity
He was made both Lord and Christ to be a Leader and Savior, that He might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people
God then constitutes them to be the churches in different localities that the Body of Christ may be fully built up
God obtains all those who believe into Christ in the New Testament to be the third part of the new race in God's new creation
In this dispensation, righteousness will reign as king; hence, this dispensation is also called the dispensation of righteousness
Such men were Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and others who were perfected by God in the Old Testament, as mentioned in Hebrews 11
There are different crowns the crown of righteousness the crown of life the crown of glory the incorruptible crown and the crown of joy
It is called the crown of righteousness because it will be given by the Lord, the righteous Judge, to His faithful lovers
In order to run the Lord's way, they forsake all the temporary things of this world, things which are corruptible and which will pass away
When the Lord rules over the world, He will give them authority over the nations, and they will reign over them with Him
If we can endure sufferings and difficulties for the Lord in this age, we will also reign with Him in the coming age
The Scriptures contain many conditions for obtaining the reward, but in this lesson we will mention only the more important ones
Since the Lord's giving us a reward will be according to His righteousness, our obtaining the reward must be according to our own labor
After we are saved, if what we produce before the Lord is gold, silver, and precious stones , the Lord will give us a reward
In the Bible, gold refers to the divine nature , silver, to redemption , and precious stones, to the expression of God's glorious image
Because of this, they will receive the crown of life to enjoy the glory of life and not be hurt by the second death
Those who are not able to be the overcomers in this age of desolation will not be able to be the rulers in the coming age of restoration
At the time he wrote 2 Timothy, he had reached the end of his course and was about to suffer martyrdom for the Lord
Many believers think that when the Lord comes back, at the time of the millennium, all the problems will have been resolved
To be sure, today the Lord also chastens and disciplines the believers , but He will do so even more at His coming back
God will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation
The peoples of the new race will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity
God will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation
