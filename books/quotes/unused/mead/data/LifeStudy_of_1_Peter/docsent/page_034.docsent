   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWELVE THE FULL SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ITS ISSUES 7 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:15, 18-19 BECOMING HOLY IN ALL OUR MANNER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we go on to verses 18 and 19, I would like to say a further word concerning the matter of becoming holy in all our manner of life 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The phrase manner of life is a literal translation of the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 1:15, we should not merely be holy and live a holy life; we should become holy in all our manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others should be able to see a certain manner in our living, and this manner should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that we are holy occasionally or that we are holy in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, it is not that in the morning we are holy in one matter, and then later in the day we are no longer holy in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, we need habitually to have a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what constitutes a holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would have a holy manner of life, we need to be habitually holy in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we need to become a certain kind of person, a person who is holy in constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may use fruit trees as an illustration of what we mean by a holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An apple tree produces apples according to the apple-tree manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, an orange tree produces oranges according to its manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The producing of apples by an apple tree and oranges by an orange tree is not accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, it is altogether according to the manner of life characteristic of each tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same should be true of our becoming holy in our manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some Christians who emphasize a so-called holiness may sometimes act holy, but at other times they may be very worldly or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that they do not have a holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have a holy manner of life is to have a life that is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is to have a living that is the expression of the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we were regenerated, the holy nature of the Father was imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This holy nature that is now within us is the basic factor for us to live a holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again we may use fruit trees as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If an apple tree did not have the life of an apple tree, it could not possibly have the manner of life of an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose someone tried to attach apples to the branches of another kind of tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a short period of time, the apples would fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But an apple tree, having an apple-tree manner of life, expresses the nature of the apple tree that is within it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The principle is the same with becoming holy in all our manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father has imparted His holy nature into us, and this is what makes it possible for us to have a life that expresses the holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, concerning a holy manner of life, the Holy Spirit is doing a sanctifying work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word for sanctify is the verb form of the adjective holy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Holy Spirit sanctifies us, He makes us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the Father s holy nature within us as a basis of operation, the Holy Spirit is working in us to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Third, because we are often disobedient, we need God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, Hebrews 12:10 says that God the Father disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have a holy manner of life, we need three things: the impartation of the Father s holy nature into our being, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit to make us holy, and God s discipline so that we may participate in the holiness of our holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the three factors for us to live a life of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our living should not only be holy to a certain extent, but our very manner of life should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we should have a living that is the expression of our holy God.</S>
