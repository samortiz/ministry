   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to chapter seven of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Like all the other chapters of this Gospel, this chapter is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But although it is profound, it is written in a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE YEARS OF THE LORD'S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is seen by the fact that this Gospel has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 2:13 says, "And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was the first feast of the Passover that took place during the years of the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the Lord Jesus lasted three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Passover is held in the first month of the Jewish calendar year, the month of Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Exodus 12, the Lord said to Moses concerning the month of Abib, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" v. 2 . When the children of Israel observed the Passover for the first time, the Lord commanded them to regard that month as the beginning of a new year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, that was not merely the beginning of a new year; it was the beginning of their history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to the Passover, the children of Israel were to have six other annual feasts: the feasts of unleavened bread, firstfruit, weeks Pentecost , trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the feasts which, according to the book of Leviticus, were to be held by the Jews throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John's record concerning the Lord's ministry was written according to the sequence of these feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The last of the feasts mentioned in relation to the Lord's life on earth was the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of the Passover, He was betrayed, judged, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is helpful to realize that, according to the Jewish way of reckoning time, a new day begins in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, a day is counted as beginning not in the morning, but in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was betrayed and judged during the night of His last day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in the morning, at nine o'clock, He was crucified, and He was on the cross for six hours, until three o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the Passover on which the Lord was crucified back to the Passover in chapter six of the Gospel of John is a period of one year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the last year of the Lord's life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the Passover in John 6 back to the feast of Purim in chapter five is approximately another year in the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then from the feast of Purim in chapter five back to the Passover feast in chapter two is yet another year.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before this Passover in John 2, the Lord had already been ministering for some months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason Bible students have calculated that the Lord's ministry lasted for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything from verse 13 of chapter two through chapter four of the Gospel of John took place within the period of one year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have seen, in John 5 the feast of Purim is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This feast is held in the last month of the Jewish calendar year.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John's record, there is no mention of anything that happened during the year between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the feast of the Passover in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first Passover in John is in chapter two; the second is in chapter six; and the third is in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Between the Passover in chapter two and the feast of Purim in chapter five is one year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the Passover in chapter six is another year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then between the Passover in chapter six and that in chapter twelve is yet another year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the second part of chapter one we have a preliminary record regarding the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this record we are told about John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When John saw Jesus coming to him, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John also testified and said, "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him" v. 32 . In this chapter we also read of the Lord's contact with certain ones who became His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, as we have pointed out, the preliminary record in John 1, an introduction to the entire Gospel, contains six important signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is recorded in John 1 is a prologue, an introduction, to the following chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in the first part of chapter two the Lord changed water into wine 2:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the beginning of signs and signifies life's principle changing death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the second part of chapter two a new year begins that covers chapters three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This year ends with the feast of Purim in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we have the Passover in the first month of this year, and the feast of Purim in the twelfth month of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let us now consider what happened during the first year of the Lord's ministry according to the record in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Following the sign of the changing of water into wine 2:1-11 , at the beginning of the first year of the Lord's ministry we see in 2:12-22 life's purpose building the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These verses speak of Christ's cleansing of the temple and also of the body of Jesus, the temple, being destroyed and raised up in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in chapter two we have the principle of life and the purpose of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principle of life is to change death into life, and the purpose of life is to build the house of God.</S>
