   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX FOUR PRACTICAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON REACHING UNBELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have the deep burden that if we mean business to practice the Body life, the church life, we need a balance of five matters: life, truth, gospel, service, and going out to other places for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to truly practice the church life, we need these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first four matters life, truth, gospel, and service are very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, though, we need even the last item.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some of us need to go out to other places, and the prayer and finances of those who remain must follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, our person, our heart, our prayer, and our money have to go out to reach other lands, other fields, for the Lord s kingdom and His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PRAYING FOR UNBELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we shall speak something more vital and practical concerning how to reach unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are four matters about which we should be very clear and which we must put into practice in order to reach the unbelievers in a fruitful way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first matter is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who is fruitful in reaching unbelievers must be a praying person, a person of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a general way, we may say that we already know this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, to know this is one thing, while to practice it is another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if some do practice prayer, they may not have the best secret of the practice of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we have the burden and the heart to reach unbelievers to bring them to the Lord, we must first learn how to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praying to Be Burdened for People s Souls</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to go to the Lord to ask Him to burden us with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should ask the Lord to give us the burden to reach unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that in these last days we all have a heart to realize the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do, we must pray definitely for others and especially for ourselves, saying, Lord, burden me for people s souls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the most important thing for the Lord s interests in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s house lies waste Hag 1:9 , so there is the need of the recovery of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot merely sit and talk about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For a building, there is the need of materials v. 8 . With what shall we build? If today we have twenty persons, next year we have eighteen, and the third year we have fifteen, we will eventually disband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the building we need materials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a similar way, a family needs children, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we all must pray that the Lord would burden us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Keep this matter in mind, and go to the Lord concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all must put this kind of prayer into practice, even this very day or tomorrow morning at the latest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should pray, Lord, burden me with the souls for whom You died on the cross and with whom You will build up Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that the Lord will honor this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should forget about our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am afraid that some of us have been praying too much about our own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are too self-centered, saying, Oh, I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>O Lord, I lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is always I. Forget about this poor I and consider the Lord s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Look at all the souls.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a major city there are millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever I fly over Los Angeles, I look down from the plane at the city, and I have a great burden for it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a big city it is; it takes the airplane fifteen minutes to cross it!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The metropolitan area around Los Angeles has millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a big ocean full of different kinds of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That we could not or would not catch some of them is a real shame.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day we meet many fish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must be burdened to catch some for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we must pray that the Lord would burden us for people s souls.</S>
