   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Second Twenty Minutes Word Study</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second twenty minutes can be used for word study.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many special terms like reconciliation, blood, faith, joy, peace,hope, love, obedience, righteousness, redemption, mercy, etc., which are scattered throughout the Bible, and they all are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they are grouped and compiled together, we can get a better grasp of their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, we may study the word blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we should jot down all the chapters and verses that mention the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we should analyze the meaning of each occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What has the blood done for us before God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What type of persons does the blood deal with?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What and how much has the blood accomplished for us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old and New Testament, we can find many verses which speak of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can analyze them all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This cannot be accomplished in one sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One cannot hope to see much result on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he has access to a concordance, he can save much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Third Ten Minutes Gathering Information</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One can choose specific topics and spend the next ten minutes solely gathering information concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many topics in the Bible, such as creation, man, sin, salvation, repentance, the Holy Spirit, regeneration, sanctification, justification, forgiveness, freedom, the Body of Christ, the Lord s coming, judgment, the kingdom, eternity, etc. You can choose certain topics and then gather information about them from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The most one can handle at one time is five topics; if there are more than five topics, there will be too many clues, and it will be difficult to handle them all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not gather material for one topic alone; this is too time consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One may find material for more than one topic in a chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, you may be studying about the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the particular chapter you are on may not have anything on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But you can definitely find other topics in the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a bad idea to gather information on two, three, four, or five topics at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But do not take more than five at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each topic may require some time to complete its study.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every day you have to add more material to your study.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Write down all the materials verses you have gathered, and from these write down the main words and meanings of each passage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is useless to merely jot down the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must know what the verses are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose you are studying the Holy Spirit in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In writing down sealed with the Holy Spirit in 1:13, you should also write down the meaning of the word seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, write down the verse, then the related terms, and finally the meaning of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should gather all the information this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day when you need to deal with such a topic, these materials will be on hand for you to apply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Fourth Ten Minutes Paraphrasing</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The final ten minutes can be used to paraphrase the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This exercise is very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paraphrasing the Bible gives fresh insight into a passage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By paraphrasing the Bible with simple words, we express a passage in a way that others can understand at a glance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, you may be doing a chapter-by-chapter study of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a teenager comes and says, I have read Paul s word in Romans, but I cannot understand it, you will have to think of some ways to explain this book to him using your own words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A paraphrase is not a commentary; you are merely using your own words to convey what Paul said so that those who do not understand it can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to do this, you have to learn to paraphrase the Bible with your own words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take the book of Romans and try to paraphrase it with your own words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul wrote the Epistles in his words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now you should try to write the same thing in your own words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Try your best to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do it properly and intelligently so that you can understand it and so that other brothers and sisters who read it can understand it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such paraphrasing will show how well we know the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Using our own words to reiterate the apostles thought is a good way to prepare us for biblical exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paraphrasing is the first step; exposition is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First we should learn to paraphrase the text of the Bible with our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our training before God must be in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not try to expound the Bible before learning to paraphrase it; this is too hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Learn to paraphrase the Bible first and then learn to expound it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we cannot paraphrase the Bible well, it is impossible for us to expound it well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must paraphrase first and then expound.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must all learn this basic lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First, paraphrase Paul s Epistles, then paraphrase the remainder of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In paraphrasing the Bible, try to avoid using the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Use your own words instead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The main lesson to learn here is to express the meaning of a passage with words that are within your grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After you have tried one book, you will know how precious the experience is and how profitable the exercise is.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A careless and sloppy person cannot paraphrase the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You must pray much before the Lord and read the Bible properly before you can paraphrase it correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After you finish a book, go back and revise your work once or twice, modifying it with appropriate words and polishing your sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will give you a better impression of the book, and you will come to know what the apostles were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to paraphrase a passage before you can have a deep impression of it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to paraphrase the Bible, one must first study it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He must understand what a passage says and what is implied in the passage.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He can then incorporate all his knowledge into his paraphrase.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This requires a thorough understanding of a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A person can only paraphrase the Bible when he has a clear grasp of what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Through practicing a little every day, and through careful reading and meticulous writing, one will eventually be able to paraphrase one of Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He will then be able to understand Paul s word and will be able to use other words to convey the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have mentioned four things already.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>First, study by topic; second, do a word study; third, gather information; and fourth, paraphrase.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should go through all twenty-eight methods one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A definite schedule of Bible study is an exercise for us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must gird up our loins, be restricted and regulated before the Lord, and not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we have made up our mind to study for an hour, keep this hour.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should not shorten or lengthen the time, unless we are sick or on vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Other than such exceptions, we should always keep our schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we persist in this exercise daily, we will soon reap the harvest.</S>
