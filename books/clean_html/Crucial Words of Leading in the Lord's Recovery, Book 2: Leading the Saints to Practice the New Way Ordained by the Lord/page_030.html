<h1 class="title">THE ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE SAINTS<br />
TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, from the depths of our being we shout for joy that You are the victorious Lord. You have gained the victory and will gain the victory again; eventually You will gain the full victory. Lord, we worship You that until today You are still among us and with us. Thank You that Your speaking has never departed from us and is not rare among us but increases more and more. Lord, we express our desire to You and know that our desire is just the expression of Your desire. We believe that this prayer will reach Your throne and that our desire will touch Your throne, the throne of Your authority. Lord, we look to You that You would pour down and pour out Your answer from heaven so that we might see that Your answer is swift, rich, victorious, and full of glory. Lord, we pray that You would be with Your church and remember that this is Your recovery; this is the way that You have led us to walk. Lord, strengthen us and cause us to go from strength to strength and from glory to glory so that You may receive sufficient praise and worship among us. Lord, although we work, we still have rest. Although we have heavy burdens, we still worship You from within. Lord, may You gain the glory and may all Your blessings be upon those who love You so that they may be like the sun when it rises in its might. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING<br />
A PRACTICABLE AND BLESSED WAY</h2>
<p>After listening to some fellowship that took place among the ninety-six districts of the twenty-three halls of the church in Taipei, I have much feeling and would like to share the feelings that I have written down. First, the fellowship confirms that when the training, the leading rendered by the ministry, and the practice in the churches are blended together, it is truly a glorious matter. We can see that all sides benefit. Second, I am truly comforted and encouraged because a large church such as the church in Taipei is willing to practice the new way according to the leading rendered by the ministry. Third, the new way has been proven to be a practicable and blessed way. Fourth, as long as we are willing to practice the new way according to the leading that we have received, blessing and success will come to us. Fifth, a characteristic of the new way is that it provides an opportunity for every saint to function. Formerly, the old way was closed and indirect; the new way is open and direct. The new way provides an equal opportunity to function to every newly saved one and all who love the Lord. Sixth, the new way enables many to learn and make progress in the matter of prophesying, and this progress is unlimited. Although we have seen only a beam of light, a small beginning, we deeply believe that it will reach high noon. Seventh, the new way requires us to labor more and be more diligent than before.</p>
<p>We have seen that this is the way we must take and that this way is full of blessing and rest. However, this blessing can be obtained only by our diligence, and this rest can be enjoyed only in our labor. Moreover, no matter how much help we have received in these messages, I hope that we not only remember it in our heart but also humbly receive from one another. For example, after hearing an excellent testimony from a certain church, we should study the testimony and humbly receive help from it. We should not respond to an excellent testimony by thinking that we need to find an even better way of doing the same thing. This kind of concept will not bring in blessing. Instead, those who are humble will be blessed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEGLIGENCE IN TAKING CARE<br />
OF THE SAINTS IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>Concerning dividing into districts, if the number in our big meetings reaches two hundred or even one hundred, we should divide into more districts. Dividing into districts enables us to take care of the saints. From the many testimonies we can see that our shortcoming in the past was that we were inadequate in taking care of the saints and even worse in regard to shepherding. For example, in October of 1984, before we brought up the matter of taking the new way, we estimated that the church in Taipei had at least ten thousand saints. However, in reality, at most only three thousand attended the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and a little over two thousand attended the table meeting in the evening. Of course, these numbers did not represent all the brothers and sisters who regularly attended meetings. In all, around five thousand were present in the meetings at different times. Besides these five thousand, there were perhaps more than ten thousand who stayed home without anyone taking care of them. This proves that we were truly negligent in the matter of caring for the saints.</p>
<p>In view of this, all the saints in the churches, including the elders and co-workers, who participate in home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings need to make a concerted effort to properly care for and shepherd these ten thousand saints. We particularly look to the Lord that He may lead the elders and co-workers to find a way to carry out this matter. This is an important and precious matter.</p>
<p>A brother testified that he was saved and baptized in 1949 when the church in Taipei began having gospel marches. However, he did not continue to meet with the saints. For thirty-nine years he did not attend a meeting; nevertheless, he did not forget the church. Every time he walked past Ren-ai Road and saw hall one of the church in Taipei, he would linger outside too embarrassed to enter. Not too long ago, some brothers and sisters knocked on his door. Once they entered into his house, he felt that the church had come to him. A few days prior to that visit, he had a thought within him that he desired to come back to the church but did not know how to do so. It was exactly at that time that the saints came to knock on his door and reconnect him with the church. Now he meets in hall ten. This is an excellent example that should encourage us to pick up the burden to visit those brothers and sisters who have been lost.</p>
<p>Yet another part of our family also needs care, that is, the thirty-eight thousand who were baptized through our door-knocking during the training. Among these ones, only six thousand are receiving care. Hence, there are thirty thousand who desperately need care. We cannot be sure that all of these thirty thousand are truly saved, but at least two-thirds of them are saved. According to this ratio, twenty thousand are brothers and sisters in the Lord. We need to pray for these ones and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to how to take care of these members of our family given by the Lord to the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>I hope that the church in Taipei will bear the responsibility to take care of them and bring them into the church life. Although we may not be able to gain even half of them, at least we can gain one-third and bring them into the home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings. May the church in Taipei be blessed by God to receive the burden to visit these ones consistently, beginning from today. Currently there are approximately eleven thousand who take turns to come to the meetings. We hope that this number will increase to twenty-one thousand by the end of this year. We all need to endeavor to accomplish this; the elders, in particular, should bear this burden and consider this as their goal.</p>
<p>We need to continue to practice preaching the gospel by door-knocking and visitation. This atmosphere should not be interrupted, and this flow should not stop. This matter should be gradually established as a custom among us, that is, the custom of the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel. At the same time, we should consider that door-knocking is one of many ways to preach the gospel and that it is the most effective way. This does not mean that we should not use other ways to preach the gospel. We should use any means that can bring people to salvation, but it seems that door-knocking is the most effective way. Hence, this practice should be established in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery so that it becomes the habit and custom of all the saints.</p>
<p>If the saints have the habit and custom of door-knocking, we have the assurance that with this kind of gospel preaching plus the perfecting in the home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings, that is, through the support of the homes, groups, and districts, we will be able to maintain a twofold increase every year. If from now on we go from strength to strength and continue to increase, the rate of increase will be beyond estimation. It all depends on how we labor and how we practice this way. If we do it properly and if we are all diligent, the newly saved ones will be raised up within a year to function in the same way. This can be anticipated, and it is promising and hopeful. Everything depends upon how we lead. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</p>
