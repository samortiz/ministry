   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Matthew 1 and 2 show us that the Lord is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The millennium consists of two parts: one is the kingdom of the heavens and the other, the kingdom of Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom of the heavens pertains to the Lord's relationship with the believers, which is spiritual; whereas the kingdom of Messiah pertains to the Lord's relationship with the Jews, which is physical.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Does Matthew 3:2 speak of the kingdom of the heavens as the kingdom of Messiah?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It begins by saying "Repent."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the first word spoken in relation to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it shows that the kingdom of the heavens is not physical but spiritual and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom of Messiah will rule the nations with an iron rod, and it will not be concerned with the matter of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, the kingdom of Messiah will come with power and great glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, 3:3 says, "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means to prepare the hearts of men and turn them to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 4-12: This section is a word spoken by John and, of course, is related to the drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From this portion we see the nature of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 It has nothing to do with the Jews: "Do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father" v. 9 . 2 It must be an organized entity whereby people can flee from the coming wrath v. 7 . 3 It requires holy and righteous conduct v. 8 . 4 Whoever does not have a relationship with the kingdom of the heavens will be cast into the fire v. 10 . 5 For people to be baptized is for them to believe in the One who is coming v. 11 . Hence, believing in the Lord is the initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>6 How is this Christ related to the kingdom of the heavens? a At the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens He baptizes people in the Holy Spirit, and b at the end of the kingdom of the heavens He will baptize people with fire vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a great difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of Messiah, and the proof is as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 13:11 says that the kingdom of the heavens is a mystery, which was not understood by men but is now revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 13:16-17 we see that the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens is not in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the prophets of old could not see or hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 13:35 it says, "I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The things hidden from the foundation of the world are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this we can see that before this time no one knew about the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the kingdom of Messiah was known to men such as Balaam, Isaiah, and Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When does the kingdom of the heavens begin?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From Matthew 13:24 and 30 we see that it begins with the sowing of wheat and ends with the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is this age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 16:13-19, "this rock" in verse 18 refers to Peter's confession earlier in this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 19 mentions "the keys of the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here, in the original language "keys" is plural, and they are for opening the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These keys were used to open the doors on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius to bring in the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this we can see that the church and the kingdom of the heavens begin at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The building of the church was at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The kingdom of the heavens is related to men, whereas the church is related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the Lord who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church receives position and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is our position, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Related to men</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Related to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Referring to discipline</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Referring to life-giving</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning position and grace</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to its nature, the work of John the Baptist is definitely of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The message preached by John concerning the Lord is as follows: 1 John 1:29: "the Lamb of God" and 2 Matthew 3:11: "He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One is concerned with the Lord's bearing our sins, and the other is related to the Lord's baptizing in the Holy Spirit and judging the unbelievers in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Luke 1:67-79, Zachariah's prophecies include the following: "to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins" and "to guide our feet into the way of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the message that John would preach later on.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Matthew 21:32 mentions "the way of righteousness"; this is in contrast to "the way of peace" mentioned in Luke 1:79.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John tells people to 1 repent and 2 be baptized; this is in contrast to what the Lord does, which are: 1 to bear people's sins and 2 to baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire.</S>
