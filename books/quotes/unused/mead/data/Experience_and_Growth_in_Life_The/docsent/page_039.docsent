   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 8 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:5-8 LETTING OUR REQUESTS BE MADE KNOWN TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 4:5-6 says, "Let your forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer is general with the essence of worship and fellowship; petition is special for particular needs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both our prayer and petition should be accompanied by thanksgiving to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The English preposition to in the phrase "to God" is the Greek preposition pros.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This preposition is often translated "with" John 1:1; Mark 9:19; Matt 26:55; 2 Cor 5:8; 1 Cor 16:6; 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It denotes motion towards, in the sense of a living union and communion; thus, it implies fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the meaning of "to God" here is in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1:1 uses the preposition pros in the phrase "the Word was with pros God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a word conveys the thought of traffic, something going back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It denotes motion toward some object which produces a transaction in the sense of a living union.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based upon this union, there is communion which is a communication or fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we pray, making our petition in the proper way, there should be some traffic between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Something from us should move toward God, causing God to respond to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This moving back and forth is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the proper meaning of the word fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fellowship is actually the dispensing of God for man to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fellowship we have with God, on God's side, is His dispensing, and, on our side, our receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He dispenses, and we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more fellowship we have, the more we receive of God through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are short of something, we may become anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not bear this anxiety by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should let God know, by making our requests to Him, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the kind of prayer we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to pray in the way of begging God to do things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should just tell Him what we need, that is, we should let Him know, not keeping anything within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have any worry or anxiety, we should just tell Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our letting Him know is our motion toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then His response is His dispensing, His mingling of Himself with us, even before He answers our request.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This mingling of divinity with humanity is the mingling of two entities, the divine entity and the human entity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philippians 4:6 is apparently a very simple verse since it exhorts us not to worry and to let God know our requests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the reality this word reveals is not so simple or shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Electricity also is apparently very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you need heat or light you just push a button, and you get heat or light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you want cold air, you just push another button.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The application of electricity is very simple, but the science of electricity is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If electricity were dispensed into you without limit, you would die of its electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The higher the current of electricity is, the quicker you would die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But with the "divine electricity," the divine dispensing, the more God you receive, the more you live.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, as you receive this divine electricity, the old man dies, but on the other hand, the new man lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The divine dispensing is also a science, and the study of the divine dispensing can never be exhausted.</S>
