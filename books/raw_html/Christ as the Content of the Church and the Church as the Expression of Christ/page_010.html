<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Glory</h2><p>Eventually, our natural man—including the will, the self, the flesh, the “I”—must be broken. The “I” has to be broken, riven, torn down. Then we will get into the spirit. When we are walking in the spirit and not in our natural life, we will enjoy Christ as the glory of God in the Holy of Holies. We will have Christ expressed among us and through us as the glory of God. This is the expression of Christ to the uttermost. We should not only have Christ as righteousness in our behavior and holiness in our lives. We should also have Him as our glory. Then the natural life, the self, the flesh, the “I,” has been put away and we are in the spirit, the Holy of Holies. When we are in the spirit, we can sense that we have Christ as the glory expressed among us.<p>In the outer court we see the white linen, and in the Holy Place we see the gold. The most significant thing in the Holy of Holies is the glory. Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory is the very content of the church life, and the church is the expression of such a Christ. In these days we expect that such a local expression of Christ will be raised up in many places. This is God’s intention, and this is what His enemy is trying to frustrate.<p>We can never be built together in ourselves. The acacia wood of the standing boards of the tabernacle signifies our regenerated, resurrected, uplifted, and reinforced human nature, not our natural human nature. In our untransformed human nature, we cannot be built up. The stronger we become in our natural man, the more independent we are. The weaker we become, the more we become limited and dependent on others. We have to be overlaid with gold. When we enjoy Christ more and more, the increasing measure of Christ unites us with others in God’s building. In ourselves we are too independent and can never stand with others. But when we enjoy Christ, we are being overlaid with Him, and the Christ whom we enjoy unites us. The more we enjoy Christ, the more unity we will have.<h2 class=head1>EATING CHRIST AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD</h2><p>We need to stress the matter of eating Christ. At the altar in the outer court, there was the eating of the offerings. At the showbread table in the Holy Place, there was the eating of the showbread. Also, in the Holy of Holies within the ark was the golden pot with the hidden manna (Heb. 9:4). This signifies the Christ eaten, digested, and assimilated by us. We have to put Christ on as our righteousness. But we also have to eat of Him to enjoy Him. We feast on Him at the altar in the outer court and at the showbread table in the Holy Place. We also enjoy Him as our inward, hidden supply in the ark in the Holy of Holies. We enjoy Christ subjectively by feasting on Him. We all have to learn to feast on Christ day by day. When we feast on Him, He will sanctify us, transform us, and conform us to His image. Then there can be the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God.<p>The content of the church is Christ Himself as righteousness, holiness, and glory, and the church is the expression of such a Christ. When there is such an expression in our locality, both we and the Lord will be satisfied to the uttermost. If we have such a church life, we will be satisfied. Our being satisfied means that the Lord is satisfied. This must be our goal. We must go on by His grace to attain this goal. In all of the localities we must build up such a glorious expression of Christ. This is the ultimate recovery of the Lord.
