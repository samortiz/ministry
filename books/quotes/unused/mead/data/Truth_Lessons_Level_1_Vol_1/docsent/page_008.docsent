   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible reveals that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a revelation of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is uniquely one, and His name is Jehovah; yet this God is also triune He is the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a mystery; in fact, it is a mystery of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Small and finite as we are, we human beings cannot understand it thoroughly; even less can we define it in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many things relating to the matter of life are not within the comprehension of men; men can only have a general idea of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, though we have life in our physical body, no one can explain it thoroughly, for life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, there is a spirit within us this is even more of a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one can give a full explanation of what the life of man and the spirit of man are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not able to comprehend such a comparatively small mystery as man, to say nothing of the great mystery of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we cannot fully understand man, how much less the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot understand, but we can enjoy!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In former days men had no knowledge of vitamins, though they greatly enjoyed their benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God is not for us to understand, but to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All that He is for us to enjoy is revealed in the Scriptures; we cannot fully understand it, yet we may, according to all that is declared in the Scriptures, accept whatever is said.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we cannot find the term triune in the Scriptures, we can see the fact concerning the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us now examine the verses in the Bible that are more evidently related to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. GOD BEING ONLY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Scriptures in many instances and in many ways tell us that God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New, there are many passages which clearly and definitely tell us that God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 8:4 says, There is no God but one, and Isaiah 45:5 says, I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similar words also can be found in Isaiah 45:6, 21, 22; and 44:6, 9.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these passages God repeatedly says, There is no God besides me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not say, There is no God besides us, but, There is no God besides me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Me is singular, only one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These repeated declarations of God strongly prove that God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 86:10 says, Thou art God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here it does not say, Ye are God alone, but, Thou art God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also proves that God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That God is one is a clear and definite revelation of the Scriptures; it is also a fundamental and consummate principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps some will ask, Since God is only one, why did God speak of Himself as Us in Genesis 1:26?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And why did He say Our image?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is there just one God, or is there more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The answer is: He is the Triune God; He is one, yet three the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD HAVING THE ASPECT OF THREE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT A. God Speaking as I and Also as Us</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Isaiah 6:8 God says, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God speaks of Himself on one hand as I and on the other hand as Us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that I is Us and Us is I; I and Us are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, is God singular or plural?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you say He is plural, He says I. If you say He is singular, He says Us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is rather mysterious and difficult to understand; so we simply take the scriptural revelation as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, Genesis 1:26 says, And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That the only God, in His divine word, speaks of Himself a number of times as Us is truly a mystery which is hard for us to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, we must believe that it is because of God being the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. The Matter of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord here clearly speaks of Three the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that though the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three, yet the name is one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is really mysterious one name for Three.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This, of course, is what is meant by the expression three-one, or triune.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, as spoken by the Lord here, the name Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All we can say is that the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This name includes the Three Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and tells us that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although God is only one, yet there is the matter of the Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
