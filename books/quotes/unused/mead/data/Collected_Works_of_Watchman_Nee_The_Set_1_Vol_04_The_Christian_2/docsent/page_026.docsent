   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Nineteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord continued in verse 19: "Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Therefore."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the Lord Jesus is "the First and the Last and the living One," and because He "became dead," and is "living forever and ever," and because He has "the keys of death and of Hades," therefore "write."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to show forth His glory, and because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to declare the believer's responsibility and the devil's defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since He was alive from the dead and is the Lord of all, He commanded John to write, and His commandment must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Write" is mainly for securing a written testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not want this message to be passed on orally because oral rendition could change His words with additions and subtractions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation is the last book that He inspired in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not want to see that His New Testament would lack a book of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told the apostle John to write it down to complete all of His records on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse speaks of the three sections of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What the apostle John wrote was a book of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is described in the book are the things that John has seen, the things that are, and the things that shall be hereafter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The things which have been seen Past .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The things which are Present .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The things which are about to take place after these things Future .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are the three sections of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I."Have seen."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word is in the perfect tense in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It means to have already seen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord told John in the next verse v. 20 , "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands." The things which had been seen are the seven stars and seven lampstands in John's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here, John had already seen the seven stars and seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the previous few verses he said how he had seen them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the first section chapter one has been covered already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now what is left are the other two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II."The things which are."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means the things that are now existing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This covers the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A literal translation of verse 20 could be: "The seven stars are now the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are now the seven churches."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The things which are" are the things of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beginning with chapter four, everything concerns the things of "the day of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no doubt that we are now in the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The things starting with chapter four are not yet fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, chapters two and three relate to the things of the present, or the things that are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>III."The things which are about to take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapter four, verse 1 says: "And I will show you the things that must take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this verse we realize that "the things which are about to take place" start with chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the third section of "the things which are about to take place" starts with chapter four, and since the first section is identified with chapter one, it is obvious that the second section must be chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word "after" is meaningful here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It indicates that the third section starts only after the first and second sections have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The third section does not occur concurrently with the first or second section.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Chapter three, verse 16 tells us that Christ will spew the church out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He detests the church as His testimony!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, it is meaningless for anyone to make chapters four through nineteen to be the church's history.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The things of the third section will not start until God has given up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first words of chapter four say "after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This proves that the things which are about to take place in the third section come after the current things of chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before the things of the churches in chapters two and three have come to pass, the things that are about to take place in chapter four will surely not begin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can be in the third section only if this is now no longer the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as these past nineteen hundred years belong to the age of the church, the third section cannot begin because the second section has not ended.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Beginning from chapter four, the church age ends.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The stars and lampstands that John saw before no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Holy Place, which was closed in the past, now opens its door wide to reveal God's throne of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus was a priest, but now He is the Offering and the King of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The period of grace is over and the day of vengeance is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The four Gospels and the Acts signify a transitional period from the Jews to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Revelation signifies the period of transition from the Gentiles to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It also touches upon the things of the kingdom and eternity.</S>
