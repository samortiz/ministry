[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE ECONOMY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; Heb 2:14; Gen 12:3b; Gal 3:8; Isa 12:3; Mark 16:15; 1 Tim 2:4; Num 6:24-27; Exo 20:12; Deut 28:3-6; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 6:2-3; 1 Cor 3:21-22; 3 John 2; Eph 1:9-11; 3:9-11; Rev 4:11; Gen 1:26-27; John 1:14, 18; Eph 2:21-22; 3:17-19; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rev 21:1 22:5
[4]  Prayer: Lord, every time we gather together, we are full of thanksgiving, praise, and worship.
[5]  The present age is a dark and corrupted age, but You have saved us and have rescued us from all the preoccupations and ensnaring things and have gathered us into Your name.
[6]  The third layer of the divine revelation in the Bible is the economy and dispensing of God.
[7]  In Ephesians 1:9-11 and 3:9-11, God's economy is mentioned.
[8]  In the Old Testament we see that God created all things.
[9]  Genesis 1:26-27 tells us that God created man in His image that man may express Him and represent Him.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE DISPENSING OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:9; John 1:14, 29; 3:14; 12:31, 24; 1 Cor 15:45, 44; Rom 8:16, 11; John 3:5-6; Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:17, 23; Phil 3:21; 1 John 3:2; Rom 8:2, 10, 6b, 13, 4
[11]  We look to You as the wonderful One to open up Your mysterious word to us.
[12]  May we learn to experience You and Your dispensing, and may we experience all the riches that are in this dispensing, so that these riches can become our element within and our expression without.
[13]  Here we need to see God's economy and dispensing.
[14]  For this reason, in the Old Testament God created man according to His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26 so that He might put Himself into man and be man's life, that man might become one with Him and express and represent Him.
[15]  God's economy, that is, His plan and arrangement, is God's goal Eph 1:10; 3:9 .
[16]  God's dispensing, that is, His apportioning and distributing, is His means.
[17]  In order to accomplish the economy of working Himself into man, God has to pass through the means of dispensing.
[18]  As the life-giving Spirit, Christ first regenerated our spirit John 3:5-6 so that, in addition to our natural life, we might receive the eternal life of God as the new source and the new element of the new man.
[19]  After this, Christ as the life-giving Spirit spreads out from our spirit to transform our soul.
[20]  If we set our mind, the main part of our soul, on the spirit and cooperate with the operation and work of the Lord Spirit within us, our mind will be renewed Rom 12:2 .
[21]  IN THEIR GROWTH IN LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 2:19; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 6:57b; 1 Cor 10:3-4; 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 5:12-14; John 6:31-35, 48-51, 63; Eph 6:17-18a; Psa 55:17; 119:147-148; 143:8; Lam 3:22-26; Eph 5:13-14; Rom 8:13
[22]  Although God loves us and chose and predestinated us to be the objects of His grace, we became fallen soon after we were created.
[23]  Because of this we needed redemption, which was accomplished for us by God in Christ through His blood v. 7 .
[24]  Actually, the sealing of the Holy Spirit is the divine dispensing.
[25]  Almost the entire Bible speaks of eating, drinking, and enjoying God.
[26]  After God created man, He did not give many commandments and regulations for man to keep.
[27]  Every living creature needs to grow and to mature.
[28]  An inorganic object does not have life; hence, it does not need to grow.
[29]  We have seen that God has an economy, which is to have the Divine Trinity worked into us that we, the chosen ones who have His life, may become His corporate expression.
[30]  We have also seen that in order to accomplish this eternal economy, the Triune God must go through a procedure, which is to dispense the Divine Trinity step by step into us that He might become our life and that we might become His living, that God and man may be mingled and joined as one.
[31]  When God dispenses Himself into us and His element is daily added into us, we the believers grow in life.
[32]  After I was saved, I began to love to read the Bible.
[33]  I desired very much to know the Bible and wanted to know what the Bible was all about.
[34]  Although I was still a poor student, I tried my best to secure spiritual books and books on Bible exposition.
[35]  Some may ask, does not the Bible also teach man to have all kinds of virtues?
[36]  How can we say that God does not want us to do good?
[37]  By ourselves we can never live out all the virtues of Christ.
[38]  In our daily living we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .
[39]  In order to save fallen man, God became flesh and became a man in the Son and through the Spirit.
[40]  Such a Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God as He was before the Lord became flesh, but is the Spirit of God after the Lord's resurrection, being produced as a mingling of the Holy Spirit, who has divinity, with the Lord's incarnation His humanity , His human living under the cross, His crucifixion, and His resurrection.
[41]  The supply and dispensing of His life cause us to be saved in our living of Christ, so that we may not be put to shame because we have not lived Christ, and may not lose the testimony that we ought to bear for Christ because of our failure to magnify Christ.
[42]  If we want to receive and to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, first we must love the Lord with all our hearts.
[43]  IN THEIR GOSPEL AND WORK Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16-17, 29; 12:31; Heb 2:14; John 12:24; 19:34; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; 1 John 2:20, 27; Phil 1:19; John 3:5-6; 15:1, 5; 4:10, 14; 6:49-51, 63; 7:38-39; 15:4-5, 16; 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2; John 15:7; 6:27, 57-58; Exo 16:13b-15, 21; Eph 6:17-18a
[44]  In the previous chapters we have seen that God's economy is to dispense Himself as the unlimited and untraceable supply to the believers for their growth in life and for their living.
[45]  After His incarnation, Christ lived on this earth for more than thirty years.
[46]  Then He went to the cross and was crucified there.
[47]  Chapter one of the Gospel of John tells us that Christ was God in eternity past v. 1 . This very God who was the Word became incarnated to be a man v. 14 . Then, chapter twenty tells us that after His death, this Christ entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He changed His form and became a life-giving Spirit vv.
[48]  In painting, one layer of paint is painted upon another until the painted article is covered with all the elements of the paint.
[49]  This is the dispensing of the paint into the painted article.
[50]  Today, the Triune God as a compound Spirit is painting Himself into us.
[51]  In feeding the lambs, we dispense further the riches of the divine life to the new believers for their growth in life John 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2 .
[52]  In the Gospel of John we are charged to do two things: in chapter fifteen we are charged to bear remaining fruit v. 16 , and in chapter twenty-one we are charged to feed the lambs, the new believers v. 15 . Both the bearing of fruit and the feeding of lambs are a dispensing of life into others.
[53]  The way to carry out the gospel work and the feeding work is to dispense the life of Christ into the unbelievers and the believers.
[54]  Third, we need to drink of Christ as the living water John 4:10, 14 .
[55]  This water is the water of the eternal life, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.
[56]  In the previous chapter we saw from the Gospel of John God's dispensing as the supply to the believers in their preaching of the gospel and in their work for the Lord.
[57]  It tells us that God wants us not only to have life, but also, after receiving life, to be supplied by this life day by day and hour by hour.
[58]  First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is "theirs and ours."
[59]  First Corinthians 11 says that Christ is the Head of every man v. 3a . Here Christ's being the Head of every man refers to Christ's being the Head of the members of His Body.
[60]  We have seen from 1 Corinthians 1 15 that the Christ into whom we have been called is an all-inclusive One.
[61]  First Corinthians 12 unveils to us the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit.
[62]  After this, Paul shows us in chapter thirteen that love is the most excellent way to exercise the gifts.
[63]  If we pay attention only to the outward gifts and do not have love, the gifts will be empty and without life.
[64]  But if we have love, and we add to it faith and hope, we have something that abides.
[65]  To practice the new way today is to apply this life-dispensing of Christ practically to our meetings and service.
[66]  For this we must perfect the saints through the group meetings Heb 10:24-25 so that all the saints will be the same as we are, enjoying the life dispensing of Christ to become members who are the supplying joints in the Body of Christ for the perfecting of the other members Eph 4:16, 11-12a that every member in the Body of Christ may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12b .
[67]  Many people are familiar with John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."
[68]  In this verse three things are taking place: first, God gave, and is still giving; second, we believe; and third, we shall have eternal life.
[69]  In these three points we can see God's dispensing.
[70]  God's dispensing is to dispense the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into us.
[71]  God the Spirit is the One whom the Son has given to us.
[72]  When God is given to us, He becomes the Spirit in us.
[73]  As the totality of the Triune God, this Spirit is dwelling in us as the life-giving Spirit.
[74]  That They May Be Mingled with the Triune God
[75]  This is why we Christians are very different from all the people of the world: we have the Triune God within us.
[76]  In God the Father's Life and Nature as Gold,
[77]  We will also see the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Christ's making His home in the believers' hearts that they would be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[78]  In the eyes of God, we the believers are considered to be one new man.
[79]  As the Body of Christ, our function is to express Christ, and as the new man, our function is to move, work, act, and do things to accomplish God's great plan.
[80]  This new man is a corporate and vast man, comprising all God's chosen people.
[81]  In Greek the word for masterpiece is poema, which means a poem.
[82]  In this oneness there is the mingling of the Spirit with the Body of Christ.
[83]  Ephesians 4:5 says, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism."
[84]  This verse shows us the Son's mingling with His Body in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[85]  In Ephesians 4 we have first the Spirit's dispensing in verse 4; then we have the Son's dispensing in verse 5; and finally we have the Father's dispensing in verse 6.
[86]  Today many Christian workers talk about the building up of the church.
[87]  Some say that Christ is the One who directly builds up the church.
[88]  The way Christ builds up the church is by the giving, or dispensing, of the divine grace according to the measures of the gifts of Christ, who are the persons constituted with Christ's life and element through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity v. 7 . Each gifted person has a measure, and the divine grace is given, or dispensed, to him according to that measure.
[89]  Building of the Organic Body of Christ Holding to Truth in Love, Growing Up into
[90]  The perfecting by the gifted persons is for the direct building of the organic Body of Christ by the members of the Body.
[91]  In order to be built up, first we must grow into the Head, Christ, in all things v. 15 . Although some of us may love the Lord very much, we may still hold on to many things that the Lord does not want.
[92]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS' LIVING FOR THE BUILDING UP
[93]  The life of God is for the supplying of His children with His riches in His divine dispensing.
[94]  OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST The Basic Principles
[95]  In order to live such a life, there are a number of principles and details that we need to pay attention to.
[96]  as the Truth Reality versus Vanity Is in Jesus
[97]  The fourth principle is that we need to learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus Eph 4:20-21 .
[98]  Now we come to the details of the believers' living.
[99]  The first point is that as members of the Body, we need to speak truth one with another v. 25 . We should never lie to our fellow members.
