If we go back to Romans 7, we shall find two other laws, the law of good in the mind (v. 23) and the law of God (v. 25). Both the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and of death are mysterious.<h2 class=head1>TWO MEANINGS OF LAW</h2><p>To begin with, we know that the word law means not only commandments but also set-up principles. Gravity is a law, for example. So is the digestion of food. These are both laws of nature; they are not commandments. Paul uses the word law in both senses. When he speaks of the law of God in Romans 7:25, he is referring to Mosaic law, the Ten Commandments and all the ordinances. Exodus 20 gives us the Ten Commandments; the next three chapters list the ordinances. The ordinances are like small commandments; they with the Ten Commandments, which are the principles of God&#8217;s law, comprise what is called the law, not the law of nature, but the law of commandments.<p>The two laws in Romans 8:2 are not commandments but principles. These laws operate by nature. If we are human beings, born of parents of flesh and blood, certain laws operate within us, not by activities but by set-up principles. Paul referred to one of these laws in Romans 7:21: &#8220;I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.&#8221; This law in our members is not a commandment but a principle. It is a law not of good but of evil.<p>While we are still very young, even before we start school, we spontaneously lie. No one commanded us to lie, but when the occasion arose, that is what we did. No one taught us to steal, but we helped ourselves to some candy. Then, when our mother asked if we had taken any, we quickly answered no. Was there a commandment, telling us to say no to our mother? We had no commandment; we were acting according to the law of evil within us. When we throw something into the air, we do not need to command it to come down; by itself it responds to the law of gravity and comes down. This is the way the law operates.<p>As those born of flesh and blood, we have the law of sin and of death operating in us. The blood is circulating in our body; even before my sentence is finished, the blood has already circulated a few times. Who commanded the blood to circulate? No one. The blood circulates according to a law of nature. So it is with the law of sin and of death.<p>But there is another law, a superior law! We have had a second birth. By the first birth we have the law of sin and of death. With the second birth we have the law of the Spirit of life. What a wonderful name this law has! It is not the law of good. It is not the law of ethics. It is not the law of morality. This law is the law of the Spirit of life.<p>What is meant by Spirit? What is meant by life? Both are mysteries. Spirit no doubt refers to the Spirit of God. Life must refer to the divine life.<h2 class=head1>LIFE AS A LAW</h2><p>Every kind of life is not only governed by a law; every life is a law. The apple life is a law; the peach life is also a law. There is no need to command the peach tree to produce peaches. There is no need to explain to it how the peaches should look. If you do, the peach tree will reply, &#8220;Who are you? How can you be so foolish? I don&#8217;t need to be told to produce peaches. I have a peach law within me. I don&#8217;t need commandments. All I need is for you to allow me to live and grow. Water me. Give me the proper fertilizer. Then I&#8217;ll produce the peaches you want. I cannot bring forth peaches by making up my mind to do what my master has commanded me! I do not produce by activities; I bring forth peaches according to the law within me.&#8221;<p>When I was young, I saw an interesting scene of a cat catching a mouse. The mouse was running around very actively. When it suddenly saw the cat, it did not know what to do. The cat of course was happy to catch the mouse. Before finishing it off, he played with it for quite a while. He jumped around it and looked at it from different angles. Then he threw it into the air. He really enjoyed his &#8220;toy.&#8221; This scene illustrates the law which governs the cat and the law which governs the mouse. All life, whether animal, plant, or human, has a corresponding law. In fact, as we have said, every life is a law.<p>More than this, every living thing or person has a law because it or he is living. Actually, every living thing or person is a law. We are regulated by ourselves as a law. Why do we breathe? Who commanded us to breathe? Suppose we command a table to start breathing. It could not because it does not have the ability of life to breathe. We, on the other hand, right from the day of our birth, have been breathing without anyone&#8217;s commanding us to do so. This, and many other things, we do by law, not by activities, because of the life we have. As living persons, our life is a law.<h2 class=head1>THREE LIVES WITHIN THE BELIEVER</h2><p>Christians are complicated persons. A Christian has three lives! When Adam was in the garden of Eden before the fall, he had only one life, the human created life. After the fall another life entered into him, the satanic life. From then on, man began to behave in two ways. Sometimes he acted as a man, but other times as a devil. You may leave for work in the morning as a man and come back home at the end of the day a devil. Even within a minute you may change from one to the other. This is the result of having two lives within you.<p>Since every life has and even is a law, with these two lives there are two laws. In Romans 7 Paul describes these two laws. He tells us that in his mind he wanted to do the good (vv. 15-24). The man created by God was good, moral, ethical. Love, humility, kindness, and all the other virtues were created by God. That is why man is ethical. However, when he fell, another life entered into him. This satanic life brought with it another law, the law which is called &#8220;the evil.&#8221; It is the law of sin, bringing in death; thus, in Romans 8:2 it is called the law of sin and of death. These two laws, the law of good and the law of sin and of death, are present in fallen man.<p>At the time of our salvation, we received a third life, the divine life. Now, though we are only one person, we have three lives. We have the good human life, the evil satanic life, and the spiritual divine life. With them we have the corresponding laws. How complicated we are!<p>Even when we are young, we often have the intention to do good. We want to love our parents and be kind to our brothers and sisters. This is the human law. However, it is not up to us. &#8220;To will is present with me, but to do the good is not&#8221; (7:18). How things turn out is up to another law. &#8220;For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice&#8221; (7:19). Paul concludes that if he does what he does not will, it is no longer he that does it but sin that dwells in him (v. 20). This indwelling sin acts contrary to our will. This is a law.<p>The third life, the divine life, is the strongest. Thus its law is also the strongest. It is the law of the Spirit of life. Spirit here refers to God&#8217;s Spirit and life to His divine life. We have a law operating in us which is the strongest in the whole universe! This law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death (Rom. 8:2).<p>These two laws, the law of sin and of death and the law of the Spirit of life, are operating within us. Their work is according to law, not activity. The digestive processes work by law, not by activity, whenever we eat. Similarly, for a fallen person to sin is not merely by activities, but by law. To sin is a matter of law. To be freed from sin is also by law, by a stronger law.<h2 class=head1>GOD, MAN, AND SATAN</h2><p>There are many different beings in the universe, but only three are vital. The first is God. The second is man. The third is Satan.<p>The Bible, it is often said, is a revelation of God. Surely this is true. But the Bible also reveals man. Without the Bible we do not know what man is. We may have read the great philosophers&#8217; writings, but if we do not know the Bible, we still do not know what man is. We do not know where we came from nor where we are going; we do not know where we are; we do not know what human life is; and we do not know the purpose of human life.<p>Philosophy does not have these answers. I have read the writings of some of the Chinese philosophers; to me they are foolish, not wise. Plato and Socrates are also philosophically foolish. Confucius, for example, said that if a man sins against heaven (that is, God), he has no way to be forgiven. Is this not foolish? The Bible strongly tells us that our sins may be forgiven.<p>If we want to know ourselves, we can find our biography in the Bible. Here we learn where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. These things we need to know so that we may fulfill our role in the universe.<p>Satan is the third vital figure in the universe. There are other secondary characters, like angels; but God, man, and Satan are the primary ones.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION</h2><p>Over the years you may have heard a good many messages in the recovery. I wonder, however, if you young people realize what God&#8217;s eternal intention is for you. Christians, even though they are God&#8217;s saved and regenerated children, are for the most part unaware of what God&#8217;s intention is for them. You may be very familiar with the Bible yet still miss its central point. You may have heard what it is and thought that you saw it, but still you may not really have grasped it. Since I came to the United States, I might have given about three thousand messages along this line. I repeat it from different angles over and over again. Yet it bothers me that I see so few living daily according to this eternal intention.<p>God&#8217;s eternal intention is to enter into you and become your life. He wants to make you one with Him that you may live Him. Eventually He becomes your life, and you become His living. You may say that you already know this. You may think it is simple. It is simple, but not practical to you. It does not apply to your daily living.<p>Man was made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26). What image and likeness mean we shall not consider now. However, notice that it is said only of man. All the other created things were to bring forth after their kind (Gen. 1:11, 12, 21, 24, 25). The cat is after the cats&#8217; kind; an apple is after the apples&#8217; kind. After what kind is man? Man does not have his own kind. Man is after the kind of God! He bears the image of God. We were not made in the image of a turtle, or a monkey, or a donkey. Even though we are fallen, we are nonetheless a man, bearing the image of God.<p>What is the image of God? The New Testament tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). When He came and dwelt among men, He expressed love, kindness, mercy, grace, and light. For man to be created in the likeness of God means that he was created in the form of God&#8217;s virtues. The loving God created love in man. The merciful God created mercy in man. Man thus possesses mercy and love; he has all the virtues God has.<h2 class=head1>THE GLOVE AND THE HAND</h2><p>Man&#8217;s love, however, is not the real love. Human love is like a glove. A glove has the likeness of a hand. Why is a glove made in this form? It is so that a real hand may get into it. The glove is intended to be the container of the hand. Human love is only the container for the divine love. This is true of all the human virtues. When there are gloves without hands, the gloves are empty. The gloves are not made for themselves; they are made for the hands. Human virtues are gloves; the divine virtues are the hand.<p>We need love, but our love is merely a container. The real love as the contents is the divine love. If we love someone by our own love, without having God&#8217;s love in it, our love is empty. In the teachings of Confucius the goal is to develop the created human virtues. When I used to preach the gospel in China, I would tell my hearers that they had only the glove without the hand. Now I was presenting the hand to them. Who was the hand? Christ! Confucius, for example, taught submission; a woman was to submit herself first to her father, then to her husband, and then to her son. This submission, I said, is a glove. Sometimes we may be able to succeed in it, but such submission is empty and false. We appear to submit, but actually we are gritting our teeth. Now I offer you the hand to fill your empty glove. Christ is the real submission!<p>I do not mean that Christians should have no regard for morality. Our behavior should be of the highest moral standard. We have not only the glove but also the hand! Our morality is higher and more practical. When Jesus Christ was living on this earth, His ethics were the highest. Whose ethics can exceed those of Jesus? These are the ethics we are living today. We have not only the glove, but the hand in the glove! Surely the ethics or morality in the local churches exceed the common practice.<h2 class=head1>REPENTING OF THE GOOD</h2><p>In our daily life, however, all too often we do not have this realization of the distinction between the hand and the glove. Many times these past few years I have had to make confession, not of my failures or my hatred, but of my love or my kindness. Many times I have loved without the love of Christ. I have loved as an elderly, experienced man. It is no longer easy for me to be irritated. When I was young and inexperienced, my temper could easily flare up. Now that I am close to eighty, the fire is quenched. I am not easily provoked. It is easy for me to be good. How I have come to hate my goodness! I have had to confess to the Lord, &#8220;Today from morning till evening I have been good to everyone without You. Forgive me. I have given message after message to the saints, charging them to live You, yet I myself have been a failure nearly the entire day. I have not lived You. I have lived myself. I have lived an elderly, experienced man. Forgive me, Lord Jesus.&#8221;<p>My younger brother has been here for many months now. He himself will agree that whenever he has come to see me, I have always treated him in a kindly way. Nonetheless, I have had to tell the Lord that I did not live Christ to my brother. Since he came, I believe he has not gained much Christ through me; I have ministered very little Christ to him. I have treated him well and done many kind things for him. Yet I have repented to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. May Your blood cleanse me that I have not lived You to my brother.&#8221;<p>In your daily realization you have no sense of how naturally good you are. If you tell a lie to a brother, your conscience will immediately prick you. How could you have lied to a brother? You may never have lied to a brother; you have done only good to him. Have you ever repented of the good you have done to a brother? If you receive the mercy to repent of doing good to others, you are very much graced by the Lord.<h2 class=head1>BORN OF GOD</h2><p>It would be helpful to pray-read the verses listed at the beginning of the message. John 1:12-13 tells us that we have been born of God. If we are born of someone, we surely have that one&#8217;s life and nature. Since we have been born of God, surely we have His life and nature. This is not to say that we are objects of worship. We are not the Godhead; only the Godhead is to be worshipped. We are the children of God, and we are like Him because we have His life and nature. God has been born into us. How marvelous this is!<h2 class=head1>MINGLED WITH GOD</h2><p>John 14 tells us that the Spirit of reality is coming, not only to be with us but to be in us (vv. 16-17). In that day, that is, the day of resurrection, &#8220;you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20). Here is mingling. We are in Christ, and He is in us. This is not the realm of ethics or morality. Verse 23 has the same thought: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; To have the Father and the Son in us is not a doctrinal matter. It must be our daily realization and practice.<h2 class=head1>ABIDING IN HIM</h2><p>The next chapter (John 15) says that we are to abide in Him and He in us, &#8220;for apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (vv. 4-5). That we can abide in Christ and have Him abide in us indicates that we and He, the very God, are one. This is God&#8217;s eternal intention. In all we do we must check to see that we are abiding in Him. It is not simply a remembering of the fact. We must keep asking ourselves whether what we are doing at any given time is being done by our abiding in Him. If it is being done apart from Him, we must condemn it. In the eyes of the world what we are doing may be good, but if it is done apart from Christ, it is to be condemned. It is good for a wife to submit to her husband; but her submission must be by Christ&#8217;s abiding in her and her abiding in Him. Her submission, in other words, must be Christ. It must be the expression of Him.<p>If we see this, we shall confess, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. In this whole day I have spent very little time to live You. I have not done wrong. I have been careful to do what is right and what is helpful to others. But my living has not been by abiding in You and having You abide in me.&#8221; To see this is to see the central vision of the Apostle Paul&#8217;s completing ministry. His completing word is the mystery of God, which is Christ in you (Col. 1:25-27). Our life must be filled and saturated with Christ. Our living must be Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT INDWELLING US</h2><p>Romans 8:9-11 tells us that the Spirit dwells in us. &#8220;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM</h2><p>First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; First Romans tells us that the Spirit dwells in us. Then this verse tells us that we are one spirit with the Lord. Do we live a life that is one spirit with Him? Many times we must confess that we do not. To live one spirit with Him is far higher than to live ethically, to love others, or to be humble. It is Christ Himself lived out of us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2><p>&#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (Eph. 3:17, 19). For Christ to make His home in our hearts that we might be filled unto all the fullness of God is other than devotion, piety, religion. It is not even spirituality. It is God, the Triune God, making home in our hearts and filling us. This &#8220;one God and Father of all...is over all and through all and in all&#8221; (Eph. 4:6). He is not only above us and through us but also in us.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US</h2><p>&#8220;Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit&#8221; (1 John 4:13). There is Someone dwelling in us besides ourselves. It is the Spirit. The Spirit is the consummate manifestation of the Triune God. Hallelujah, the Triune God is in us!<h2 class=head1>SATAN</h2><p>&#8220;In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil&#8221; (1 John 3:10). Many Christians have been taught that Christ is seated on the throne at the right hand of God; He does not live in them, but He has sent His Representative to be in them. They do not believe that Christ Himself dwells in us. No doubt they also do not believe that Satan is in their nature. Notice that this verse calls some the children of the Devil. Are they his adopted children? Did he simply find them on the street, take pity on them, and adopt them for his own? To be called the children of the Devil means that such were born of Satan; his life and nature are in them. John 8:44 says, &#8220;You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father.&#8221; The Jews might claim to have Abraham for their father, but their real father was the Devil, the father of liars. They were born of him.<p>Ephesians 2:2 tells us that the ruler of the authority of the air &#8220;now is operating in the sons of disobedience.&#8221; Where is Satan today? He is not only in the air, but also in fallen man, in our flesh. This was his counterplot.<p>Matthew 16:22-23 records that one day Peter was being kind and loving toward the Lord Jesus, telling Him, &#8220;God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!&#8221; He was unaware that Satan was in him and that he was one with Satan. The Lord turned to him, calling him not Peter but Satan. Not only was the betraying Judas a devil (John 6:70); even the loving Peter became Satan.<p>These verses are enough to impress us that both Satan and God have wrought themselves into our being. Satan is in our flesh. God is in our spirit. In the next message we shall see that Satan in our flesh is the law of sin and of death. This God who has been processed and is now the Spirit dwelling in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life. Both Satan and God are now within us as laws.<p>You may find this hard to believe. It no doubt differs from what you were taught in the past. I beg you to drop your religious background and consider the pure Word of God. If you reject what I have just shared with you, where do you put all these verses? The ruler of the authority of the air as the evil spirit is now operating in fallen man; before you were saved, Satan was working in this way in you (Eph. 2:2). Even after you are saved, Satan is still present. This is clear from the example of Peter. He was saved in Matthew 16:16. After that he nonetheless became Satan.<p>Praise the Lord that we have the highest law in our spirit, which has freed us from the evil law!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TWO TREES IN GENESIS AND THE TWO LAWS IN ROMANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:8-9, 16-17; Rom. 7:21-25a; 8:1-2</h1><p>There are many things on this globe which people treasure. I would like to tell them, however, to throw those things away. I have diamonds to give them! This is the gospel. The gospel imparts to us something other than what we have. It offers us God Himself.<p>The Jews believe that they have God, but actually they do not. God is in Christ. God in Christ is the treasure. Without Christ we do not know where God is; He cannot be traced. I would like to tell my Jewish friends that what they have is not real. What I would share with them is real. This sounds proud, but it is not. It is spoken out of love. I may have come from a nation despised by the western people, but nonetheless I do have something beyond what they have.<h2 class=head1>WHY THE LORD CHOSE CHINA</h2><p>In a private talk with me in 1933, Brother Nee spoke with me about the Lord&#8217;s move. After Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren, he said, the Lord unquestionably raised up the Brethren in the 1820s under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. These British Brethren were much used by the Lord. Before very long, however, they were damaged by division because of their excessive attention to doctrinal considerations. Because of them, Europe was spoiled for the practice of the church. This poison also spoiled the United States.<p>According to Brother Nee&#8217;s observation, the Lord around 1920 had a need for His recovery to be carried on. Because both Europe and America were no longer pure soil, the Lord was forced to go to a heathen, primitive land. Concerning the church practice, China was virgin soil. The gospel had been brought there. The Bible was there. The Lord&#8217;s name was known. The denominations also, sorry to say, were present; but there was little Brethren practice. Sixty years ago China was truly virgin soil in the matter of the church life. This afforded the Lord a new beginning, distinct from the denominational practices and purely according to the Bible.<p>Now sixty years have gone by. Revelation after revelation has come to us. It is not surprising that when Brother Nee&#8217;s books were translated into English, many seeking Christians were ready to devour them. New light was there. New expressions were used. Remember that the source was the Nazareth of China. Can anything good come out of Nazareth (John 1:46)? Yes! That was where Jesus Christ came from!<p>The Lord has very much opened up Romans 8 to us recently. For fifty years I have been speaking on Romans 8. Now it has become a new chapter. The other day I was looking into Godet&#8217;s exposition of Romans 8. What is there is old and general. It is common to a number of seeking Christians. Where can we find something fresh about the law of the Spirit of life?<h2 class=head1>NOT RELIGION, ETHICS, NOR PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>Western culture is based upon Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. When we say that the West is under the influence of the Hebrew religion, we are including Judaism, Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. The Hebrew religion presents people with God and ethics. The essence of religion is to behave and teach according to one&#8217;s beliefs about God. The Jews have a belief about God. I do not say they believe in God. I believe in God-I am not boasting-but my Jewish friends only believe about Him. They do not really believe in Him. In any case, because of their belief, they preach and teach their children about God and try to behave according to what they believe. The western world, Europe and America, is made up of the descendants of Japheth, one of Noah&#8217;s three sons. These make up the white race. They are under the influence of the Hebrew religion and its offshoots.<p>The Chinese are under the teachings of Confucius. Even in their dreams the Chinese people, some nine hundred million of them, are governed by his ethics!<p>In this message what I have to say is beyond the Hebrew religion. It will leave the teachings of Confucius far behind. The pure revelation of the Scripture levels all of them. According to the revelation of the Bible, I say to the westerners, Forget the Hebrew religion! To the easterners, Forget Confucius&#8217; teachings! I have no choice. I have a commission and a burden. The Apostle Paul also acted according to this principle. He offended both Greeks and Jews, calling them both fools and stressing that God alone was wise (1 Cor. 1:19-27; 2:6-16).<p>We must come back to the Bible. What I have to say is extraordinary. If you have a Chinese background, as you read, do not entertain the thought that Confucius deals with this point also. If you come from a western background, as you are reading, do not say to yourself, &#8220;My pastor said the same thing five years ago!&#8221; What the Bible teaches is higher and deeper. Please learn to pick up the God-given discernment. The focus of what the Bible reveals is other than what Confucius and the Hebrew religion teach.<h2 class=head1>MAN-SMALL YET LIKE GOD</h2><p>We have a new message, vital though unusual, on the two trees in Genesis and the two laws in Romans.<p>Consider the universe God created. Scientists today have learned something of how vast it is. The universe is composed of perhaps forty billion galaxies. One galaxy is made up of two hundred forty million solar systems. The distance from the earth to the moon is just a short length in one solar system. Besides the vastness of the universe, there are the billions of items it contains, too numerous to mention. One of these items, the Bible, God&#8217;s Word, tells us that God created man, another item, in a particular way. Man was not God, but He was made in God&#8217;s image and likeness.<p>Romans 11 tells us that we believers in Christ have been grafted into God. (Romans 6:5 has this thought also.) For a branch from one tree to be grafted to another, the two trees must be close in nature. Apples, for example, will not grow on peach trees. An almond branch, however, can be grafted to a peach tree because the two are quite close. If our human life were entirely different from God&#8217;s, there would be no possibility for the two lives to be grafted together. Man&#8217;s life is not the divine life, but the two are close because man&#8217;s life was made according to the image of God&#8217;s life. A believing human being can be grafted into God because human life was made in the form of God&#8217;s virtues. God has love; He made love for man. But His intention was to use this created love of man as a container for His own real love. When the divine love enters into man&#8217;s love, they are grafted together. Then the two love together. You and God love your wife or your neighbor. It is the love of a human being filled up with the love of God. The almonds produced by the branch grafted to the peach tree result from the mingling of the two lives.<p>The love of Jesus was like this. When He was on this earth, He loved people as a man; yet in that human love was the love of God. The love of God mingled with a man&#8217;s love. Was it a human or a divine love? It was a fruit brought forth from the mingling of two lives. People were curious about the Lord Jesus. Who was He? Was He not a carpenter? Was He not the son of Mary? Did they not know His brothers and sisters? What was there about Him that was so unusual? How could He be so different? It was because God was in Him. He was a God-man!<p>The same can be said of all of us, the members of Christ. Surely my love for you is not merely that of an elderly, Chinese man; in my love there is the sweet love of God. This is the Christian life. A Christian life is not the divine life; nor is it merely a human life. It is a mingled life. It is a human life redeemed, terminated, resurrected, uplifted, and indwelt by the divine virtue. To make tea, we add tea leaves to water. The water indwelt by the tea becomes tea water. It is not tea alone, nor water alone; it is tea water. The two have been mingled together. The Christian life is a human life mingled with the divine life.<p>When we read Genesis 1, it is not till we get to the last few verses that we find the greatest thing that was created. It was not the heavens nor the earth, but a small man. He was the greatest because he alone was made in the image and after the likeness of God.<p>Before the incarnation of Christ, God came to His people a few times in the form of a man. In Genesis 18 He came with two angels as a man. The Bible says three men came. Abraham washed His feet and served Him a meal, which He ate. That was God. Then in Daniel 3 when the three friends of Daniel were cast into the fiery furnace, there appeared with them a fourth person, whose form was like a son of God. God, then, took the form of a man even before He became a man. This we cannot explain, but it shows us that man resembles God. According to the biblical revelation, man closely resembles God. This is why man can be grafted into God and the two lives can live together as one life.<p>When Paul said (Gal. 2:20), &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me,&#8221; who was living? It was Christ. Yet Paul went on to say, &#8220;And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith.&#8221; When Christ lived, Paul lived; when Paul lived, Christ lived. The Lord Jesus foretold this in John 14:19: &#8220;Because I live, you shall live also.&#8221; We live in His living; He lives in our living. In other words, we two live together. He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). What a miracle! What a mystery! We cannot explain it, but we know it is so because the Bible tells us so. This is God&#8217;s eternal intention and His economy.<p>After reading the description in Genesis 1 of God&#8217;s creating man, I was looking forward to reading the second chapter. My first reading of it disappointed me. It seemed quite ordinary. The man in chapter one seemed great. In chapter two, however, he was just a piece of clay molded by a potter. Even a little boy can fashion a toy figure out of clay! Then God breathed into man&#8217;s nostrils the breath of life, and that toy became a man. How simple! To build an airplane is far more complicated. Several different departments have to be set up. Different kinds of people have to be hired-some with doctoral degrees, some with other skills. It is a comprehensive undertaking. God used only the dust of the earth and made a little man. Was this the image of God? Was this little figure according to God&#8217;s likeness? When I was growing up in China, we used to make toys like this out of clay. Some were shorter; some were taller. Sometimes we would make nostrils and breathe into them too. There was nothing great about it.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO TREES</h2><p>Then God took this man whom He had created and set him before two trees. Was not this a strange thing to do? I would have thought God would take Adam and talk with him in lecture after lecture, training him in how to behave. He would explain that Eve was his counterpart, that Adam must love her, that she would be the mother of his children, and that Adam must be the head. Then God should have taken Eve and spent time to train her; she would need an even longer time because females always make trouble! If Genesis 2 had been written like this, I surely would have thought it was a wonderful chapter of the Holy Scriptures, written by God.<p>One tree was the tree of life. God did not explain what life was. Even today Bible scholars with doctoral degrees cannot explain the tree of life. Yet it is a simple name. The other tree was more complicated. It was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God did not explain what knowledge was, nor what good and evil were. He simply said that all the trees in the garden were good for them to eat. They could partake of them freely. Only one tree was an exception. He warned them that if they ate of that tree, they would die. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil would bring death. Notice the four words related to this tree: knowledge, good, evil, death. These four words stand in contrast to the one word: life.<p>What is the point of these two trees? Everything else is secondary in God&#8217;s eyes. The only thing which is crucial is that man eat of the proper tree, the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>From the rest of the Scriptures we know that the tree of life is Christ as the embodiment of God. In the last book the Lord promised the overcomers in the church that He would give them to eat of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7). For eternity the tree of life will be in the New Jerusalem to feed and satisfy God&#8217;s redeemed people (Rev. 22:2). The other tree will be done away with; its end will be the lake of fire.<p>These verses strongly indicate that God&#8217;s intention was that the man whom He had created according to Himself would take of the tree of life. To eat of the tree of life means to take God in as nourishment. We know this because the Lord Jesus told people that He Himself was a tree, the vine tree, and also that He was the bread to be eaten (John 15:1; 6:57-58). &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; To eat is to take in what can be digested and can provide nourishment by being assimilated into the cells to become their constituents. The term &#8220;to eat Jesus&#8221; is not found in Christianity&#8217;s dictionary. Some think it is too crude a way of speaking. Yet in the verse we have just quoted, the Lord Himself speaks this way (see also John 6:50-56). In the typology of the Old Testament there is the manna, which typifies Christ as food.<p>God&#8217;s intention is to plant Himself into you as the tree of life. This planting is grafting. This thought is implied in Romans 6:5. Has God been planted in you? Are you a garden with God as a dear little plant growing in you? Is this plant, called the tree of life, growing in you? Are you growing, or is He growing? May God be merciful to you and grace you, that you may grow together with Him and that He may grow together with you!<p>Colossians 2:19 says that we should grow with the growth of God. As God is growing in us, we must grow with Him. If we are growing by ourselves, improving ourselves so that we are more patient, humble, or loving, we may be disciples of Plato or Confucius, but we are not disciples of Christ. A disciple of Christ, a Christian, must be growing together with God. Such a tree has been planted into us.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>When we come to the second tree, we find Satan&#8217;s counterplot. Satan seeks to act ahead of God. When he finds out what God intends, he tries to step in and act first. God&#8217;s intention was to plant Himself in man. God, however, does not act in haste. It is not that He is slow or patient; the right word is steady. Thus He did not plant Himself in man immediately.<p>It is strange that after creating man, God waited. He did not enter Adam right away. This gave Satan an opportunity. In Genesis 3 the subtle one came. He spoke to the woman, not to the man. Sisters, Satan&#8217;s way is to tempt you to open your mouth. &#8220;Hath God said...?&#8221; A question mark is in the shape of a snake. Eve should not have answered. She should have gone to her husband and let him answer. Instead, she responded to the serpent&#8217;s question. By opening up, she was ensnared and ate of the tree of knowledge with Adam. The evil one thus planted himself in mankind.<p>After Satan got into man, God came. Adam&#8217;s satanic nature came forth. Instead of confessing his sin, he blamed God. &#8220;The woman whom thou gavest&#8221; was the cause of the trouble. If God had not given him a wife, there would have been no problem. When God then spoke to Eve, she did not take the blame either. &#8220;The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat&#8221; (3:13). God, she implied, allowed the serpent to be there. This way of talking is from the satanic nature. Even though Adam and Eve were new on the earth, from that time on they were old. They became the old man. In the second generation Cain hated his brother and killed him. Throughout the Bible two lines can be seen. One is of the tree of life; the other, of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ANSWER</h2><p>Man fell. Before the tree of life got into man, the second tree entered into him. Was this an emergency? It may seem so to us, but God waited.<p>Many years went by. After two thousand years, He came to Abraham, promising him that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 22:18). Another two thousand years went by. Four thousand years after the fall, God came. He came into man by the birth at Bethlehem. Isaiah 9:6 says that that child&#8217;s name was the mighty God. The mighty God became a human child! That human child was the Son; that Son was called the eternal Father. His name is Wonderful!<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He lived among thousands of men who had the second tree, the satanic life, growing in them. Do you remember what He called the Pharisees? These people were respected as highly moral and religious. Jesus, however, called them vipers (Matt. 12:34; 23:33) and serpents. The Devil was their father (John 8:44). The Lord Jesus knew that all Adam&#8217;s fallen descendants were children of Satan. Because Satan was growing in them, they lied, committed fornication, stole, hated, and murdered. When the Lord came to this earth, wherever He went He saw sins, sicknesses, and diseases. Satan had fully saturated mankind. He was not only among men but within them. He was like an incurable cancer, spreading in their cells.<p>What shall we say about American society? It too is filled with the Devil. This seems to be a great Christian country, but actually it is permeated with Satan. Satan is growing in every part of American society. Not only in Hollywood, but in the department stores, in the hairstyles, and in the clothing, Satan is growing. Before we were saved, we were growing together with Satan. Even afterwards, because we are short of grace, we are still sometimes growing with Satan. A tree that brings death, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, is growing in humankind.<p>But there was One born among men as a little babe. He grew to be a child and then a young man, growing all the time with God. He was a God-man. He was the only One. How could He become many? He Himself told us. He was a grain of wheat, falling into the ground and dying, thus bringing forth many grains (John 12:24). He went to the cross and died. He was buried. On the third day He arose. We all arose with Him. He has imparted His life into all who believe in Him. Now we are all His members and God-men like Him.<p>God-man is not a heretical term. It has been used by a number of Christian writers. Moses was called a man of God (Psa. 90, title). Paul called Timothy a man of God (1 Tim. 6:11). He did not call him a man of good; he was not to express good but rather God.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO LAWS</h2><p>Every life is a law. Every tree is a law. The law comes from the tree. When the tree of life enters into us, it becomes a law. The tree of good and evil also becomes a law within us. Since we have two trees growing within us, we have two laws, not as commandments but as set-up principles. These laws of nature work within us, not by activities but by law. Our stomach digests food according to law. It does not refuse to digest our food if we offend it! When we have eaten, whether we have offended our stomach or not, it spontaneously carries on the digestive process. Digestion is according to law, not activity.<p>There are two laws working within us. One is Satan, called sin by Paul. &#8220;For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me&#8221; (Rom. 7:19-20). He is using the term sin in a personified sense here. Like a person, sin can deceive (v. 11), kill (v. 11), dwell within (vv. 17, 20), and do evil contrary to one&#8217;s will (v. 20). This is Satan in our nature, in our flesh. This sin is a satanic life within a satanic nature. It is a law, the law of sin and of death. It works within us by law unto death.<p>But we have another law! This law is the Triune God, after being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. He is now the Spirit indwelling our spirit. He is a law, the law of the Spirit of life, working within us not by activity. If a building has no electricity, we can have light only by an activity. Once electricity has been installed, however, it works by law. We do not need to beg the power plant to give us light. All we need to do is turn on the switch. Electricity is complicated, but once it is installed it is easy to apply and practical to use.<p>The two trees in Genesis are the two laws in Romans.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAR AGAINST THE LAW OF GOOD IN OUR MIND BY THE LAW OF SIN IN OUR MEMBERS AND THE FREEDOM FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH BY THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:17-24; 8:1-6, 13, 14-16, 23</h1><h2 class=head1>THE CONFLICT IN MAN</h2><p>In human beings there is a law of trying to do good. This law is in our mind. There is a war going on against this law by the law of sin. This war takes place in our members.<p>The Chinese saints will be familiar with the classical writing on The War between the Principle and the Lust. Chinese scholars centuries ago realized that within man there was a principle and a lust, struggling against each other. They saw that principle was in man&#8217;s mind, his psychological part, and that lust was in his body. Thus they advocated asceticism, the ill-treatment of the body, as a means of dealing with lust. Asceticism was to help the principle in man&#8217;s soul defeat the lust in his body. This conflict was the war between the principle and the lust.<p>When I was quite young, I studied these writings. After I got saved and came across Romans 7, I found that Paul said the same thing. He described the war being waged between the law of good in his mind and the law of sin in his members. The law of good is what the Chinese scholars called the principle. The law of sin Paul also referred to as the evil (Rom. 7:21, 23). Evil is close in meaning to lust, the word the Chinese scholars used. Paul had the same experience, then, as is described in the Chinese ethical writings.<p>Paul&#8217;s experience, however, did not end with Romans 7. In Romans 8 there is something far higher than what the Chinese scholars saw. They never experienced the processed Triune God becoming the Spirit to indwell them.<p>When I preached the gospel to some disciples of Confucius, some were convinced. I pointed them to Romans 8:1: &#8220;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.&#8221; No condemnation! Now it is blessed man, not wretched man! Then I read verse 2 to them: &#8220;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&#8221;<p>&#8220;What you call principle,&#8221; I told them, &#8220;the Bible calls law. Here is another principle-the law of the Spirit of life! Are you familiar with this principle? You know lust. You know evil. But the Spirit and life you do not know. The law of the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus, not in Confucius. Confucius has been dead and buried for centuries. How could you be in him? But we who believe in Christ are in Him! We not only have Christ; we are in Him! This law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death.&#8221;<p>This is the war and the freedom mentioned in the title of the message. The war is between the law of good in our mind and the law of sin in our members. The freedom is from the law of sin and of death, and it is by the law of the Spirit of life. The freedom we are talking about here is not American freedom; it is not a result of Jefferson&#8217;s teachings. It is freedom from the law of sin and of death, and it comes about by the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<h2 class=head1>DISTRACTING INFLUENCES</h2><p>What we are covering here is momentous. In the Far East the ethical teachings of Confucius have controlled people for centuries. His teachings prevailed not only in China but in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as well. In India the people are under the evil influence of Hinduism. Then there is also the widespread influence of Islam. In the western world the influence of the Hebrew religion is dominant. This latter is better than the others. It teaches not only ethics and morality but about God as well.<p>The effect of these teachings is that in the Far East the people have been encouraged to develop their will to practice ethics and conquer lust. Many to some extent were successful and are strong-willed and proud. In the western world people try to live morally and virtuously. In addition, many pray to ask for God&#8217;s help. To some extent, because of their fear of God and worship of Him, He has granted some blessing to them. Even the unbelievers in the western world are under the moral teachings of the Bible. Without Confucius&#8217; ethics the oriental peoples might be wild; without the Hebrew religion the westerners might be barbaric. For the most part, both easterners and westerners give an outward impression of culture and refinement, even though within they are sinful. We may liken them to the scribes and Pharisees in the Lord&#8217;s time. The Lord Jesus saw through their appearance of refinement and religious performance and knew that the poison of the snake was in them. Whatever influence fallen man is under, this is his real inward condition.<p>Many influences play upon us. They differ according to the background we have come from, but their effect is to hinder us from seeing clearly. These influences become layers, blocking our view. Suppose we are wearing green-tinted glasses. We may look at something white, but it will seem green to us. We can still see the object, but not its genuine color. This is the problem when we read the Bible. We may read it day after day, but we are wearing tinted glasses. This is why Paul prayed that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph. 1:17).<p>Generally speaking, all peoples are controlled by ethical influences. The religious ones add to this the matter of their relationship to God. They want to please Him by their worship and service. They want to change others so that they will be better behaved. Missionaries want to spread the kingdom of God. There are organizations to win young people and campaigns to win countries for Christ.<p>Is this effort to bring others into the kingdom of God to be condemned? Is it not good to win others to Christ? It is good, but by itself it is not in the central lane of God&#8217;s revelation. Paul had a stewardship to complete the Word of God (Col. 1:25). Without his ministry the Bible would still be God&#8217;s wonderful revelation, but it would be incomplete. It was left to Paul, and Paul alone, to tell us that the church is the Body of Christ; that Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2); that the church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4-6); and that Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20).<p>Do you treasure Paul&#8217;s writings? Peter does not tell us that Christ lives in us. The highest word from him is that we are partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Many New Testaments are printed which include the Psalms. In the Far East the Chinese have printed a New Testament including Proverbs. The westerners like Psalms; the orientals, Proverbs. What about the central lane of God&#8217;s revelation?<p>You young people do not realize the influences you are under. Have you ever resolved that you will be the number one Christian? that you will never again lose your temper? that you will pray and read the Word every day? that you will be kind and pleasant to others? that you will do your duties in an exemplary way? Such resolves are ethical, moral, religious, virtuous, pious, devotional, even &#8220;spiritual.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE TWO TREES</h2><p>God wants you to realize that He is the tree of life. He wants you to receive Him. He wants to plant Himself into you, to grow together with you, so that you may grow Him, express Him, and live Him. Your virtues, such as love and kindness, were created by God in the form of His virtues. Your human virtues are gloves to contain God&#8217;s virtues. It is not God&#8217;s intention for you to have empty gloves!<p>God&#8217;s desire was to enter into you. His enemy, however, had a counterplot. Before God entered into man, Satan did. The other tree was planted in mankind. All the descendants of Adam, whoever they may be, have this second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, growing in them. This is what accounts for the ruined, evil condition of the world today. When this tree entered into man, it became a law, the law of sin. All worldly people are living according to this law.<p>Four thousand years after this law began operating in fallen man, Christ came! God Himself was thus planted in man. Christ went to the cross. Then through His resurrection He brought us into Himself. Now another tree, the tree of life, has been planted in us. Another law is now operating in us, the law of the Spirit of life.<h2 class=head1>NEGLECTING THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Are we under the influence of this law? Too many of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery still live according to ethics, morality, piety, religion, or &#8220;spirituality.&#8221;<p>Many people are still trying to keep the Mosaic law. The children of Israel have tried in vain to live by it. The Catholic Church charges its members to keep the Ten Commandments. They practice reciting them, as do some Protestant denominations.<p>The New Testament teachings are often neglected or misapplied. In Romans 8, verse 2 is neglected and verse 39 about God&#8217;s inseparable love is picked up. Verse 28, about all things working together for good, is another favorite.<p>&#8220;The law of the Spirit of life&#8221;-this is a strange language! Your vocabulary does not have the Spirit. If it does, you think it refers to tongues-speaking or other miraculous things. When I was in Waco, Texas, some twenty years ago, a friend told me he had seen heavenly gold descending to fill his tooth; he could even smell the metal. I said what he was saying was a lie; I did not believe him. &#8220;If God can fill your tooth with heavenly gold,&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;why wouldn&#8217;t He just restore the tooth?&#8221; Many Pentecostal testimonies are lies. The Bible does record miracles, but not one case of leg lengthening is mentioned. Tongues-speaking in the Bible refers to speaking another language; it is not the three or four syllables of today&#8217;s speakers in tongues. No language is made up of that limited number of sounds. The understanding of the Spirit among today&#8217;s Christians is too poor. Nor do they know what life is. If there is excitement, shouting, or jumping, they think the meeting is full of life. How full of life a ball game is then!<p>May the Lord have mercy upon us. I am not speaking critically. I beg all of you who read this message: unload. Unload yourselves of all your old appreciations and old understandings. As the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;...Turn and become as little children&#8221; (Matt. 18:3).<h2 class=head1>THE LAW OF LIFE IN OPERATION</h2><p>Now that we are saved and regenerated, the Triune God is dwelling in our spirit. There is no need for us to determine to be loving or kind or humble. We need not resolve to be the best husband or wife. These are ethical, religious, even &#8220;scriptural&#8221; aspirations. Listen to Romans 8:2-4: &#8220;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death. For, the law being impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8221;<p>God condemned sin, verse 3 says. Condemned means overcame, subdued, conquered, deprived of its power. This is what God did concerning sin. Sin includes Satan and the law of sin. God sent His own Son &#8220;concerning sin&#8221;; this was because of His enemy Satan getting into man. The word &#8220;that&#8221; at the beginning of verse 4 is a strong word; what follows is the consequence or issue of God&#8217;s condemning sin in the flesh. Because God has deprived sin of its power, the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us. God has not asked us to keep the law; we cannot keep it. The airline does not ask us to fly to New York; it would be beyond our power to do so. What we do is buy our ticket, get the boarding pass, get on the plane, and sit in our seat. Then the flight is fulfilled in us. After five hours&#8217; rest .we shall be in New York. Just as the airline does not expect us to fly, so God does not expect us to keep the law. The righteous requirement will be fulfilled, not kept, &#8220;in us.&#8221; Who is the us? It is those who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit. What does it mean to walk according to spirit? It means that, instead of trying to love others or be humble or be &#8220;spiritual,&#8221; we have regard only for the indwelling Spirit. The Triune God has been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Today He is the life-giving Spirit within my spirit. I am one spirit with Him, and He is one spirit with me (1 Cor. 6:17). This is my only concern. Whatever I am doing or saying, I have my being according to this Spirit. If we walk this way, the righteous requirement of the law will be fulfilled in us. This is not to say that we will keep the law. How will this righteous requirement be fulfilled? It will be fulfilled not by us, but in us, by the law of the Spirit of life.<h2 class=head1>ACTIVATING THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>After reading this message, will you pray like this? &#8220;Lord, thank You for such a message. You know how weak I am. I need Your help. Grant that I may be able to live according to what the message says.&#8221; Do not pray like this! Then what should you do? Be at rest. To activate the law of the Spirit of life, all you need to do is turn on the switch. Romans 8 says:<p>(1)Walk according to spirit (v. 4).<p>(2)Set the mind on the spirit (v. 6).<p>(3)Put to death the practices of the body (v. 13).<p>(4)Be led by the Spirit as sons of God (v. 14).<p>(5)Cry, Abba Father (v. 15). When you cry, the indwelling Spirit cries with you (Gal. 4:6).<p>(6)Witness (v. 16). When you witness, the Spirit witnesses with you.<p>(7)Groan for full sonship, the redemption of your body (v. 23). Say: &#8220;Lord, I praise You that today You are the firstfruit for my enjoyment. Yet my body is old. I need full sonship. My body needs to be &#8216;sonized.&#8217; Not only so, Lord, look upon my brothers in the denominations. Consider their situation.&#8221;<p>If we practice these seven things all day long, we shall find that the righteous requirement of the law will spontaneously be fulfilled in us. God will rescue us and answer our cry, &#8220;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&#8221; (Rom. 7:24). Who? The law of the Spirit of life will free us from our wretched condition if we fulfill the requirements we have just mentioned.<p>We need both the realization and the practice. Then we shall experience the freedom from the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life.</body></html>
