   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 7 THE TABERNACLE 3 The Content</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The real value of the tabernacle altogether depended upon its content, just as the nobility of a house depends upon those who live in it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle was composed of three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, the content of the tabernacle can be divided into three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the record in Exodus 25 through 30, the description of the three sections begins from the Holy of Holies and proceeds to the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, according to our human perspective, the three sections begin from the outer court and proceed to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Outer Court</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were two important items in the outer court: the altar, which can also be called the altar of burnt offering or the bronze altar, and the laver, which is also referred to as the bronze laver.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a priest entered the tabernacle, he first contacted the altar and then the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The altar signifies the Lord s cross, and the laver signifies the washing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the first experience within the church is the cross and that the second is the washing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Altar</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first item within the tabernacle was the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the first item related to the content of the church is the cross, which is typified by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the altar as a type, there are three main points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Place of Expiation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the human perspective, the altar was the place for expiation, yet from God s perspective, expiation is not the only emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The expiating blood of the animals slain for the offerings was sprinkled on and around the altar Lev 1:5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signifies that the Lord was killed and that His redeeming blood was shed on the cross on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, redemption for sin was accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As far as man is concerned, this is the significance of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The altar, however, is also related to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The altar is referred to as the altar of burnt offering Exo 30:28 but never as the altar of sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering was the first offering among five kinds of offerings and denotes man offering himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that man is food to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament, God said that His food was the burnt offering Num 28:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may consider only that God desires to be our food and satisfaction, but the Bible also tells us that man is God s food and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man can be God s food and satisfaction by willingly placing himself upon the altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is similar to Abraham offering Isaac as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to God s original intention, even if man had never sinned, and there was no need for the sin offering, man would still need to present himself to God as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The thought with the burnt offering is not related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the burnt offering, man as a creature puts himself into the hands of the Creator to become the Creator s food and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The altar, as a type of the cross, is related both to the sin offering for redemption and the burnt offering for consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the human perspective the cross has two significances.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is the propitiation of our sin, and the other is consecration so that God may gain our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First we experience the blood, that is, redemption, and then we experience death, that is, our willing consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this regard, the cross deals with our self, our person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we offer ourselves on the altar, the fire consumes us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the perspective of the Lord s work, we have already been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But, experientially, a person s self cannot be dealt with unless he willingly offers himself to God to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a person does not hand himself over to God, he cannot experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order for the experience of the cross to be manifested in a person, he must willingly offer himself up to God and give himself into God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most people do not like to hear the word death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But those with experience know that God s work in us puts us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All those gained by God have been terminated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are clear that death represents God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Giving themselves to God is to put themselves in the position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the meaning of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a person has never experienced death, he has never consecrated himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who have handed themselves over to God have put themselves in the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The picture of the burnt offering shows that the offerer of the burnt offering participated in the slaughtering of his offering and laid his hand on the offering Lev 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This signifies that everyone who consecrates himself to God willingly puts himself in the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The burnt offering was slaughtered by the offerer and was then consumed by God with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the type, we slaughter our own offering and offer it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God then accepts our offering by burning and consuming it with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s consuming of the burnt offering implies His acceptance of it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His consuming of the offering signifies that He ate and devoured it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The experience of the cross involves man s killing and God s consuming, that is, His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The purpose of these experiences is to deal with our person in order for God to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God terminates man on the cross in order to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everyone who is gained by God has been terminated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The extent to which we have been terminated by God is the extent to which He has been able to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Religion teaches that people give themselves to God in order to accomplish a great enterprise, a great work, for God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of speaking comes from those who do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who know God realize that we give ourselves to the Lord in order to be killed, to be put to death, and to be given to God for His acceptance, not in order to do a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everyone who gives himself to the Lord ultimately becomes a sweet fragrance to God and a heap of ashes to man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When something is burned to ashes, it has reached its end. Regardless of whether it is a piece of wood, a sheep, a bull, or a garment, as long as it is burned to ashes, it has reached its end, and there is no further way to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once any matter comes to the stage of ashes, it has reached its final stage.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even after a person dies, his body must still be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, once his body is burned to ashes, it has reached the final stage.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once a bull or a sheep became a burnt offering, it was terminated; that is, it was burned to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God gained it through termination.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Likewise, God gains man by terminating man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God did not select bulls or sheep from the herd or flock and put them on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The act of offering was man s obligation, and it was carried out by man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After man offered the sacrifice, it was God s responsibility to burn it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, the burnt offering means that man gives himself to God to be terminated by God for God s enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God desires to terminate our being, but He is not willing to do the work of putting us on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Instead, He wants us to offer ourselves willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After we have offered ourselves willingly, He consumes us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the experience of the cross in the aspect of death.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In regard to the blood, the cross is for redemption from sins; however, in regard to death, the cross is for the burnt offering, for consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must give ourselves to God in this way in order to have the experience in Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When a person becomes ashes before God, he becomes a fragrance to God, something for God to eat, enjoy, and possess.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the ultimate significance of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God does not desire that we do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the contrary, God does everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God created the earth beneath our feet and the heavens above our head.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God provides the sunshine, water, air, and food that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He also provides the life, wisdom, and power that we require.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God does not have the intention that we do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the Old Testament, when David sought to build a temple for God, God sent Nathan to David to tell David not to build it 1 Chron 17:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God does not desire that man do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead, God is always doing something for man.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The thought and concept of doing something for God issues from religion, not from God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God s only intention is for us to be gained by Him to be food for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The altar deals with man s sin and also enables God to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>These are the significances of the sin offering and the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The cross deals with man s sin and enables God to gain man.</S>
