A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Be quiet, and come out of him!&rdquo; (vv. 23-25). This unclean spirit was not a fallen angel; this spirit was a demon (vv. 32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33), one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan&rsquo;s rebellion (see Life-study of Genesis, Message 2). The fallen angels worked with Satan in the air (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12), and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The possession of people by demons signifies Satan&rsquo;s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The Slave-Savior came to destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8), and the third thing He did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) so that they might be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13), into God&rsquo;s kingdom (Mark 1:15). Five cases are recorded in this Gospel to illustrate this (1:23-27; 5:2-20; 7:25-30; 9:17-27; 16:9).</p><p>Mark 1:27 says, &ldquo;And they were all amazed, so that they discussed among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.&rdquo; This verse speaks not of the Lord&rsquo;s power, but of His authority to cast out demons. For His gospel service, the Slave-Savior had divine authority not only to teach people (v. 22), but also to cast out demons.</p><p>Many years ago, a missionary named Dr. Nevius wrote a book describing many cases of demon possession in China. Throughout China there were instances of demon possession, and in his book Dr. Nevius gives the details of these cases. Today, in a highly cultured and civilized country like the United States, apparently there no longer are cases of demon possession. However, Satan is subtle, and he seeks to possess people in different ways. In his subtlety, he has a way to possess people in highly civilized countries just as he has a way to possess the people in undeveloped countries. Therefore, even today, in the most highly cultured nation, Satan is able to use different means to possess people. For this reason, in our preaching of the gospel we should have not only the proper teaching, but also the casting out of demons, the casting out of those things used by Satan to possess people. In order to do this, we must learn how to pray to receive the power, even the authority, to cast out the possessing element. Once we receive this power and authority, then our preaching and teaching will come forth with the power to cast out the possessing element of the enemy.</p><p>We need the power to cast out the satanic element used by the enemy to possess people in today&rsquo;s modern countries. Satan, the subtle serpent, is very clever, and he knows how to possess people in modern ways. In an uncultured country, he may use an uncultured means to possess people. But in a modern, cultured country, he will use modern, cultured means to usurp people. For example, in the leading colleges and universities, Satan will possess people in an intellectual way. We cannot defeat the enemy&rsquo;s possession of mankind simply by ordinary preaching and teaching. In order to cast out today&rsquo;s demons, in our teaching and preaching we must have divine authority and power. This power and authority can be exercised only in the name of Jesus. Therefore, we need to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and exercise divine authority in and through His name. If we do this, then in our preaching and teaching there will be power and authority to cast out the evil possessing element of the enemy. The casting out of demons, therefore, is the third item of the content of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">HEALING THE SICK</h2><p>In 1:29-39 we have the Lord&rsquo;s healing of the sick. Verse 30 says, &ldquo;And Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and immediately they tell Him about her.&rdquo; This fever may signify a person&rsquo;s unbridled temper, a temper that is abnormal.</p><p>According to verse 31, the Lord came to Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law and raised her up, and the fever left her. According to verse 34, &ldquo;He healed many who were ill with various diseases.&rdquo; Sickness is an issue of sin and a sign of man&rsquo;s abnormal condition before God because of sin. The fourth thing the Slave-Savior did to rescue sinners, as another part of His gospel service, was to heal their sick condition both physically and spiritually and restore them to normal so that they might serve Him (1:34; 3:10; 6:5, 13, 56). Nine cases are recorded in this Gospel to illustrate such healing (1:30-31, 40-45; 2:3-12; 3:1-5; 5:22-43; 7:32-37; 8:22-26; 10:46-52).</p><p>Today every fallen human being is sick. Many are sick physically, and all are sick spiritually. Because every fallen person is spiritually sick, we in the local churches must learn to preach the gospel and teach the truth like physicians. This means that in our teaching and preaching we should give people a heavenly prescription, a divine medicine for their healing. All the saints among us should learn how to preach the gospel and teach the truth in such a way that people are healed. As we are teaching and preaching, we should give others an injection of spiritual medicine that will heal them.</p><p>Among those in the Pentecostal movement today, a great deal of emphasis is placed on miraculous healing. This emphasis is on physical healing. However, we need to care more for spiritual healing than for physical healing. The church people should be so equipped that in their preaching and teaching spiritual medicine is supplied to people in order that they may be spiritually healed.</p><p>According to Mark 1:32, in the evening the Lord healed many who were ill. Then very early the next morning, &ldquo;He went out and went away to a desolate place, and there He prayed.&rdquo; The Lord prayed in order to fellowship with God and to seek His will and pleasure for His gospel service (v. 38). The Slave-Savior did not do the evangelical service by Himself independent of God or according to His own will. Rather, He carried out this service according to God&rsquo;s will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose.</p><p>According to 1:37, Simon and those with him said to the Lord, &ldquo;All are seeking You.&rdquo; The Lord said to them, &ldquo;Let us go elsewhere into the nearby towns, that I might preach there also, for for this purpose I came out.&rdquo; As the Slave of God to serve God in His gospel, the Slave-Savior did not do His own gospel service to fulfill either His own will or the proposal of others. Instead, He fulfilled the will of God who had sent Him (John 6:38; 4:34).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
