<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Growth Being by the Increase<br>of the Triune God within All Its Members,<br>Who Grow into the Head, Christ, in Everything</H2><P>Now that the Body of Christ has been formed, this Body needs to grow. Its growth is by the increase (growth) of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything (Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15). We have seen that 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body. Then it says that we were all given to drink one Spirit. Now that we have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, we need to drink the one Spirit so that the Body may grow. The one Spirit is the supply that we need to grow in this Body.</P><P>Peter says that as newborn babes we should long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it we may grow (1 Pet. 2:2). When we pray-read the Word in the morning, we receive the milk of the word. By this milk we can grow. Matthew 4:4 says that man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The Lord told us in John 6 that He is the living bread which came down out of heaven and that we need to eat Him so that we can live because of Him (vv. 51, 57). By eating and drinking the Lord, we can grow in the divine life, and the Triune God increases within us. The Lord is the living water and the living bread, so we can drink Him and eat Him to grow up into Him.</P><P>We have seen that the Body of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, the bride. A husband cannot marry a bride who is immature, who is still a babe. His bride must be full-grown, fully mature. This shows that we need to grow unto maturity so that we can be the counterpart of Christ.</P><P>This growth is the increase of the Triune God within us. Colossians 2:19 says that the Body grows with the growth of God, the increase of God. The Body of Christ is growing with the increase of the element of the Triune God. The growth of the Body of Christ is not by the increase of knowledge but by the increase of the very God Himself as life.</P><P>According to Colossians 2:19, God is growing within us. When we grow, that means God is growing within us. Day by day as we eat Him and drink Him, as we pray-read His word and call upon His name, we are taking in the very element of God Himself. Thus, He is dispensing Himself into us, transfusing Himself into us. When His essence is increasing in us, He is growing in us. Thus, the Body grows with the growth of God Himself.</P><P>The Body is an organism, not an organization. As members of this Body, we grow unto maturity until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Himself (Eph. 4:13). Ephesians 4:15 says that we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. As Christ is imparting Himself into us, we are growing in Christ. The growth of the Body is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything.</P>
