<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> After Watchman Nee resumed his ministry in 1948, he fellowshipped several times with the brothers about the critical need to provide believers with a spiritual education. As a goal, he wanted to provide basic teachings to every brother and sister in the church so that they could have a solid foundation of the truth and express the same testimony among the churches. <em>Messages for Building Up New Believers, </em>Volumes 1&mdash;3, contains fifty-four lessons for new believers, which Watchman Nee released during his workers&rsquo; training in Kuling. These chapters are rich in content and all-inclusive in scope. The truths are basic and crucial. It was Watchman Nee&rsquo;s intention that every local church use this material to build up its new believers, finishing all the lessons in the course of one year and then repeating the same lessons year after year. Four of the fifty-four lessons appear as appendices at theend of Volume 3. These four messages were delivered by Watchman Nee as part of the &ldquo;New Believers&rdquo; series at Kuling mountain but were later removed from the final, published version. We have chosen to include them as appendices. In addition to these four messages, Volume 1 begins with a message given by Watchman Nee at a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in July 1950 concerning the meeting for the building up of new believers. It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions.</p>
