<P>We should not exercise ourselves to have a clear sight. That is the self. The clear sight comes from our contact with God. Daniel was a person who received vision after vision. That means he had the clear sight. This was not because he exercised himself in his wisdom, in his knowledge, or in his learning. He received the clear sight because he was a person contacting the Lord. The first six chapters of the book of Daniel show us that the overcomers among the captives, including Daniel, were persons who were always contacting God. Then in the last six chapters, chapters seven to twelve, the visions came to Daniel. Today we must be persons who are filled with the Lord, saturated with Him and full of the Spirit. As such persons, we will not be blind. We will be clear in the spirit. However, we will neither judge according to what we see nor decide according to what we hear. We will do our responsibility according to what Christ is, ministering Christ with His salvation to others.</P><P>Daniel 1 shows us how Daniel and his companions overcame the king, Nebuchadnezzar, in not eating the idolatrous diet. Daniel 3 says that Nebuchadnezzar made a golden image and forced the people to worship it, but Daniel's companions refused to do this and were rescued by the Lord. Although Daniel served the Lord in the midst of such a negative situation under a number of Gentile kings, he was not disappointed. Which one of us would remain in captivity to serve the kings of Babylon and Medo-Persia? Surely they were altogether not promising, yet Daniel remained with them. He just ministered God to them.</P><P>In our service as co-workers and elders, we serve with much selection according to our evaluation. It is best not to have any selection, any choice. We should love everyone with the same level of love. We should care for all the saints, even though some may not like us. Nearly all the elders, full-timers, and co-workers serve people according to their choice, their preference, and their evaluation. When a certain one invites us to their home, we will go because they are our favorite. If another one invites us we will refuse, excusing ourselves because we are too busy or too tired. This means that we are exercising our choice. Our evaluation of others frustrates us. Our natural sight kills us.</P><P>We always need to take care of our duty to minister Christ to others. In a church meeting, someone may stand up and say things that bring death into the meeting. The entire congregation may be disgusted and disappointed with this speaking, but we should not be offended by it. Regardless of this we have to do our duty. After this person speaks, we should rise up to give an edifying, encouraging, life-giving word, without rebuking this person. We should give a strong word, ministering Christ to the entire congregation for perhaps ten minutes. Then everyone will be satisfied by our word, and they will have something on which to feed.</P>
