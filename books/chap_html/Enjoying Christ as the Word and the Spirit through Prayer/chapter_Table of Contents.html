<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the Summer Training of 1965. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker. The subject of the Summer Training was the inner life and the church life. Chapter seven of this book has already been published in <em>The Enjoyment of Christ,</em> which was spoken concurrently with the messages in this book.</p>
