   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE SPECIALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16; Gal 1:23; 2 Tim 4:7; 1 Tim 6:12; Jude 3, 24; Acts 6:7; 13:8; 14:22; Gal 3:25; 6:10; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 3:8; Titus 1:13; Rev 14:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this book I have the burden to cover the speciality, generality, and practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter I will begin to cover the speciality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all must know what it is in the church life that is so special.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The speciality of the church life is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament the word faith is used with two different meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, it means the action of believing Rom 5:1; Eph 2:8; Heb 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have faith in the Lord Jesus, and this is the action of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the subjective meaning of the word faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is also the second meaning, that is, the objective meaning of the word faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Faith used in this way refers to the things in which we believe, the object of our faith, our belief Titus 1:4; Rev 14:12; 2 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So when we say the speciality of the church life is the faith, we mean the faith which is the object of our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what we call our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Christians we have a unique faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said he fought the good fight and kept the faith 2 Tim 4:7 , and he also charged Timothy to fight the good fight of the faith 1 Tim 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jude told us to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints Jude 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The faith mentioned in these verses does not mean our believing action, but refers to the things in which we believe for our salvation and for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the verses listed at the beginning of this chapter are related to this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the faith is something unique, something specific, something special.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in the church life we have only one thing that is specific or special.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That is the faith, our Christian faith, which is composed of the beliefs concerning the Bible, God, Christ, the work of Christ, salvation, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We believe that the Bible, word by word, is divinely inspired by God 2 Pet 1:21 , as the breath of God 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The genuine Christians do not have any doubt about this point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must believe that the Bible is God's infallible Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is uniquely one, but triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 3:16-17; 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 2:18; 3:14-17; Rev 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Godhead is distinctively three, but They are not three Gods separately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament and in the New Testament the Bible tells us definitely that God is one Deut 4:35, 39; Psa 86:10; 1 Cor 8:4; 1 Tim 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among the Christians there were some who believed that the Father was one Person and the Son was another Person, but the Spirit was just a power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others believe that the Three of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These concepts, strictly speaking, are heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have to believe that, according to the divine revelation of the Holy Word, our God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have only one God who is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet, we are unable to define Him thoroughly because our mentality is so limited.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, we cannot even define ourselves very well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know that we have a spirit, a soul, a heart, etc., but it is hard to define them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How then could we define the Triune God so thoroughly?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We could only believe what is clearly revealed in the Holy Word, that is, God is one but triune.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the second item of our Christian faith.</S>
