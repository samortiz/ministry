   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S PURPOSE DEFINED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter, we saw that a priest is the type of person that God planned to have for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is not merely a person serving the Lord, but one who is in reality mingled with the Lord to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not many Christians talk about the eternal purpose of the Lord, because very few are clear about God s ultimate intention.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to know the real priesthood, we must first know the spiritual, eternal intention of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible shows us that God s intention is to work Himself into us that we and He may be fully one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, God comes into man to be fully one with man, so that it is hard to discern which part is God and which part is man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the Lord was on the earth, He did many things, the source of which people could not discern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They could not tell whether they were done by God or by man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was because Jesus, that wonderful person, was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the very God, He became incarnated as man to be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the principle of incarnation, and this principle reveals the real meaning of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One stronghold in the human mind is the concept that man must work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we were Christians, we simply forgot about the Lord and never talked about God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once we turned to the Lord, we began to exercise our mind to think what we must do for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These thoughts flood into our mentality all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not of the Lord, but of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two sources exist in the whole universe the divine source and the satanic source.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two trees in the garden reminded Adam of these two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tree of knowledge reminded him that Satan is the source of death, and the tree of life, that God is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may read the Bible many, many times, yet never realize that knowledge, work, and even good things other than God do not belong to the divine source.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They always belong to the source of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To do something for the Lord may be good, but its source is the wrong tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize that to do something for the Lord is awful, even terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What brought death into humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was the tree of knowledge, and any consideration of doing something for the Lord comes from the same source.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s only intention is for us to open ourselves to Him and let Him come into us to fill us and be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He will do something through us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever He does through us will flow out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the real service which God is seeking today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have the spiritual understanding of the Bible from beginning to end, we will realize that this Book never commands us to do anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is continually presenting Himself to us as enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible shows us that we must enjoy God; we must eat of Him and drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must take Him as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the tree of life is at the very beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of the Bible, we find the tree of life again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the beginning to the end of the Bible, the tree of life signifies that God is our life supply and our enjoyment in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we will be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we will be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we will be taken over by Him; and the more we enjoy Him, the more we will be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said, I am the bread of life...he who eats Me shall also live because of Me John 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And to those who receive Him, He will be in them a well or spring of water John 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must forget about working.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God only intends for us to enjoy Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are many, many ways to speak about this one thing: to breathe Him, to take Him, to drink Him, and even to absorb Him as the sunlight.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only then will we be fully occupied, filled, saturated, and permeated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when we are one with Him in this way will He work something out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible gives many different illustrations to show us this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Look at the branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They simply abide in the tree and absorb or enjoy the riches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When these branches are filled with the riches and saturated with the life-juice of the tree, something will be worked out through the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the real meaning of John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This very simple matter has been totally missed or lost by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God intends to work Himself into us in such a way, for only then will we be in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A priest is a person who is filled, saturated, and permeated with God until he is one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God will then express something of Himself through such a person.</S>
