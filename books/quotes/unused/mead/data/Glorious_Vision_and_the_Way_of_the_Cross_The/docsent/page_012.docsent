   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING HUMAN THROUGH THE PROPER HUMAN NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To be human is to take the proper way of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to have the proper moral ethic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The humanity of one who serves the Lord must be: 1 a coming forth of God and 2 fully human, that is, it must have the proper human flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is no human flavor, at best it will be like an angel, and at worst, it will be like a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For us to serve the Lord, we must not be like angels or demons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to be human, we must be like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we go to the villages for the gospel outreach, and we give others the impression that we are like angels, I am afraid no one would dare to come close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we need to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This also is a part of our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE NEED FOR THE EXCELLENT VIRTUES IN SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The highest morality is one in which divinity is added to our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the divine attributes of God expressed in the created virtues of man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also the most excellent virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our understanding of the Bible and our personal experience, there are seven items of these excellent virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Extraordinary Love</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Love is the first item of these excellent virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This love is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can love to an extent that we even love our enemies Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Boundless Forbearance</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To forbear is to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we forgive, our hearts have to be boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A narrow person cannot forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we need to have a boundless forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to forbear to an extent that we can forgive our enemies and those who hate us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to our experience, it is easier to love our enemies than to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we can love others but cannot forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, I can love you, but I may not be able to forget that you have offended me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because I love you, even though you are my enemy, I can give you a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it is very difficult for me to forget the offense that you have done to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, it is not easy to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, the Lord set a good example for us in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although men reviled Him unceasingly while He was on earth, His last act on earth before He died was a prayer for man, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing" Luke 23:34a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is boundless forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unparalleled Faithfulness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to deal with others with consistency and in faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not betray others or the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There must be unparalleled faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Absolute Humility</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our humility has to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not only do we have to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to be in humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be humble is to be low, but to be humiliated is to be made small.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To serve the Lord we need an absolute humility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Utmost Purity</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only do we have to be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to be pure as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And this purity must be to the utmost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Supreme Holiness and Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Towards God we have to be supremely holy, and towards man we have to be supremely righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Towards God we have to be fully separated, and toward man, we have to be fully proper, with no fault whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is supreme holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brightness and Uprightness</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first item is love, and the last item is light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brightness to which we refer here is different from the brightness the world talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we mean light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to walk in light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything we do must be in the light and must not be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be thoroughly upright and forthright, and must not be narrow-minded or suspicious in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the seven items combined give a proper humanity for a servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In conclusion, the Christian humanity is a life lived out through the mingling of the divine attributes and the created human morality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Lord preserve us to serve Him all the days of our life, without turning back or deviating.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May we all live out the proper humanity of one who serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord be merciful to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 14, 1989</S>
