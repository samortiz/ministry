<h2 class="head2">Shu County, Anhwei Province</h2><p>Although we do not write often, in my spirit I feel that our fellowship before God is like one family around the same father. Shu County, Anhwei, has not been affected. The trains continue on schedule. If the environment permits, I will go to Kweilin to work for three months. Sisters Jiao Wei-jen and Chang Jing-shan are still living in Hwai-Yuen. The people in the church there are all safe. I believe you are praying for us just as we are praying for you. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Your servant in the Lord,<br />Cheng Ji-guei<br />February 26</p><p>(According to a letter from a brother in Hankow, Mr. Cheng  Ji-guei has passed through Hankow and gone on to Kweilin. His family is staying temporarily in Ch'ang-sha. We were very worried about Sisters Jiao and Chang. Thank the Lord for this letter&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Sien-You, Fukien Province</h2><p>We are wiring X dollars collected from the Lord's Day offering. Please accept it and distribute it to the work in the remote regions or to the brothers and sisters in need because of the war. The Lord willing, Miss Bao Hsu-min will come to Sien-You in the middle of this month to edify the sisters. Please pray for this. We have heard that Brother Nee went to England. Will The Open Door continue to be published? We are concerned about this! (Brother Nee left for Singapore on March 5. He will pass through India on his way to England in a little more than a month. The Open Door will continue to be published every month&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>From the church in Sien-You<br />Your little child in the Lord,<br />Tseng Kuang-yu<br />March 8</p><h2 class="head2">Han-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>It has been more than a month since we parted in Shanghai. I hope that by the presence of the Lord's grace, your body and spirit have been blessed with peace. I received the Local Newsletter and The Open Door. Through them I learned about the travels of the brothers and sisters and the news of the work in all the localities. Thank you. May the Lord bless this publication work which enables those in Christ to have fellowship and to love one another in a practical way. Through such a publication, there can be the mutual exhortation, comforting, and care, as well as the promotion of the gospel in one accord to the glory of the Lord's name, amen! After leaving Shanghai on January 14, I arrived in Fukien on the sixteenth. I stayed in Foochow for one week and returned to Han-Jiang on the twenty-fourth. I was cared for by the Lord's grace and arrived home safely. I am writing so you will know and not worry. I am now at home without a job. Please pray much for my future. May the Lord's grace be with you. Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Fang Jia-je<br />March 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Feng-Ting, Fukien Province</h2><p>Please receive X dollars from the offering box in our locality from the past two Lord's Days, c/o Brother Yueh-chiao of Shanghai.
