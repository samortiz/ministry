   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWELVE 1 Scripture Reading: John 12:1-50 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NINE CASES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter twelve we have a conclusion of the first part of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out in previous messages that nine cases are presented in chapters three through eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is a case of regeneration, and the last is a case of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the cases in John direct us to a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mankind fell, and we became the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter whether we are good or evil, as long as we are the old creation, we need Christ for our regeneration and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were sinful and dead, and we need a new life, a new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to become something absolutely new, we need to be regenerated and thoroughly resurrected from the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we shall become new, not in our natural life, in the Adamic life, but new in Christ and in the divine life, which is the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the significance of all these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, as we shall see, in these cases we have the fulfillment of the offerings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS God's Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Old Testament there was a center, and that center was God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, God's dwelling place was the tabernacle, and later His dwelling place was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the Old Testament is a history of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apparently the book of Genesis has nothing to do with God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, the book of Genesis has much to do with the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's dwelling place was not merely the tabernacle and the temple; His dwelling place was a people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tabernacle and the temple were symbols of the children of God as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's people were descendants of the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose lives are recorded in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in Genesis we have the forefathers of those people who eventually became God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The history of the Old Testament is a history of this dwelling place, which is symbolized first by the tabernacle and later by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Need of the Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for God's people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with Him, there was the need of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In front of the tabernacle was an altar, where different offerings were offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These offerings were of five main categories: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recently we gave a series of messages on the offerings printed as the book Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In those messages we pointed out that the burnt offering and the meal offering are a pair, that the sin offering and the trespass offering are also a pair, and that between these two pairs we have the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that only the One who is absolute for God is qualified to be the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As this absolute One, Christ is the burnt offering offered to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, He is the One qualified to be our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is clearly revealed in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The book of Hebrews indicates that Christ was the One who was absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, He was the unique One qualified to be the sin offering to deal with our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering, so the trespass offering is supported by the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ, the only perfect One, was qualified to die for us and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the meal offering, He was qualified to bear our sins, trespasses, and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He alone was qualified to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the burnt offering, Christ was qualified to be the sin offering, and as the meal offering, He was qualified to be the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the One who was absolute for God was qualified to be our sin offering, and the One who was perfect in His humanity was qualified to be our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we have Christ, the absolute One, for our sin offering to deal with our sinful nature and when we have Christ as the perfect One for our trespass offering to deal with our sinful deeds, we have no more problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then this Christ becomes our peace offering for us to enjoy with God and with one another as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that the peace offering is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we come to the Lord's table, we come to a feast, and this feast is Christ as our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the peace offering, Christ satisfies God, and He also satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, He is the peace between us and God and our peace with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is also the peace between a brother and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without Christ as the peace offering, there can be no peace between a husband and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without Christ, there would not be any peace among the brothers and sisters in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is our peace, and this peace becomes our enjoyment at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every week on the Lord's day we come together to feast on Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We enjoy Him before God and with God, and we enjoy Him with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This peace offering is the issue of the other four offerings.</S>
