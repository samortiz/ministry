   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE INCREASE AND BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND TEACHING Scripture: 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Tim 2:2, 15; Heb 10:25</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since October 1984 I have returned to Taiwan many times, but instead of my burden decreasing, it has increased with each visit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am filled with hope for Taiwan, and I have faith that the gospelizing and truthizing of Taiwan is not a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord s recovery will be successful in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CALLING PEOPLE TO JOIN THE LORD S ARMY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many brothers and sisters are willing to offer themselves for the present move in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are joining the Lord s army; they are enrolled in Calvary s hosts Hymns, #473 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This work is not what is commonly called a revival work in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord is calling us to enroll in Calvary s hosts, that is, to give everything for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must spend our time, strength, and money, and we must give our spirit, soul, and body, our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most important thing in an army is the morale of the troops.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The highest demand with regard to the morale is that the soldiers have no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone in an army must put aside his individual thoughts and views and have one heart and one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they can be in oneness without any differing opinions or goals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past we stressed the truth that the ministry is for the churches but that the churches are not for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the churches need to be in one accord with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the churches are not in one accord with the ministry, the ministry has no way to build up the churches or to fight for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we say that the ministry is for the churches, we mean that the ministry builds up the churches; the ministry does not build up itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we say that the churches are not for the ministry, we mean that the churches are not for the building up of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this does not mean that the churches should not be in one accord with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, every country needs an army, but the army is not for itself; the army is for the country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the country must supply and support the army.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whoever is of military age in a country should fulfill his military service and be in one accord with the army.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the army will be able to fight for the country.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, every citizen must be in one accord with the army and support it even if he cannot join the army.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way all the citizens can be for the army.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way the churches must be in one accord with the ministry, supporting the ministry and being for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not calling the entire church to join the army.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a call for a group of brothers and sisters to fight for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result of their fighting is for the churches, not the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever the ministry does is for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ministry builds up the churches in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the Lord s recovery has more than six hundred churches all over the earth, and they are all supplied by the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I came to Taiwan in 1984 to establish a model for the building up and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers in America learned about this and wanted to copy what we were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told them that copying is useless and that being in one accord is the most important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed more than five thousand people and helped thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after His resurrection He appeared only to over five hundred brothers 1 Cor 15:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Acts 1 there were one hundred twenty people praying in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These ones were in the Lord s army.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were not afraid of the threats from the Jewish leaders, and they prayed in one accord for the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They did not have any opinions; they simply prayed in one accord for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Previously they had differing opinions and argued Mark 9:34 , but in Acts 1, Peter and the sons of thunder, James and John, no longer contended.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They prayed earnestly in one accord to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>ELIMINATING CONTROL AND</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT ONE PLEASES</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the degradation of the church the Roman Catholic Church formed a huge religious organization in which the pope occupies the top position and controls everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later Martin Luther brought in the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This promoted an atmosphere of freedom, but it also created a scattered and divided situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity is still filled with this atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christians say that they do not accept human control and justify this by saying that they are following the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone supposedly follows the leading of the Holy Spirit, but the result is that every person has a different leading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This situation can be compared to the situation in Israel during the age of the judges; everyone did what was right in his own eyes because they did not have a king Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the time that the Lord s recovery was raised up, we have rejected control because it is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first twelve chapters of Acts show that Peter took the lead during the first stage of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During the second stage of the church, Acts 13 through 28, Paul took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even though Peter and Paul did not control anything, Timothy and Titus, Paul s co-workers, did not have the so-called freedom to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus, Timothy remained in Ephesus 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Paul said to Titus, Be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, Titus came to Nicopolis Titus 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not the situation today; instead, people say, Even though you want me to go, I must pray to see how the Holy Spirit leads me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Corinthians 16:12 is a special case.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this verse Paul says, Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul fervently hoped that Apollos would go and help the Corinthians resolve their problems, but Apollos said that he did not desire to go at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This was Apollos s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Timothy and Titus, however, were in one accord with Paul and did not do things in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Apollos was also a co-worker, but he was not one with Paul; he had his own views and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This shows that the situation in the early church was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Acts 18:24 clearly says that Apollos was an eloquent man and that he was powerful in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>First Corinthians 3:6 says that Paul planted and Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This one who could expound the Scriptures and teach others did not follow the Spirit to be one with the leading co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This caused some believers in the church in Corinth to say that they were of Paul and others to say that they were of Apollos v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must be one of Gideon s three hundred skilled warriors.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must not say Amen when things are peaceful but when the battle begins, say that we need to reconsider because it is not convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we were in mainland China, many people said, Brother Nee, we want to follow your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They read all the books published by Brother Nee, but when they gave messages, they spoke their own words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They did not pay any attention to what Brother Nee spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brother Nee could not do anything about this.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we want to succeed in the work, we must be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Paul had a group of co-workers who walked and moved in the same step with him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They were in one soul, not merely in one spirit 2 Cor 12:18; Phil 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Romans Paul says that the believers should glorify God with one accord with one mouth 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In 1 Corinthians he beseeches the brothers to speak the same thing 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This means that if the believers could not speak the same thing, it was best for them not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In Ephesians 4:3 Paul, speaking of the oneness in reality, exhorts the Ephesian believers to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Philippians Paul speaks of the practical one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Being one in heart and in soul, thinking the same thing, and speaking the same thing are the foundation for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Many Christians hope to obtain the outpouring, the baptism, of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is never poured out upon individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Holy Spirit is poured out upon the Body of Christ so that the Lord can obtain an army to fight for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The one hundred twenty believers in Jerusalem were in one accord, continuing steadfastly in prayer Acts 1:14 , and the result was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
