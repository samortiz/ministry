   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIFE AND WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Was all this the Lord s work, His move, or His life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, it is difficult to say, for His life was His work, and His work was His move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus was continually living, working, and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day and night He lived, and day and night He worked and moved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His work was His living, and His move was His being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, we cannot say how much the Lord Jesus worked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He worked everywhere and all the time because His work was His life, His life was His move, and His move was His work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With Him there was no difference between His life, His work, and His move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the Lord Jesus every aspect of His life was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We, however, may divide up our life between work, school, family, and church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can easily point out how many hours we work each day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But can you say how many hours the Lord Jesus worked every day?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What time was set apart for His meals?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The point here is that the Lord Jesus was always living, working, and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His preaching and teaching were part of His living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper were also part of the living of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With Him there is no distinction between life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may think that the Lord Jesus was able to live such a life, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we all should live a life of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The common practice of hiring preachers to work as professionals is not right according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every believer should live a life of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, and healing the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we live in this way, wherever we go, our life will be our preaching, for we live a preaching life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, we shall also live a life of casting out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many indulge in certain evil, worldly things because they have been possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My point in speaking concerning this is that the Lord Jesus lived a life of God, and this is a life of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a life of culture, religion, philosophy, or mere ethics or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life that is the life of God automatically preaches, teaches, casts out demons, heals, and cleanses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we all live this kind of life, the situation in our locality will be different after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the matter we are emphasizing is the life itself, the life of God fully according to and for His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RESULT OF LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ACCORDING TO GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seen that the contents of the Lord s gospel service include preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 2:1 3:6 we see the ways of carrying out the gospel service: forgiving sins 2:1-12 , feasting with sinners 2:13-17 , causing His followers to be merry without fasting 2:18-22 , caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation 2:23-28 , and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these matters should be found in our living as Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you live a life of God, after a period of time certain of your colleagues may experience the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then these ones will enjoy the Lord as a feast, having the Lord Jesus as righteousness for their covering and as life for their filling and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then such ones will have freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before you came in contact with them, they were under condemnation and had no real joy, satisfaction, or freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as a result of your gospel preaching, not merely by words but by life, the truth shines into them and they have the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the result of our living a life fully according to the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy is very different from religion, which emphasizes human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s economy is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>ASPECTS OF A LIFE ACCORDING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 3:7-35 we see five auxiliary acts for the gospel service: avoiding the crowd s pressing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>7-12 , appointing the apostles to preach vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>13-19 , not eating because of urgent need vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>20-21 , binding Satan and plundering his house by the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>22-30 , and not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but of the spiritual life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we live a life according to God s New Testament economy, we shall stay away from the crowd and then pray in order to know God s will concerning others living the way we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we shall care for God s need, not for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We shall also bind the enemy and plunder his house.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, we shall deny the natural relationship and remain in the relationship of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these are aspects not of a life of ethics, morality, religion, or culture, but of a life that is of God and according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a life is outside religion, culture, and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a life that lives out God as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the Gospel of Mark is not merely a book of stories or a biography.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Gospel of Mark is a book that presents a life of God, a life that lives God and expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a life fully according to and for the New Testament economy of God.</S>
