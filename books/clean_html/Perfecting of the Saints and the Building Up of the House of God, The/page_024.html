<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPRESSIONS AFTER VISITING CHRISTIANS<br />
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>During the past few months the Lord led me to visit Japan, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and several places in Southeast Asia. After this trip to America and Europe, I spent time before the Lord to consider the situation in those places. I feel that I should fellowship with the brothers and sisters about the situation in the different places and my personal impressions.</p>
<p>During the trip I was surprised to see that Christians highly regard any group of believers who meet in a way that is similar to the way we meet. Whether the group is large or small, strong or weak, it is highly regarded, and it often has good meetings. This surprised me, and I feel that believers think too highly of us.</p>
<p>The churches in Taiwan have an extraordinary reputation. The regard that the Christians abroad have for the churches in Taiwan may even be too high. Whether or not a saint from Taiwan has spiritual weight, the local believers regard him as a spiritual giant. A brother may not even be in the meetings in Taiwan, but if he goes overseas and says that he is from Taiwan, the local saints will hand everything in their meetings over to him. He then has to take the lead and minister the word to supply the saints. This situation has revived and uplifted some brothers who did not meet regularly when they were in Taiwan. Even if the brother says that he does not know what to do and that he cannot speak, the local saints are satisfied if he gives a report concerning what he has seen and heard in Taiwan. These two points indicate that the esteem for us is too high and inaccurate.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO JAPAN</h2>
<p>Our first stop was in Japan. We spent most of our time preaching the gospel in Tokyo, and we spent a few days in Osaka. We were in Japan for two weeks. There are over thirty saints in the bread-breaking meeting in Tokyo, and there are one and a half households in Osaka. During this trip my impression of Japan changed. In the past I considered that it is difficult for the Japanese people to receive the gospel and that it is not easy to lead them spiritually. Such an impression was not founded. While I was there, I contacted several people and saw that my previous impression was inaccurate.</p>
<p>It was easy for us to preach the gospel in Japan, and it was easy for people to be saved. Since the Japanese people have good character, once they receive the Lord, they diligently study the truth and are willing to pay a price to know the truth. This makes it easy for them to love the Lord. When our brothers went to Japan, they did not have gospel preaching meetings or give messages. They only contacted the Japanese people directly and led several of them to salvation. The ones whom they contacted had never heard of the gospel or the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. One brother has a university education, and we conversed with him in English. He is not satisfied with merely being saved; he has a heart for the Lord and a desire to pursue the Lord. Besides him, there were other believers in various places. Two of the saints in Tokyo are Japanese.</p>
<p>In matters related to science the Japanese people are inclined to follow the West, but in matters related to religion they are inclined toward the Chinese people. Consequently, it is easier for a Chinese brother to preach the gospel and labor for the Lord in Japan than it is for a Western missionary, because of the similarity between the Chinese and the Japanese dispositions and daily habits. Many Chinese people develop intimate relationships with their Japanese friends. Therefore, Japan is a vast field for the gospel. We do not need many saints to go there. If five or six workers go to Japan and labor with the saints who are already there, we should be able to gain many people rather quickly.</p>
<p>It is even worthwhile to labor with the ten thousand Chinese people in Tokyo. The brothers can labor in the Chinese communities. It would be easy to spread the gospel from the Chinese communities to the Japanese people. It is difficult to preach the gospel directly to the Japanese, because they value friendship. But it would be easy to reach them through their friends, that is, through the Chinese people residing in Japan.</p>
<p>The brothers in Japan desire fellowship. They hope that brothers will go to Tokyo to labor for the Lord. They are willing to prepare everything, including the necessary paperwork. They are willing to receive workers, and they hope that some will migrate for the sake of the work. I agree with their feeling, and I hope that when we fellowship about this matter in the next workers&rsquo; gathering, some brothers and sisters will be burdened to go to Tokyo for the Lord&rsquo;s work. I believe that immigration procedures will not be a problem, that the Lord will confirm this matter, and that everything will be arranged in a good way. The brothers and sisters should pray concerning this matter. Our work is not for our personal interest or for our own meeting but for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on the earth. Our work is for His gospel and His kingdom.</p>
