JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON ELAM</H2><P>Finally, in Jeremiah 49:34-39 we have Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Elam.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Elam Typifying the World<br>That Is the Enemy of God's Chosen People</H2><P>The forefather of the Elamites was a son of Shem (Gen. 10:22). The nation of Elam was once a province of Media, with the city of Shushan as its capital (Dan. 8:2; Esth. 1:2). The Elamites were enemies of Israel (Ezra 4:9), and in the ancient time the king of Elam was defeated by Abraham (Gen. 14:1, 17). Hence, Elam typifies the world that is the enemy of God's chosen people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Being about to Break the Bow of Elam</H2><P>Jehovah was about to break the bow of Elam, the chief part of their might (Jer. 49:35). He would scatter the Elamites into the nations. He would cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and He would bring evil upon them, even His burning anger. He would send the sword after them, until He would make an end of them (vv. 36-37; Ezek. 32:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Last Days Jehovah<br>Turning Again the Captivity of Elam</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:39 prophesies that in the last days Jehovah will turn again the captivity of Elam. This assures us that Elam will be a part of the restored nations around the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. These restored nations will be the spectators, the observers, admiring God's masterpiece, the New Jerusalem.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> </body></html>
