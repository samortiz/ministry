   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 4:31 says, And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse, first there is the beseeching, the prayer; second there is the Holy Spirit; and third there is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we can see the three things which we shall consider in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three things are prayer, the Holy Spirit, and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the day of Pentecost the disciples were severely persecuted by Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under such persecution, they prayed to the Lord and were filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After this they spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the account of Acts 4:31, on one hand there is prayer, and on the other hand there are the Holy Spirit and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 6:4 says, We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the word and prayer are mentioned in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Building Up Ourselves in Our Most Holy Faith</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jude 20 says, But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse begins with faith and ends with the Holy Spirit and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament the word faith has two meanings plus one additional meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of the first two, one is objective and the other is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The objective faith is our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the truths in which we believe, the contents of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Christian belief includes the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We believe everything in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This belief is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The subjective faith is the act of our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the action and functioning of our believing.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 23 Paul says that in the Old Testament the law was at work to guard the chosen people of God like a fold, keeping the sheep until faith came cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 10:1, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 24 Paul likens the law to a child-conductor to watch over God s chosen people until Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Galatians 3:25 says, But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When faith comes, the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the Old Testament time, the law came.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the New Testament time, faith came.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult to define this faith which came in the New Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For a detailed explanation of this faith, I would encourage you to read the messages in the Life-study of Galatians that deal with this matter.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was buried, and we also were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He rose from the dead, and we also rose.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kingdom will bring in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These are the crucial points of the New Testament, and this is our belief.</S>
