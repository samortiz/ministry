   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE NOT RELATED TO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the third matter, man's responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's grace can never be tied to man's responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What are man's responsibilities?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose I give a brother ten thousand dollars to send to a certain place, but because I am afraid that he will lose the money, I charge him, saying, "You are responsible for this money."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What do I mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I mean that if he loses the money, he has to pay it back.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the meaning of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wrongdoings are matters of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Achievements are also matters of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But responsibilities are matters of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God is to give us grace, it cannot be tied to responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I ask a brother to take ten thousand dollars to the bank, that money is not his, so I tell him that he is responsible for the money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if this money is a free gift to him, can I say, "You are responsible for it"?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Surely not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I give the money away to him, the money is his.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What he does with the money is up to him even if he throws it into a river or a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have said that prior to our salvation we did not have good works and were unable to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was no other way to be saved except to have God's grace save us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But now that we are saved, they say, we should do good works, for if we do not do good works now, we are again doomed to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many think that salvation is of grace, but that maintaining salvation is of our merit and work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what I mean by responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many think that if we behave properly after we are saved, our salvation will be preserved, and if we do not behave properly, God will take back His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If salvation can be taken back, is it grace anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it is grace, there is no question of past merit, present work, or future responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we bring in future responsibility, then again it is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once a preacher came to talk to me who did not believe that once a person is saved, he is forever saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I asked him why he thought so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said that he believed that man is saved by grace, but if man does not behave properly after salvation, he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Is this then grace?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then I gave him an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose we go to a bookstore together and each of us pick out the same book to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you ask the salesman the price, he tells you that it costs sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You give him sixty cents and take the book home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I dig into my pockets and realize that I do not have any money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want the same book also, so I tell the salesman that I have not brought any money with me, and ask if I can take the book now and send him the money later.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He says that it is fine to do so because we know each other well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, I take the same book home also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have paid cash, but I have postponed the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me ask you, was the cash transaction grace?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely it was not, because the book was paid for with sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For man to be saved through good works is like a cash transaction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have done good works, you can go to God and He will say, "Fine, you can be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man is saved this way, his salvation is not through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that no one is saved this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How about my case of postponing the payment?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is like God advancing salvation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If man would not do good after salvation, his salvation will be claimed back from him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One would have to do good in order to keep his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this is not grace either.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Grace is not a cash transaction nor is it like a postponed payment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a cash transaction one pays now; with a postponed payment one pays later.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But both have to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not purchase our salvation on credit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I told the preacher that if salvation is of grace, there is no need for good works.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then he asked, "Does this mean that we do not need good works anymore?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I said, "No. Christians need to do good works.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the good works that I am talking about have nothing to do with salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The good works that I am talking about have to do with the kingdom, with the reward and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Salvation is not bought, nor is it purchased on credit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Salvation is given freely."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What does it mean to give freely?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus said, "And I give to them eternal life" John 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eternal life is given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once I went to buy something at a friend's shop.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He and I know each other very well, so he would not take money from me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said that he would give me the item I wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I could not persuade him to take the money, yet he insisted that I take the item.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the same way, God says that He will give us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not say it only to come back and check on it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not say that it would be ours if we do good and that He would take it back if we do not do good.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not mean that Christians should not have good works.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I hate loose living, but this has nothing to do with my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Salvation is given to us; it is not bought by us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, we should not despise good works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Good works are related to the kingdom reward, to the crown or punishment, but they have nothing to do with salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If salvation is of grace, the question of the future is out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Romans 6:23 says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What is a free gift?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A free gift is a present.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I cannot send a present to your house, and then later send you a bill for it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If it is a present, it is given absolutely free and cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, grace is not related to your past wrongdoings, your present achievements, or your future responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If it is related to your future responsibility, it is not grace; it is a purchase on credit instead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Thank God that eternal life is not a purchase on credit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Thank the Lord that eternal life is God's gift in His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since salvation is given to us by God, we must remember one thing after we are saved: salvation is obtained strictly through believing, and it is preserved apart from our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, the condition for preserving our salvation is the same as the condition for obtaining salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Since salvation is obtained freely it is also preserved freely.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thank God that because the obtaining of salvation is free the preserving of salvation is likewise eternally free.</S>
