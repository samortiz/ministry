   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO CONFESSION AND RECOMPENSE Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7; Matt 5:23-26 I. A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a habit of confessing and recompensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have offended anyone or have come short of anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we have to confess to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man does not confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem develops: It becomes difficult for God's light to shine into a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person must build up a habit of confessing and making recompense so that he can maintain a sensitive and keen conscience before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was once a worker of the Lord who used to ask others, "When was the last time you confessed to someone?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it has been a long time since a person's last confession to another person, there has to be some problem with this person's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a person has offended someone yet has no feeling about it, his conscience must be sick or abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The length of time since your last confession is an indication of whether or not there is a problem between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the period of time is long, it proves that there is a lack of light in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the time is short, that is, if you recently have made a confession to others, it proves that the feeling of your conscience is still sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to live under God's light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to confess to God, and we also need to make confessions and recompenses to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have offended God and the offense has nothing to do with man, we do not need to confess to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not overdo anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother or sister's sins are unrelated to man, having only offended God, he or she only needs to confess to God; there is absolutely no need to confess to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we will pay attention to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of sins offend man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How should a person apologize to another person or recompense another person when he offends him or comes short in his dealings with him?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to be clear about this, we need to carefully study two portions of Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE TRESPASS OFFERING IN LEVITICUS 6</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two sides to the trespass offering: One is revealed in Leviticus 5 and the other in Leviticus 6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chapter five tells us that we should confess to God and offer up sacrifices for forgiveness of our miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter six tells us that it is not enough to offer up a sacrifice to God if we have offended a person materially; we should also restore something to the offended party.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter six says that if we have offended anyone in material things, we should take care of the matter with men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, we also need to confess to God and ask for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But just dealing with God is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot ask God to forgive us on behalf of the ones whom we have offended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How should we take care of the matter from man's side?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us look at the trespass offering in Leviticus 6.</S>
