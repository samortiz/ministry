   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's eternal plan, His economy, is revealed to us throughout the sixty-six books of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the whole creation for the purpose of expressing Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His economy God intended that man should express Himself as the center of His whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MAN NEUTRAL</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BETWEEN THE TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning of the Word of God, we are shown two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to understand God's plan in Scripture, we must be thoroughly clear about these two trees and what they represent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After God created man, He placed him before these two trees, and man's whole life and walk was pictured as a matter of feasting upon one tree or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God instructed man to be very careful about partaking of these two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If man dealt with them in a proper way, he would have life; otherwise, he would have death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How man would live and walk after his creation depended entirely upon how he dealt with these two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God instructed man clearly: if he partook of the second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would have death; but if he partook of the first tree, the tree of life, he would have life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What do these two trees signify?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the revelation of the whole Scripture, the tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree of life stands as a symbol of the life of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Old and New Testament present the Lord Jesus many times as either a "tree" or a "branch" of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has the special title of "Branch" in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many trees are also in Scripture to signify that Christ is our portion and our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For instance, the Lord Jesus, in the second chapter of the Song of Solomon, is likened to an apple tree: "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I sat down under His shadow the apple tree with great delight."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can sit under Him as the shade under His covering and shadow and enjoy all His riches, the fruit of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another example of Christ as a tree is the vine-tree in John 15: "I am the vine, you are the branches..."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the significance of the second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This tree represents nothing else than Satan, the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second tree brings death, because it is the very source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first tree is the source of life, and the second tree is the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the whole universe only God Himself is the source of life, and only Satan is the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A verse showing that God Himself is the very source of life is Psalm 36:9: "For with thee is the fountain of life"; and a verse showing that Satan is the source of death is Hebrews 2:14: "him who has the might of death."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The power of death is in the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, from the very beginning of time, these two trees represent two sources one, the source of life, and the other, the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning, there were three parties God, man, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man in innocence, created by God, was neutral to life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since it was possible for man to have either life or death, he was standing on neutral ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God was standing on the ground of life, and Satan on the ground of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man was created neutral to God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was God's intention for this neutral, innocent man to take God into himself, that God and man, man and God, would be mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man would then contain God as his life and express God as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Created man, as the center of the universe, would then fulfill the purpose of fully expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another possibility, however, was that man would be induced to take the second tree, the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a consequence, man would then be mingled with the second tree.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, that our eyes might be opened to see that in the whole universe it is not a matter of ethics and of doing good, but a matter of either receiving God as life or Satan as death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be delivered from the ethical and moral understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a matter of doing good or evil, but of receiving God as life or Satan as death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is important that we clearly see these three parties!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God, standing on one side, is the source of life, as represented by the tree of life; Satan, standing on the other side, is the source of death, as represented by the tree of knowledge; and Adam, standing in the middle, is neutral with two receiving hands.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can either take God at his right hand or Satan at his left.</S>
