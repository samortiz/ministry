<h1 class="title">BEING SAVED FROM THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BY GOD REVEALING HIS SON IN US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:1-4, 6-7, 10-16, 22-23</h1>
<p>The entire Bible is a revelation from God, breathed out by Him (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20-21), and the order of the books of the Bible is also sovereignly arranged by God. We cannot put Genesis at the end of the Bible, put Revelation at the beginning, or rearrange the Gospels and Acts. Rather, all the books in the Bible are in a proper sequence. In the New Testament we first have the four Gospels, presenting a full picture of a wonderful person, the Lord Jesus Christ. Following this is Acts, with the preaching, propagating, ministering, and imparting of this wonderful One into many persons. After Peter&rsquo;s first preaching, about three thousand people were saved, and later another five thousand believed (2:41; 4:4). Eventually, many people believed in Jesus and received Him into them. In the four Gospels Christ was an individual person, but after being imparted into many people in Acts, this Christ is now in many thousands of believers.</p>
<p>Now what God wants to do with these believers is to bring them together. We Christians can be compared to bees. Bees do not care to be individualistic; they prefer to be corporate. It is difficult to find a bee altogether by itself, because bees always tend to gather together. It is not that they are forced to be together; rather, this is the tendency of their nature. Moreover, when bees are collected together, they lose their identity. It is difficult to identify individual bees in a hive. Butterflies, on the other hand, often behave individually and not in large groups, and their individual beauty stands out for a display. People appreciate the beauty of a butterfly, but bees are not recognized for their individual beauty. This is a good illustration of Christians. We Christians are like bees, not butterflies. We forget about cultivating individualistic beauty in a peculiar way and simply gather together in a corporate way. This corporate life and work are revealed in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>Following Acts is the first Epistle, the book of Romans. Although many would say that Romans is a book on justification by faith, justification is only the beginning, not the goal. The final subject in Romans is the Body of Christ. Chapter 12 begins, &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice...that you may prove what the will of God is&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). This is the will of God not in a general way but in a very specific way. According to this chapter, the particular will of God is to have the Body life (vv. 4-5). This is the consummating revelation in the book of Romans.</p>
<p>Now all the believers who have the life of God in them are a corporate people, because the divine life within them is a collective, corporate life. Deep within every Christian is the desire to &ldquo;flock&rdquo; together. A common proverb says, &ldquo;Birds of a feather flock together.&rdquo; In actuality, it is not having the same feathers that brings birds together; it is having the same life within them. Because we all have Christ as the same life within us (Col. 3:4), we gather together as the Body. It is difficult to enjoy the Lord by ourselves as much as we do in the meetings of the church. This is because we have a corporate life within us, which is Christ Himself. We all have a deep desire to be together with the other saints. This is according to the disposition of the spiritual life within us, which is Christ. This togetherness is the best communal and social life. I have been &ldquo;social&rdquo; in this way for many years. Everywhere I travel, I meet many seekers of Jesus. Out of this spiritual disposition that desires to flock together, the Body is produced.</p>
<p>Although coming together as the Body is wonderful, sometimes certain problems result. Therefore, after Romans comes 1 Corinthians, which shows us the way to deal with the problems. These problems come mainly from two sources. The first source is dead, doctrinal knowledge. The more dead knowledge we have, the more problems there are. The second source of problems is the improper practice of the gifts. Many problems issued from the knowledge and gifts of the Corinthians. Paul tells them, &ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo; (8:1). The divisions that the Corinthians suffered came from their differing kinds of knowledge and practice of the gifts (1:10-12; 12:18-22, 25, 28-30). In contrast to this, Paul says that we were all given to drink one Spirit (v. 13). The best way to solve all the problems is to drink Jesus, who is the Spirit today.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Some say that it is heresy to teach that Jesus is the Spirit. However, if the life-giving Spirit, whom Christ became, is not the Holy Spirit, what Spirit is He? We do not believe that there is another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit. To say this is a real heresy. We believe in the Divine Trinity in the way of the Bible, not in the way of tradition. The traditional teaching of the Trinity gives people the impression that there are three Gods&mdash;the Father is one God, the Son is another, and the Spirit is yet another. Rather, there is only one God (8:4). In 1 Corinthians we are told that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and we have been given to drink of this one Spirit. The way to solve the problems in the church is not to gain more dead knowledge or to have more practice of the gifts. It is to drink of Christ as the life-giving Spirit by calling &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; (12:3b). This causes us to be one.</p>
<p>Following this Epistle is 2 Corinthians, which tells us that Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is the indwelling and transforming One, whom we must behold and reflect with an unveiled face (3:17-18). However, 2 Corinthians does not tell us in detail what the veils are.</p>
