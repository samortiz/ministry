   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this universe there are actually two fathers: God, the Holy Father and Satan, the evil father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, among the human race there are only two kinds of children, God the Father's children and Satan's children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John 3:10 declares we are either children of God or children of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past when I spoke on this matter that fallen human beings possess the life of Satan some said that I should not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I referred them to 1 John 3:10 where it says, "the children of the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Don't you think these children of the Devil have the Devil's life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can you say that you are a child of your father and yet not have your father's life?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If that is the case, you must be an adopted son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan, however, has never adopted anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the sons of Satan were born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What kind of life do you have now?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, you have three lives: the natural, created life, the satanic life, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot deny that we have Satan's life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Haven't you lost your temper recently?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was not an expression of the created life, but of the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am sure the natural life created by God will never lose it's temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the created, human life has no temper, it is very easy for us to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This comes from the life of Satan within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult to be patient; we must work at it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, it is easy to lose our temper; it is spontaneous, requiring no deliberate exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy because we have the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we have three lives, we are quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we were created in Adam, we had only one life the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all were in the garden of Eden in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time we had only the human life a life that was innocent, pure, and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life had no temper and no hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was simply the human life, and God called it very good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time of the fall in Genesis 3, we were injected with another life Satan's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That life produced thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, after the fall, we have the human life and the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every human being has these two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the unbelievers have the human life and the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes you can see the human life in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At other times you can see the satanic life in that same person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps in the morning a husband is a gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when he returns home from work in the evening he may have the face of a "devil-man."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We Christians are even more complicated than this, for when we received the Lord Jesus we received a third life the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the human life, the satanic life, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we have the human life, we can be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have the satanic life, we can be a devil-man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have the divine life, we can be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same person may be a gentleman in the morning, a devil-man in the evening, and a God-man in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since we have the human life, we are in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have the satanic life, we are also in the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we have the life of God, we are in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever I come to a church meeting I see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are in the kingdom of God because we have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A kingdom is the totality of a certain life.</S>
