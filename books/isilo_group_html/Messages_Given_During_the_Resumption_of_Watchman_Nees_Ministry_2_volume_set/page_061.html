Revival</H2><P>The second thing is the work of revival. After people have believed, we have to lead them, old and young, to love the Lord and to have concrete expressions of love. Our money, time, and energy should all be used for the Lord. The few years when we were in Chefoo, the number of saved ones increased, and we began to have many home meetings. The brothers and sisters paid much attention to the work of visitation. Later when the revival came, all the brothers and sisters offered up everything they had and gave up their material possessions, to the extent that this kind of consecration went on from morning until midnight. Even the offering boxes became too small to take care of the offerings. After the revival in 1943, over a hundred people migrated to northwest China for the spread of the gospel. We conducted revival meetings for over three and a half months. Up to a certain point, the brothers and sisters dared not even open up their chests in their homes, or touch their clothes in their closets. The minute they touched their possessions, a voice within would say, "Consecrate!" During that period of time, many miracles and wonderful things happened among us.</P><P>One sister was over thirty years old. Her husband's name was Wang, and he was a rich man in Chefoo. In the villages, they also owned many houses. But he was not zealous at all, and he did not come to the meetings often. During the first month that we conducted our revival meetings, the husband dropped in a few times. Once when he came, I purposely asked him to give a testimony. That day, we happened to be reading Isaiah 1 and Jeremiah 8, which say that the ass knows his owner, but that God's people do not know Him, and that the birds in the air know the season, but His people do not know the judgment of the Lord. I did not know that before the meeting this Brother Wang had already made an agreement with his wife and was about to offer up his land and house deeds to the Lord. The wife thought that I would not normally call out people to testify during the meetings, and she thought that if I would do that to her husband, it would prove that the consecration was of the Lord. The Lord's leading was wonderful. On that day, I invited her husband to testify.</P><P>Before the meeting that day one young brother was at home reading the same passages from Isaiah 1 and Jeremiah 8, and he felt the words quite meaningful that man would be worse than the ass and the birds. Later this brother came to the meeting hall and heard me speaking on these two passages, and he thought that I was directing my speaking to him.</P><P>If a church is not revived, all the teachings it has are dead. If we want to love the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him, we have to do it until it hurts. During that period in Chefoo, we met every day from ten in the morning until six at night, and time was still too short for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Entering the Life of God</H2><P>The third part of the work is to know God's life. When we preach the gospel, we have to know where we are bringing people. We are bringing people into God's life. The gospel preaching is for the revival, and the revival is for ushering people into the life of God. If a man loves money or his career, he cannot be ushered into God's life. The way to be ushered into God's life is first through the gospel, and then through revivals. Revivals mainly cause a person to love the Lord, but there are many revivals that only stir up an exciting atmosphere. I have been a Christian for twenty-two years, and I have never seen a revival as strong as the one in Chefoo in 1943. During that period of time, many times in the meetings nothing was said, yet many were in tears, and many were convicted of keeping back the Lord's grace and of saying that they were living for the Lord while in reality loving themselves. Today we need to have the gospel, and we need to have revivals. Without the gospel and without the revivals, there is no way for us to be ushered into God's life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
