   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Serving Only by the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way to worship in the New Testament is for all of us to use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we attend a meeting, we are a worshipper of God already.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every morning we have a revival, and every day, in our daily living, we are constantly renewed and overcoming and are in constant touch and fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, our lives are filled with hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hymns, #501 and #1068 or a more simple one such as #1024 are hymns that I like to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are all very good songs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can learn to sing them often in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have made an appointment with the brothers and sisters to have a home meeting at 7:30 tonight, then by 6:30 we should be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should begin singing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not begin the meeting at the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we begin it before we leave our house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps while we walk we sing, Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hymns, #309 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not have to wait until we knock on the door before we sing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can sing one stanza for each floor that we ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we reach the saint s home and while we are ringing the bell, we can still sing, Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those inside the door who hear the singing may respond by singing also, Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Floods of joy o er my soul like the sea billows roll, since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children in the house may then echo the singing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How living that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to know that when we meet together we must exercise our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is Spirit, and no one can touch Him without exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said in Philippians 3:3 that the true worshippers are those who are in Christ, who serve by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The content of our meetings should be filled with much singing, praying, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should also have our meetings by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be by the Spirit means that I am a person who starts off the morning in a revived way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am living, and I am daily renewed and daily overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I maintain my spirit in a high position, and I am in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even before the meeting starts, to me the meeting has started in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because I am so living, I do not have to say much when I come to the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All I have to do is to sing a few hymns and the spirits of others are enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is to serve God in the New Testament by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Small Group Meeting Being</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mainly for the Perfecting of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the small group meeting, it may be that I would not come until the set time arrives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I come, I am an observer waiting for others while they in turn wait for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I may call a hymn after ten minutes, and another brother may say, The church has decided that we read the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us all read in turn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the reading with some fellowship and prayer, the meeting is dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what Christianity considers as a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are the programs, the procedures, and the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But there is no Spirit, and there is no supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The meeting is dead, and the church suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we attend a meeting in the new way, first, we must be a man filled with the Spirit and with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On our way to the small group meeting, we should sing, Since Jesus came into my heart! while we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those brothers and sisters who hear us, respond by singing, What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought...</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps another one would sing, Oh, what a life!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Oh, what a peace!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Christ who s all within me lives Hymns, #499 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of singing back and forth, each with his own song, will enliven our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no need to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will touch one another s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the meeting, there should be singing and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the singing, someone should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There need not be any definite person to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can all say, Lord, we do praise and thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is such joy, that You are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not necessarily have to close our eyes either, or to tell everyone to bow their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord Jesus prayed, He lifted up His eyes to heaven John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>None of the above forms are found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are merely old ordinances of the worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What we need to do is to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After this, another might open his mouth and say, Brothers and sisters, how wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This morning I read Romans 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There Paul beseeches us by the mercies of God to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Previously when I read these verses, they were not as sweet as they were this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That is why I was never able to present myself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But this morning I consecrated myself thoroughly to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the brothers and sisters hear this, immediately they will praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The speaking does not stop with this one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Two or three follow the first one, and the place is filled with praises and thanksgivings!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then, a newly saved brother may ask, How can we the saved persons present our bodies?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When a question is raised, we can let every brother and sister take turns speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do not have to leave the answering to one man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Perhaps a young sister would begin, Brother, let me tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Previously, we were all busy for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our time and our bodies were fully occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now that we are saved and have come to love the Lord, Paul is exhorting us to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>According to my experience, to present our bodies is to present our time because our bodies are confined to our time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She only speaks a few sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The whole thing takes less than a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everybody hears it and is touched by it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps among those in the meeting, I have been in the Lord longer and have had more experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Yet, I will not assume my seniority and speak for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What I speak is just what the first sister spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I may say, She was absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To present our bodies is to present our time.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we do not present our time, our bodies cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>That is all I say.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I do not tell any story nor do I give a long sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everyone speaks a few simple sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The whole speaking takes only a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Perhaps another sister would ask again, How then do I present my body?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Does that mean that I don t work and don t teach but instead stay home and offer my body to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is a very practical question.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, I should still not take the lead to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I let the newly saved ones speak more.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Perhaps after a while, one who has been saved for only half a year says, When I read Romans 12, not only do I see the presenting of the body, I see the transformation and renewing of the mind as well.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, first there is the presenting of the body, and then there is the renewing and transforming of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Another one may not understand this too well.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He may ask, How then can the mind be renewed?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>A third one may say, According to my experience, to be transformed in the mind, we have to read the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we receive the Lord s word into us, the word itself will change our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is the transformation of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is a very good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some brothers and sisters may then ask, After the body is presented and the mind is transformed, what happens next?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I remember that I have read this passage before.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>And so I answer saying, In Romans 12, first you have the presenting of the body, and then you have the transformation of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Lastly, in verse 11, there is the burning in spirit to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When we speak in this way, everybody will understand and will be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This kind of small group meeting in which everyone speaks, everyone asks, everyone answers, everyone learns, and everyone teaches is surely living, fresh, rich, and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As a result, the number will surely increase.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The reason for this is that there is no formality in worship, and there is no set program or procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Everyone acts according to the Spirit, moves according to the Spirit, and serves according to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>All the brothers and sisters who attend this kind of meeting will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Every week throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should set aside an evening for this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>After a new one meets in this way for a year, he will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He will grow in life, and he will be able to serve by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Prophesying Being Mainly</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>for the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Not only do we bring the new ones to the small group meeting, but also, on the Lord s Day, we bring them to the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>After the breaking of the bread, they may see that so many brothers and sisters are prophesying, that is, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Some may prophesy for three minutes, some for two.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>After watching this for a few weeks, the new ones will feel attracted to it and may desire to prophesy also.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We will then help them along, first to prophesy in the small group meeting and then to prophesy in the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>In the end, everyone in the whole church will be able to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Both young and old will be able to speak for the Lord, and the riches of the Lord will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>All will be supplied, edified, and nourished, and the church as the Body of Christ will be built up through the prophesying by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This is what the Lord is after today.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Therefore, our way of meeting must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Our former way of meeting afforded no benefit to the Lord s economy and did not match the nature of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Now we have found out God s ordained way according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Every point of His ordained way matches the nature of God s New Testament economy, and meets the need of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>In the end, God s economy will be realized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>I hope that we will practice this together.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>May the Lord bless all of you.</S>
