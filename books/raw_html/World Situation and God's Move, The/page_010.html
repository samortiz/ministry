<p>When Britain saw that Russia had gained ports in the Far East, she influenced Japan to fight Russia. This agreed with Japanese interests, since Japan wanted the areas of China that Russia was controlling. Japan made an alliance with Great Britain in 1902, and war broke out in 1904. Japan defeated Russia and thus gained control of Korea. Russian troops had to withdraw from Manchuria. Japan was given Port Arthur and Dairen and took over the Russian rights in Manchuria.<p>The Japanese presence on the mainland led in 1931 to its invasion of Manchuria and eventually to the war in the Pacific. In 1932 the United States under President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson declared it would not recognize Japan’s territorial gains in Manchuria. In 1937 President Roosevelt also condemned Japanese aggression against China. In the fall of 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek met at Cairo for a conference to discuss the war and the postwar problems. When Roosevelt proposed getting rid of the Japanese emperor, Chiang Kai-shek advised against this, pointing out that the emperor was needed as a figurehead in order to keep the Japanese people under control. At the secret Yalta agreements in 1945 Roosevelt agreed to give Stalin Russia’s former rights in Manchuria, which Japan had taken over. These agreements were made without China’s knowledge.<p>Two months after the Yalta agreements, Roosevelt died. When Truman came into the Presidency, he was deeply concerned about bringing an end to the war. To hasten the end, he gave instructions that the atomic bomb be dropped on Japan. The emperor wanted to surrender immediately, but the generals held off. After the second bomb was dropped, the emperor unconditionally surrendered. On August 8, two days before Japan’s offer became public, Russia declared war on Japan and sent its army into Manchuria, not to defeat the Japanese but to take the surrender. Gradually with the help of Russia, China became a Communist country. The United States withdrew.<p>The two Communist countries, Russia and China, should have been friendly toward each other, but six or seven years after the Communist takeover of China they had a dispute over the territory of Siberia. This led to a break and an end to their friendship. This was the Lord’s sovereignty! If these two big Communist countries became one, it would be a menace to the entire world.<p>To be a significant power in the world today a nation must have a big territory and a big population. This is demonstrated by Japan’s attempt to take over China. Japan was a real power, with a navy, air force, and army. Even before they invaded, their learned ones warned them that it would be an impossible task. Japan was like a small snake; it could not swallow such a big prey! If they attempted it, their stomach would burst and they would die. Their statesmen urged them to be friendly toward China, rather than attack it. These wise words went unheeded. Japan first invaded North China, then Shanghai, then Nanking. In spite of all their forces, their bombings, their brutality toward the women, they were utterly unable to subdue so many millions of people.<p>Besides a large territory and a big population, natural resources and skills are also needed in order for a country to be powerful today. Only three nations have these four things: the United States, China, and Russia. Although China is backward in skills, it is making progress. Their nuclear science industry is developing. Their resources are rich, but underdeveloped. For this reason they need the United States. They need American money and skill to develop their iron, copper, silver, and coal mines. They need technology for working their oil fields.<p>The United States, Russia, and China are a strange triangle. Though two are Communist, they cannot work together. Russia is always opposed to the United States. In this three-angle struggle, Russia and the United States are competing. Who will gain the support of the third country? The United States will win China. The United States needs China to balance Russia; China needs the support of the United States to build the country.<p>Who can deal with this northern bear? Who can deal with Gog and Magog? God has been restricting this people who oppose Him. First He used Britain. Now He is using the present situation to restrict Russia.
