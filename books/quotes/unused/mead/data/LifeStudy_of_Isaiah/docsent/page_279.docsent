   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS FOUR STAGES ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 3 Scripture Reading: Isa 53:12a, 10c; Eph 4:8; Acts 2:36; Rev 17:14; 19:16; Eph 1:22b, 10-11; Acts 5:31; Rev 1:5a; Heb 4:14; 7:26; 8:1-2; 7:25; 4:15-16; Rev 1:13; 2:1b; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Tim 1:4b</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to the last verse of Isaiah 53.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have seen in the previous two messages, Isaiah 53 covers the four stages of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the whole universe Christ is the most wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such a One, Christ has four stages: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entire Bible of sixty-six books speaks mainly concerning these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing in the universe is as crucial as Christ's incarnation, Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we will see Christ in the stage of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Colossians 2:15 says that while Christ was hanging on the cross, the Father stripped off the rulers and authorities, the evil angelic powers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse opens a window to show us that while Christ was being crucified on the cross, a war was raging between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before that time Satan had induced a group of angels to rebel against God and to follow him and become his subordinates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians 2:2 Satan is called "the ruler of the authority of the air," indicating that under him are the rulers and authorities in the air, which are the evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, there was a war between the good angels and the evil angels, and even between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is clearly indicated by Colossians 2:15, which says, "Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The antecedent of the pronoun He in this verse is God in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we read only the four Gospels, we will not be able to see that during Christ's crucifixion a war was raging between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only Colossians 2:15 shows us such a scene.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to realize that in the universe there is an invisible scene behind the visible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the entire universe there are two scenes; one is visible, and the other is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ was crucified, there was a visible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the people standing there saw that visible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The soldiers put Christ on the cross and nailed His hands and His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then they erected the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The bystanders saw these things, but they could not see and they did not see that behind the visible scene there was an invisible scene: God and Satan were fighting there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this fighting God stripped off all the troublesome rulers and authorities, and He made a public show of them, triumphing over them in Christ and in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that in the whole universe only four things are crucial to God and to us, His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All other things are insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the books of the New Testament we can see the invisible scene behind the visible scene concerning Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This scene is continuing even today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Old Testament, in books such as Daniel, also shows that at that time there were both a visible scene and an invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the scene that was visible to people, Babylon came to capture Jerusalem Dan 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That captivity endured for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of those years the Medo-Persian Empire defeated Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these things were visible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But people could not see that behind that scene there was another, invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They could not see that behind Persia was the prince of Persia, and behind Greece was the prince of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Greece under Alexander was fighting against Persia, the two princes also were fighting in the air 10:13, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In each of the four steps of Christ, not only men but also angels were involved Luke 2:8-14; Col 2:15; Matt 28:2-7; Acts 1:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates again that concerning Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension there is both the visible scene and the invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, of these two, the invisible scene is more important.</S>
