   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OUTER MAN BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for a saved and regenerated believer to live out the Lord's life, there are two steps that he has to take.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is believing, which is receiving the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second is consecrating himself, which means committing his outer man to the Lord to allow the new life within to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like a property consisting of a house and a plot of land around the house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can assume that the house is the inner man and the plot around the house is the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the house belongs to a person, but the plot of land does not, there will be trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consequently, as soon as a man believes, he should consecrate himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consecration is committing one's outer man to the Lord so that it will belong to the Lord in the same way that the inner man belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many believers today are neither in nor out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you ask if they are saved, they answer yes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are saved, but their outer man has never been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their inner life is frustrated from being expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we must not just believe in the Lord, stopping at salvation and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must also consecrate our outer man to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man is willing to consecrate his mind, emotion, and will to the Lord in an absolute way, he will live out the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem today is that many have consecrated themselves, yet their consecration is not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They consecrate according to their own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They consecrate only when they want to, and they do not consecrate when they do not want to.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most people live in their mind and emotion, living for the satisfaction of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many communicate with the Lord through their mind and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Few communicate with the Lord according to their will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can find many Christians who love the doctrines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When someone expounds Matthew 24 or Revelation well, they love to flock around and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not take much effort to listen to a message and no price is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After they hear a good message, they happily return home, but nothing further happens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are others who are very strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are always actively working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, they are better than the ones without emotion, but they are so unstable that they are like the waves of the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may zealously prepare a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After delivering the sermon, they may secretly consider in their heart how successful they were, how the people were touched, and how the audience was persuaded.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may be so overjoyed that they cannot sleep that night.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most people cannot go to sleep because of pain; but these cannot go to sleep because of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They gratify themselves with the activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although they are serving the Lord outwardly, in reality they are gratifying themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have not committed their will fully to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must consecrate their will absolutely to the Lord and be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before they can render genuine service to the Lord, they must also allow Him to control their mind and emotion so that they will not act according to their active mind or according to the impulse of their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CONDITIONS FOR KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not like to hear people asking how to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every one of us should already be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's will is revealed only to those who have consecrated their will to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not force us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is always waiting for us to become willing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not matter much if a person knows God's will; it is more important that a person be willing to choose God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to say to the Lord, "Not according to my will, but according to Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we lay down our selves, we will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once in a sisters' meeting in Hangchow, two sisters asked me if God's will is based upon circumstance, upon the Bible, or upon other principles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I heard this, my heart sank, and I answered in a harsh way although my heart was not harsh , saying, "Knowing God's will is not a matter of method.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may have the right methods, and you may act faithfully according to these methods step by step, but you will still not know God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As I was speaking, my eyes were fixed on the two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I then asked, "What kind of persons are you?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person's knowledge of God's will has to do with that person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a person is not right, no method will work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Can God reveal His will to persons like you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You do not have to ask many questions, and you do not have to ask God for methods.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God can reveal His will in many ways; He can reveal it through the wind, the thunder, a child, or a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You only need to ask whether persons like you are qualified to know God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Genesis 18 when God was about to destroy the city of Sodom, He came to Abraham because He could not hide this matter from him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abraham was a friend of God James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was not a slave of God, because a slave does not know the mind of the master; only a friend knows the mind of a friend John 15:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was no barrier between Abraham and God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why God could not hide what He was about to do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Lot was Abraham's relative; he might have had a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but God did not speak with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He only told Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It would be a joke if Lot came to me and asked, "How can I know God's will?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Abraham was qualified to know God's will, but Lot was not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It would be useless even if Lot had all the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lot was still Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Are you Abraham or are you Lot?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people today pay attention to the method of knowing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is a need of learning the methods, but one must be an Abraham to learn the methods.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a Lot is learning them, the best methods will not work because he is a person living in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has not dealt with the world and his position.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today we must apply God's light to see if there are sins in us, great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Have we committed any unrighteousnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do we owe anyone anything?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Have we been loose in our conduct or wrong in our words, gestures, and attitudes?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Are we still holding on to something?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All of these big and small sins affect our ability to know God's will.</S>
