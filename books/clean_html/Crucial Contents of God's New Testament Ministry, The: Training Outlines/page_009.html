<h1 class="title">God&rsquo;s Complete Salvation&mdash;<br />
Judicial Redemption plus Organic Salvation</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s complete salvation is of two aspects&mdash;the judicial aspect and the organic aspect:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s judicial redemption is the judicial aspect of God&rsquo;s complete salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is according to the righteousness of God&mdash;Rom. 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31.</li>
		<li>It is through God&rsquo;s fulfilling of all the requirements of His righteous law on sinners by Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross&mdash;Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:12.</li>
		<li>It was accomplished in the physical realm of Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry by the Christ in the flesh.</li>
		<li>It results objectively in God&rsquo;s:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Forgiveness of the believers&rsquo; sins&mdash;Luke 24:47; Eph. 1:7.</li>
			<li>Washing away the believers&rsquo; sins&mdash;Heb. 1:3.</li>
			<li>Justifying the believers&mdash;Rom. 3:24-25.</li>
			<li>Reconciling the believers who were His enemies to Himself&mdash;Rom. 5:10a.</li>
			<li>Sanctifying the believers in their position unto Himself as His holy people&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 13:12; 10:29.</li>
			<li>Thereby qualifying and positioning the believers to enter into the grace of God for the accomplishment of the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s judicial redemption is the procedure of God&rsquo;s complete salvation for the believers to participate in God&rsquo;s organic salvation as the purpose of the complete salvation of God&mdash;Rom. 5:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the organic aspect of God&rsquo;s complete salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is through the life of God&mdash;Rom. 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b.</li>
		<li>As the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation, it accomplishes all that God wants to achieve in the believers in His economy through His divine life.</li>
		<li>It results subjectively in the believers&rsquo; regeneration, feeding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification.</li>
		<li>All of the items of God&rsquo;s organic salvation are carried out not by the Christ in the flesh in His earthly ministry judicially and objectively but by the Christ as the life-giving Spirit in His heavenly ministry organically and subjectively.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s organic salvation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Regeneration is the propagation of the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Regeneration is the center of God&rsquo;s entire salvation and the commencement of God&rsquo;s salvation in its organic aspect.</li>
		<li>It is to regenerate and re-create the redeemed believers in their spirit by the Spirit of God&mdash;John 3:6b.</li>
		<li>It is through the resurrection of Christ that He may impart His life into them as the authority for them to be the children of God, begotten of God as His species&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13.</li>
		<li>Through regeneration the believers have the eternal, divine life of God in addition to their natural, human life&mdash;John 3:15, 36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Feeding in shepherding is the nourishment of the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Feeding is the continuation of regeneration through Christ&rsquo;s shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity&mdash;Eph. 5:29; John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25.</li>
		<li>Feeding nourishes His newborn babes (new believers) that they may grow and be saved gradually through the supply of the milk in the word of God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2.</li>
		<li>Feeding supplies His growing believers with the solid word, which is the Spirit of life&mdash;Heb. 5:14; John 6:63.</li>
		<li>Feeding results in the believers&rsquo; maturity in the divine life unto transformation and conformation to the image of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2; 8:29.</li>
		<li>Feeding is also by the believers through the mutual shepherding for the building up of the Body of Christ for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and the achievement of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16; John 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 5:2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Dispositional sanctification constitutes the believers with God&rsquo;s divine nature:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is an inward sanctifying of the believers who are growing in the divine life by the working of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life, in their disposition&mdash;Rom. 15:16; 8:2.</li>
		<li>The believers are sanctified with the divine, holy nature of God for them to be holy unto God and thus fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose in choosing us&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Eph. 1:4.</li>
		<li>Dispositional sanctification implies transformation&mdash;Rom. 6:19, 22.</li>
		<li>Sanctification will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the holy city&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Renewing is the process of God&rsquo;s new creation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers are spontaneously renewed in their spiritual life when they are sanctified by the Holy Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>Renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration (Titus 3:5) and is based upon the ongoing process of sanctification, making the believers new.</li>
		<li>It is carried out:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By the renewing Spirit mingling with the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ as one spirit to spread into the believers&rsquo; mind to renew their entire being as a member of the new man&mdash;Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23.</li>
			<li>By the believers&rsquo; walking in the newness of life in resurrection&mdash;Rom. 6:4; Eph. 4:22-24; Phil. 1:19-21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>It is through the consuming by the believers&rsquo; environmental sufferings&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		<li>The believers must be thoroughly and absolutely renewed that they may be practically the genuine new creation of God and for God&mdash;Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>Renewing causes the believers to be new as the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Transformation is the metabolic process in the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This process transforms the believers&rsquo; entire being, beginning from the renewing of the mind, that they may fully participate in God&rsquo;s divinity&mdash;Rom. 12:2b.</li>
		<li>It is not any kind of outward correction or adjustment but a kind of metabolism, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into their being, to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ.</li>
		<li>It is accomplished by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) transforming the believers into the image of the glory of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate them and transform them into the image of the Lord in glory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Building up is the joining and knitting together in the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s building is brought forth through the joining and knitting together by the working of the transforming Spirit on the believers&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
		<li>It is the issue of the believers&rsquo; growing into the Head, Christ, in all things&mdash;Eph. 4:15.</li>
		<li>This is the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the building of the holy city, New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 3:12; 21:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Conformation is the maturity in the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Conformation is the consummation of the believers&rsquo; regeneration, feeding, sanctification, renewing, and transformation in the divine life&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>Conformation is when the believers have matured in the divine life by the maturing Spirit in their spirit to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&mdash;Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13.</li>
		<li>Conformation is to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a; 1 John 3:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Glorification is the full manifestation of God&rsquo;s complete salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In regeneration God seals the regenerated believers with His Spirit unto the day of redemption&mdash;Eph. 1:13; 4:30.</li>
		<li>The matured believers will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through their being brought into God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Eph. 4:30; 2 Thes. 1:10; Rom. 8:23, 30; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		<li>The glorification of the matured believers is the top portion of their divine sonship in God&rsquo;s organic salvation, which they received at the time of their regeneration&mdash;Gal. 4:5; Rom. 8:23.</li>
		<li>The redemption of the believers&rsquo; body is the transfiguration of their body at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;Phil. 3:20-21.</li>
		<li>Through glorification God realizes the fulfillment of His eternal purpose&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;the crystallization of the union and mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</li>
