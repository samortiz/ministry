   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RUN THE RACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter twelve shows us that we should lay aside every weight and run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you fall while running the race, you should simply rise to your feet and continue running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no need to go back to the beginning, but just to begin where you fell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No runner who falls down while in a race would be so stupid as to go back to the beginning and start over.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, he would get up from the point where he falls and continue to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians, though, do this very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every year at the time of revival, they go back to the beginning and repent once more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need for them to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They just need to rise up from where they have fallen and run the race for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we will not be obedient to the Lord and go on, we have to realize that our God is a consuming fire 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we refuse to take grace and go on, surely God will one day exercise some judgment upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean we will be lost, but it does mean we will suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to see that we have such a wonderful Christ who is superior to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is superior to the angels, to Moses and Joshua, to Aaron and the priests, and to the Old Covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, we have such a prevailing way to go on the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to go on to enjoy Christ and to take the overcoming way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, we will have the full enjoyment of Christ which will consummate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we do not go on to enjoy Christ in such a wonderful way, we will miss something, and we will suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these points in Hebrews are the development of the seeds sown in the book of Matthew concerning the kingdom.</S>
