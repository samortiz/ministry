<h2 class=head2>Shepherding the Flock of God</h2><p>If we would drop the concept concerning rank, it would be easy for us to understand the matter of position. If rank is gone, the position means nothing. Actually, I would say, strictly speaking, that the elders should not consider that they have any position. They have no position. The Apostle Peter could not forget the Lord’s teaching concerning this matter. In his first Epistle Peter told the elders as a “fellow-elder” (5:1) not to lord it over the brothers and the sisters but to be a living example, a pattern (v. 3).<p>According to the actual situation of a shepherd and a flock, the shepherd, strictly speaking, cannot be an example to the flock. The shepherd is a man and the flock is cattle. How can a man be an example to cattle? Actually, though, the flock as the church is a composition of men. The saints are not cattle, but they are men just as the elders are men. The elders are men, but they are also the shepherds. They should not shepherd a flock of men as they would a flock of cattle. The elders have to shepherd the “man flock” by setting themselves up, the living men, as examples. Whatever the saints in the local church should do or live, the elders must do it and live it first. Then their doing and their living will be a living example. This is the way to shepherd. According to this way, the elders do not have a rank nor do they have a position. If they do have a position, their position is the same as all the saints.<p>In God’s economy, the shepherd and the flock all are men and all of them should be the same because the shepherd should be an example. If the shepherds, the elders, are extraordinary, different people, they could never be examples to others. Since they can be examples to others, they are the same as others. For instance, we cannot say that the king should be an example to the civilians. We also cannot say that the governor of a state should be an example to the citizens of this state. However, Peter says as an elder that all the elders should be living examples of the flock.<h2 class=head2>No Control</h2><p>Also, according to the Lord’s word in the Gospels and to Peter’s words in his Epistle, the holy Word does not allow the elder to control at all. The Lord Jesus stressed this point very strongly. The leading ones should not be rulers, but slaves, servants, who serve and who do not control. Then Peter tells the elders not to lord it over the believers. The church does not belong to the elders, but the church is God’s flock. An elder is a shepherd and a servant to take care of the owner’s flock, and the owner is God Himself. In 1 Peter 5:3, Peter tells the elders not to lord it over the “allotments.” This Greek word means lots or portions. The churches are God’s possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care. God is the Owner and the Master and the elders are His servants to serve Him and take care of His assignment. The Master has assigned the local church to the elders who should take care of the flock, not by ruling but by serving as a slave, setting themselves up as living examples.<p>According to the New Testament teaching, there is no rank and no position for the elders. There is also no controlling for the elders because they do not have any rank or any position. They do not have any right to control. The clear word of the New Testament does not allow or give any ground for the elders to take rank, position, or controlling power.
