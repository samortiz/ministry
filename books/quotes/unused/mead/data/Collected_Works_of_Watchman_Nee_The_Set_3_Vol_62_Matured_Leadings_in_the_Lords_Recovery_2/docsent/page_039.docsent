   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have said that the brothers and sisters should beware that they do not build up any friendship outside the love of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In doing something, we may come across some knowledge of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Other than trying to understand what we need to know, we must avoid trying to know too much about the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if you do know something, you should not tell others about it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man has a lust to know and to probe into other people's business.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, we may see two brothers talking to each other, and within us there is an urge to eavesdrop.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This lust must be dealt with strictly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to remember that the Lord Jesus' Spirit knows everything that goes on in man's heart Mark 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the book of Isaiah tells us that he is a blind and deaf servant 42:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord seemed to be ignorant about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, Judas was a thief, yet the Lord asked him to take charge of the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to learn from our Lord's example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should only pick up knowledge of other people's business under the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man has a craving to know others' business, he is a very fallen man indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, the responsible ones should not lightly talk about the spiritual strengths or weaknesses of others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to learn to speak under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our speaking has to be discreet, and we have to be in fear and trembling when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unless God measures the knowledge of the saints' problems to us, we should not probe into them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not scheme to know the brothers' and sisters' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if they reveal their secrets to us, we should keep this information secret.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must all learn to speak under the restriction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These rules should be adhered to closely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE ADVANTAGES OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Watchman Nee:The most intimate kind of fellowship is the fellowship in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, there is much profit to the saints opening up their homes for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The responsible ones in a district should set a good example for the other brothers and sisters to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Timothy and Silas reached Paul, he was constrained by the word Acts 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, Paul went to Troas for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he did not find Titus, he had no rest in his spirit, and taking leave of them he went forth into Macedonia 2 Cor 2:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul had intimate fellowship with Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Paul did not see him, he had no rest in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians do not necessarily have to communicate their problems with each other through words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times because of intimate fellowship, they are able to touch each others' condition in their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers and sisters are reluctant to obey the Lord and forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But through fellowship their problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not our ability that solves the problems but the flow of God's life through fellowship that spontaneously washes others' feet, renews and invigorates them, and solves their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meals among the brothers and sisters cannot be an ordinary meal together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They must be a kind of agape as described in Jude 12.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That word can be translated as "love feast."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the original language, there is only the word love, not feast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in the eating that the love is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the early churches, the believers often took meals together for the sake of fellowshipping and worshipping together in love Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such feasts were often linked to the Lord's supper 1 Cor 11:20-21, 33 ; they were called the agape.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, when we come together to eat, we express our mutual love one for the other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We break bread together for mutual fellowship; this is our communion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the meaning of our breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord never charged individuals to break bread by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He gave this commandment where at least three or five people are gathered together cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Luke 22:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The breaking of bread is for remembering the Lord on the one hand and for fellowship among the believers on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>SUPPLYING OTHERS WITH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not too hard for the leading brothers to lead the saints with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the feeling within each person's spirit varies, you have to learn to touch the feeling within man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers and sisters may be depressed or elated in their spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The degree of depression and elation may be different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In fellowshipping with them, you have to have some spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>With discernment you will render them some practical spiritual supply in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Man's real need is the supply of life, not zealous words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A man cannot be zealous all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The responsible ones have to be sensitive in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They have to feel what the brothers and sisters feel.</S>
