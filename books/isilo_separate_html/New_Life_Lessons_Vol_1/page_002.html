<p>We are God&rsquo;s children. The salvation which we received from the Lord is precious and secure. This salvation was received at the moment we believed, and it will never be lost. Once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. KNOWING THAT YOU ARE SAVED</h2>
<h2 class="head1">BY BELIEVING</h2>
<p>John 6:47 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">BY CALLING</h2>
<p>Romans 10:13 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">BY BEING BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>Mark 16:16 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Since you have <strong>believed, called,</strong> and been <strong>baptized,</strong> by the Word of God you can <strong>know</strong> assuredly that you are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Not only can we know about our salvation, but we can be assured of it as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* SAVED AT THE MOMENT WE BELIEVED</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:24</p>
<h2 class="head2">* WE CAN KNOW THAT WE ARE SAVED</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 5:13</p>
<h2 class="head2">* HOW TO KNOW THAT WE ARE SAVED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. THE INNER WITNESS&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 8:16</p>
<p>No wonder that when we call our God &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; we feel so natural and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 4:6</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. THE OUTER WITNESS&mdash;<br />
THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.&rdquo;</strong>   1 John 5:13</p>
<p>The words of the Bible are the title deed of our eternal salvation. They are our guarantee and surety. This is like buying a house. After you make your payment you obtain the &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; and the house is yours. It is not a matter of feeling or opinion, but an accomplished fact.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. THE PROOF OF<br />
THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>(1) Loving the brothers</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 3:14</p>
<p>(2) Feeling sorry about our sins</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 2:1</p>
<p>It is possible for regenerated believers to sin if they do not live by the divine life. When we sin, our fellowship with God is broken, and we will feel darkened, uneasy, and sorry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SECURITY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Our salvation is secure, because this salvation is safeguarded by:</p>
<p>1. THE LOVE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.&rdquo;</strong>   John 13:1</p>
<p>The love with which God loves us is an eternal love; it is a love that loves us to the uttermost. It will not cease regardless of our condition.</p>
<p>2. THE POWER OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.&rdquo;</strong>   John 10:28</p>
<p>The hand of God is a mighty hand. It will keep us from falling.</p>
<p>3. THE REDEMPTION OF CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 7:25</p>
<p>The Lord lives forever, and He will save us to the uttermost. After we are saved, although our feeling and condition may change, the fact and position of our salvation will never change. Once we are saved we are <strong>eternally saved, eternally perfected, and will not perish eternally.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT OF SALVATION&mdash;<br />
CLEARANCE OF THE PAST</h2>
<p>After a believer is saved, he should spontaneously terminate the things of the past. This is the practice of a believer who is clearly saved.</p>
<p>1. FORSAKING THE IDOLS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Thessalonians 1:9</p>
<p>Any idols or things related to idols must be thoroughly dealt with.</p>
<p>2. DESTROYING THE EVIL AND<br />
DEMONIC THINGS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all.&rdquo;</strong>   Acts 19:19</p>
<p>All inappropriate items and improper books, pictures, and apparatuses should be properly dealt with.</p>
<p>3. RESTORING TO OTHERS WHAT WE OWE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much.&rdquo;</strong>   Luke 19:8</p>
<p>Whatever we have obtained by way of extortion, cheating, stealing, or any other improper means must be returned or dealt with.</p>
<p>4. TERMINATING THE OLD WAY OF LIFE</p>
<p>We must pray to the Lord concerning our past conduct, behavior, and way of living. Anything that does not correspond to the grace of our calling, or anything that is not fitting for saints, should be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.&rdquo;</strong>   Ephesians 4:1</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that at the start of your new life you can know clearly that you are definitely saved and be led to have a clear termination of your past so that you can have an entirely new living.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
