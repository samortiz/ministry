<p>The most crucial matter in a scientific approach is to conduct thorough research. We should do research from a number of perspectives to obtain statistics. From the statistics we can determine an appropriate and scientific method. With regard to the way we preach the gospel, everything needs to be improved. The ideal way for us to improve our preaching of the gospel is to use videotapes and even television. It would be wonderful if every household on the island of Taiwan could watch the church preaching the gospel and hear people say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; All the activities of the church need to be recorded on videotape and made available on television. Even if people do not want to receive the gospel, when they turn on their television, they would hear us sing, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart.&rdquo; If they switch to another station, they would again hear us sing, &ldquo;Vanity, vanity...all things are vain, Christ only is gain!&rdquo; If they switch to a third station, they would hear, &ldquo;You need Jesus, you need Jesus.&rdquo; They would be pressed by the gospel. All these scenarios are not only a dream. I hope that we will see the day when every household that turns on the television will hear programs concerning the gospel, Jesus, and the church. The sound of Hallelujah and Amen should fill the air.</p>
<p>Whether such a scenario will materialize and whether we can carry it out depend on our research. Today Chinese operas and folk operas are available on television. Surely we do not want to imitate others, but we need to research how to preach the gospel. We should not use the old method of pulling an ox cart. The co-workers need to rise up to consider how the work should improve. We should consider and evaluate whether we should videotape the activities of the church and put them on television. We hope that one day the messages given in the morning will be aired the evening of the same day and viewed by every household on the island of Taiwan. We also hope that the faces of the brothers and sisters in the meetings can be seen on television.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Sticking to the Old Ways but Improving</h2>
<p>Our inherent problem is that the serving ones have not progressed. Even commercial packaging has made improvements, but we are still using methods from thirty-five years ago for the sake of saving money. We should progress and change our concepts. We may want to save money, but in fact, we are losing money. In recent years businesses have invested a large amount of money in packaging. For example, in Japan they package merchandise with layers of paper. The outer layers are fancier, and the last layer has a pretty bow. This shows what Japanese businesses are willing to do to entice customers.</p>
<p>This illustration is used mainly to give us a deep impression. This is not a reprimand. We need to see that we have suffered a loss because we would rather stay with the old ways than advance. The attitude of the government in Taiwan has always been reform, which has brought in much success. The Chinese people are intelligent and capable and can succeed as long as they drop the attitude of sticking to the old ways. These examples may seem to deviate from our burden, but the principle is the same. We should not stick to the old ways, but rather, we should seek to improve our ways.</p>
<p>The Lord has richly blessed us in Taiwan. The environment is good, the church is blessed, and there is a large number of saints. It is regrettable that we hold on to our old ways. To further illustrate, the frame of my front door is made of wood, and a section of it needed to be repaired. Many American brothers know how to fix things, and they often told me that if anything in my house needs repair, I should let them know. So I told them about the doorframe. According to my Chinese way of thinking, the only need was to repair the damaged section of the doorframe, but the American way was to replace the entire doorframe with a new one. This was inexpensive and did not take long to do. However, it would have taken much longer and been more expensive to repair only the damaged section of the doorframe. The American brothers did this according to the American logic, the American economics. The Chinese logic, the Chinese economics, is to save money by repairing only the damaged portion of the doorframe. I did not know that it is not easy to repair a doorframe, because wood must be found that matches the color of the original doorframe, which is a troublesome task. This example shows us two kinds of logic, two ways of thinking. One belongs to the new era, and the other belongs to the old.</p>
<p>The church needs to keep up with the new era. The bound volumes of the Life-studies of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are a proof of a change in our style. The printing, design, and binding of the Life-studies are of top quality. Before we went to print, we gathered samples of all the hardbound books on the market that were nicely done. The size of the Life-studies is larger than most books on the market. Every volume can be opened flat, which is not a small thing in a hardbound book. We spent much effort to research and print a good quality book. In the past it was difficult to locate a bookbinder in Taiwan who could meet our standard. It is different now. Many bookbinders have improved their skills.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
