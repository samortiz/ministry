PRODUCING THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Modern Technology Joining<br />
the Nations on the Earth Together</h2>
<p>We must see God&rsquo;s move in the universe from the perspective of world history. The United States was the first country that was not founded based on a single race; it is a united country with many different ethnicities. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is for the manifestation of the one new man. Therefore, we believe that all the political changes on the earth are under God&rsquo;s sovereignty for the fulfillment of His purpose.</p>
<p>After World War II the United States became the leading power in the world. The United States dominates the international realm in culture, politics, science, medicine, mathematics, and many other areas. Furthermore, the nations on the earth are no longer isolated. People travel everywhere in the world. Airports are filled with people. In the past there were few Chinese in the United States, but now there are at least two million Chinese; this is roughly one percent of the population of two hundred million in the United States. In other words, there is one Chinese for every one hundred people in the United States. This is not a small matter; it shows that the Americans and Chinese are blended.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, it took six months for American missionaries to sail to China. Some missionaries suffered greatly from seasickness during that rough journey. Some died immediately after they reached China and were buried in China. When I was young, my family had contact with American missionaries, so I understand the hardships they experienced. At that time, traveling was not convenient. It took a year for a round trip between the United States and China. Transportation has advanced today. Within forty-eight hours, people can fly from China to the United States on a 747 airplane for business and return home safely. Furthermore, communication is very convenient. People can contact one another by telegram and telephone. There are also different kinds of audio and video equipment. All these things enhance communication among people and blend together people from all over the world. Although there are still distinctions in nationalities, no one can deny that this is an age of blending all the nations in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The International Political Situation<br />
Being for the Producing of the One New Man</h2>
<p>On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered. On September 2 Japan signed an official surrender, and World War II ended. In early September the Truman administration of the United States informed the Chinese government that the United States, Britain, and Russia had made an agreement at Yalta the previous February. This agreement allowed Stalin to gain territory in the northeast of China that had been taken by Japan. This agreement contradicted the interests of China. At that time I was recuperating from an illness in Tsingtao. When I heard this news, I was upset and grieved because I was clear that in order for the Lord&rsquo;s gospel to have a free way on the earth, there must be the covering of a proper government. Any political change in China would deal a heavy blow to the propagation of the churches. I was concerned about this.</p>
<p>In 1949 I was sent by Brother Watchman Nee to Taiwan because of the urgency of the political situation in China. At that time Taiwan was underdeveloped; it had pebble roads, and people wore clogs. When we were in China, Brother Nee took the lead in the work. By 1949 there were hundreds of local churches in thirty-three provinces and major cities. The Lord&rsquo;s work in China was prevailing, but due to the political change, I came to Taiwan. Every day I would lie depressed on my bed, staring at the ceiling and asking the Lord, &ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo; I was frustrated. One day the Lord gave me the feeling to travel by train from station to station in order to visit the saints who had come from China. After this trip I became clear within that there was work to be done in Taiwan. Then I received the burden from the Lord to start the work on August 1, 1949.</p>
<p>Before the Lord returns, there will always be conflicts between nations. However, no country or nation can close its door and isolate itself; it must communicate with other nations. The different forms of communication benefit the preaching of the gospel and the producing of the one new man. The Lord planted a gospel nursery in mainland China. After 1949 the Lord moved this nursery to Taiwan, and from Taiwan He moved it to all the continents. In the first issue of <em>The Ministry of the Word,</em> published in 1951, there is a portion entitled &ldquo;Concerning Our Coming to Taiwan,&rdquo; which states that it was the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure to bring us to Taiwan. Taiwan is connected to Southeast Asia and to Northeast Asia. If we take Taiwan as the center, one day the Lord will spread His testimony to Southeast Asia and to Northeast Asia. In 1951 we did not think of the West. Today we thank and praise the Lord that not only are Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia connected to Taiwan, but even the West is connected to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to communicate with saints from different continents, because we are members of the same Body and share the same life. We are the one new man. On the one hand, we should be good, lawful, and loyal citizens in our respective countries. On the other hand, we are of one Body, we share the same life in the spirit, and we are the one new man.</p>
<p>I have been to many places. Hence, I can testify that I do not feel strange in Australia, New Zealand, South America, Japan, or Korea, because wherever I go, I am with my family&mdash;those who are of the same Body and share the same life with me. Our view should not be narrow or small. We should not think that it is sufficient to be saved, love the Lord, visit the saints, serve the Lord, and make the church prosper and flourish. Our view must be uplifted and enlarged to a universal view. Then we will know what the Lord is doing on the earth today. Whether in world politics or in international affairs, the Lord is working. If the Lord has uplifted and enlarged our view, we will see that all things are for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<p>The present means of communication between countries make it possible for all races to communicate with and know one another. The Lord&rsquo;s leading in the truth in His recovery has reached the stage where we see that the Lord is after the one new man on the earth. We can no longer be believers with a narrow view. Instead, we must see that we are part of the universal one new man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
