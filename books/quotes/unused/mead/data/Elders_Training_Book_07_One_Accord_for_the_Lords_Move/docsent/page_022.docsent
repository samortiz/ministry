   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BE WISE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was working with Brother Nee in mainland China, I never considered myself as anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I only considered myself as a co-worker to carry out Brother Nee s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I did my best not to preach any gospel not preached by him and not to give any message never given by him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I did my best not to use any terminology or eloquence for the preaching, the speaking, the teaching, which he never used.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I must declare and praise the Lord that I have received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I never regret what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one ever heard one thing out of my mouth concerning Brother Nee in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am still so grateful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without him, without his ministry, I could never be here like I am.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I only labored, I only worked, and I never caused any problem to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just before the government in mainland China was about to be changed to Communism, Brother Nee proposed an urgent conference of the leading co-workers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He fellowshipped with us concerning how we were going to face the coming situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He proposed to send me out of mainland China to go abroad, and he said that he and the others would sacrifice themselves in mainland China for the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I did not feel good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seemed to me that I was a dropout and that everyone would stay but me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord s work, yet I would be asked to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could never forget the look on Brother Nee s face when he turned to look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told me that we should be desperate and even willing to sacrifice ourselves for the Lord s move and that he realized there was much possibility that one day the enemy would wipe us out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He told me that in case we were wiped out, I had to go out so that we would still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then I said that I would take his word and go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Out of the many co-workers, I was the only one designated by him to go out in case we would be wiped out, so that we would still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever Brother Nee said was all fulfilled and has become history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise Him we still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We brothers must realize that we are not doing any work of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are not doing your work and neither am I doing my work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are all doing a unique work for the Lord s unique recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are over six hundred churches on this globe and not one is in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The leading ones in Anaheim can testify that I do not even know their meeting schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I want to attend the Lord s table I need to make a phone call to find out where I should go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever churches I have built up have all gone into others pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should realize that we are not doing a work for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are doing a work for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how much people have criticized Brother Nee, he was more than faithful to what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He surely worked for the Lord s recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am continuing to build up the Lord s recovery and I am doing the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that all of you would be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not think about being somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all are nobody!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only Christ has a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do feel that my frank word should make the entire situation clear to all of you and make the need clear to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need a fighting army and in the fighting army we do not merely need a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need a commander to fight the battle!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have any time to waste.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord s recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You also have to be faithful to so many who were influenced by you; otherwise, you are cheating them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be faithful to our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are serving Him and we mean business.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not just doing a job to feed ourselves, to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you want to make a living, do not stay in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Go to another and better field for you to make a better living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must mean business with the Lord, with the saints, and with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the only way for us to go on in the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now you know where I am and where you should be.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also, you know what all of us should do go to fight as an army and in the army.</S>
