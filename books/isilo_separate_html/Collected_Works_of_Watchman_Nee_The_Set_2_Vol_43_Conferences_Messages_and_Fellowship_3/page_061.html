Ephesians 4:32 speaks of a forgiveness that comes from Christ. John 20:22-23 speaks of a forgiveness that is related to the authority of the church; the church has authority to forgive men. This forgiveness is different from the forgiveness of Christ. First John 1:9 shows us that when a man confesses his sin before the Lord, he is forgiven. James 5:15, however, speaks of a special kind of forgiveness in which a sick brother should ask the elders to anoint him with oil. His sickness will then be healed, and his sins will be forgiven. Finally, Matthew 6:14-15 says that if we forgive others' offenses, our Father will also forgive our offenses, and if we do not forgive others' offenses, our Father will also not forgive our offenses.</p><p>In the Bible, there is more than one kind of forgiveness. In fact, there are at least five kinds of forgiveness. These five kinds of forgiveness are: (1) eternal forgiveness&mdash;this relates to the matter of life; (2) instrumental forgiveness&mdash;this relates to the church; (3) restorative forgiveness&mdash;this relates to fellowship; (4) governmental forgiveness&mdash;this relates to discipline; and (5) kingdom forgiveness&mdash;this relates to administration. I have made up these five expressions for ease of reference.</p><h2 class="head1">ETERNAL FORGIVENESS</h2><p>Eternal forgiveness refers to God forgiving our sins through Christ. Once we are forgiven, we are forgiven forever. We receive eternal life forever, and we are justified forever. All of our sins before God are forgiven. In order to receive this forgiveness, we have to believe in the Lord. Once we believe in Him, we are immediately forgiven. This does not come about through man's work but through the work of the Lord's cross. The Lord's blood, which was shed on the cross, has dealt with all our sins. Exodus 12 tells us that the Israelites slaughtered the lamb at the Passover and put the blood of the lamb on the doorpost and side posts. When God saw the blood, He passed over the house immediately. The blood of Christ guarantees that we will not perish, because His blood has satisfied God's righteous requirement according to the law. The blood speaks of the price of sin. Once sin encounters the blood, we find forgiveness, and our sins before God are washed away. When a man's sins are judged, his sins before God are thoroughly removed.</p><h2 class="head1">INSTRUMENTAL FORGIVENESS</h2><p>On the night of the Lord's resurrection, He breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit. After the Lord resurrected, He gave the Holy Spirit to the disciples and told them that they had the authority to forgive or to retain others' sins (John 20:22-23). Only after a man has received the Holy Spirit will he have the authority to forgive or retain others' sins. Why did the Lord say that the disciples and the church have authority to forgive men's sins? This forgiveness is an indirect forgiveness. God forgives men directly, and He also forgives men indirectly through other men. Our forgiveness before God is based on Christ. But here is an institution on earth&mdash;the church, the house of God. A person's sins may be forgiven, but he must still go through the judgment of the church. If his sins are considered as forgiven, he can be baptized. But if they are not considered as forgiven, then he cannot be baptized. When the church comes together to break bread and someone walks in, he may be a saved person, but the worker or the church must judge whether he is partaking of the flesh and blood in the Lord's name. If such a one is not a Christian according to our opinion, we should not receive him, because he is not one of us and has nothing to do with the Body of Christ.</p><p>If a church is short of the power and leading of the Holy Spirit, it surely will run into errors. But if a church has the leading, the power, and the authority of the Holy Spirit, it can forgive men's sins, and God will honor such forgiveness. If the church retains men's sins, God will also honor such retaining. This is God forgiving through men's forgiving. But only those who have the power of the Holy Spirit can have the authority to forgive. God wants man to declare His forgiveness on earth. The church, the workers of God, and the apostles are the representatives of God on earth today. God declares man's forgiveness through such people. This is not to say that a man has any authority in himself. The church cannot forgive men. But the church can ascertain whether or not a man's sins are forgiven through the power of the Holy Spirit. God forgives through the hand of man. Eternal forgiveness has to do with life. As soon as a person is forgiven, he is regenerated. But instrumental forgiveness is related to a corporate entity, the church. It is the church that determines whether or not a man is qualified to be a part of it.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
