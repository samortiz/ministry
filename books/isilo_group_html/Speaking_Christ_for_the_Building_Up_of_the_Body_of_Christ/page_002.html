<h1 class="title">THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 6:10; 2 Cor. 4:13; Acts 4:31; 1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16b</h1>
<p>Our fellowship in this book may be considered as a continuation of our fellowship from the winter training of 1987, which is contained in the book entitled <em>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ.</em> In this book we want to see more concerning this scriptural way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR BASIC FACTORS AND ELEMENTS<br />
IN OUR MEETINGS&mdash;<br />
THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, PRAYING, AND SINGING</h2>
<p>We need to learn how to practice all kinds of meetings: the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the larger meetings of the church. In all of our meetings there should be four basic factors and elements: the word, the spirit, praying, and singing. If we handle these four elements in a proper and living way, there will be a rich display and expression of Christ in all of our meetings.</p>
<p>The word is the holy word revealed in the Scriptures, either the constant Word or the instant word. If we are going to be the speaking ones in our meetings, we must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). The riches of Christ are in His word. The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us that it may operate and minister these riches into our being. Then our speaking of the word in the meetings will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>When we refer to the spirit, we are following the Apostle Paul to denote our spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. According to the New Testament, the divine Spirit and our human spirit are mingled together as one spirit. He that is joined to the Lord, who is the Spirit, is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:17). In a regenerated person, the divine Spirit and the human spirit are no longer two separate spirits. The Spirit of the Lord and the spirit as our inward being are one spirit.</p>
<p>In the meetings, we need to take care of our mingled spirit. We have to learn how to exercise our spirit. Whenever we touch our spirit, use our spirit, exercise our spirit, the Spirit within our spirit immediately works. The two spirits are not only joined but also mingled as one. If two substances are mingled together and we touch one of them, we surely will touch the other one. Therefore, in our daily life and in our meeting life, we must learn how to handle, deal with, and exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>The divine Trinity consummates in the Spirit. The Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is the very consummation of the divine Trinity. The three of the divine Godhead needed a consummation, and this consummation was taken care of by the processes through which the Triune God passed. Incarnation is a part of the consummation of the Triune God. Before the incarnation, our God was &ldquo;raw.&rdquo; God had to pass through incarnation to be &ldquo;cooked.&rdquo; When groceries are cooked, they are consummated to make a meal. Before the incarnation, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was there, but He had not been cooked, or consummated. Before the incarnation, was there any humanity in the Godhead? Although our God is omniscient, He did not have the experience of human life or human living. But after His incarnation, the Triune God picked up humanity and passed through human living for thirty-three and a half years. Thirty-three and a half years of human living is a long process. Before the incarnation, there was nothing of human living contained in the Godhead. But today the Godhead contains the riches of human living.</p>
<p>Another process the Triune God passed through was the wonderful death of Christ. In Adam death is a terrible term, but in Christ death is very sweet. We all have to experience the death in Christ. This death was not in the Godhead before the incarnation of the Triune God and the death of Christ, the Triune God-man. But today death is included. Death is contained in the Triune God-man. The death in Adam is fully negative, but the death in Christ is wonderfully positive. It is a dear death, a lovable death. The Triune God also passed through the processes of resurrection and ascension. He was God in the heavens before His incarnation, but He had never come down from the heavens, descended to Hades, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the highest place in the universe. The resurrection and the ascension became a part of His experience. In the Godhead today, there is the element of ascension.</p>
<p>Incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are wonderful items that we should love and treasure. Don&rsquo;t you love incarnation? Don&rsquo;t you love His humanity? Don&rsquo;t you love His human living on this earth? He was a little babe, He was even a boy of twelve years, and He was a man of thirty-three years. Don&rsquo;t you love His death? Don&rsquo;t you treasure His resurrection? Paul wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and he was even desiring to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10). Do you appreciate being conformed to the death of Christ, and have you asked the Lord to conform you to His death? Instead of praying in this way, you may have prayed many religious prayers, asking the Lord to help you be holy and humble. We should tell the Lord that we want to know Him and the power of His resurrection, being conformed to His death. All these elements today are wrapped up with the divine Trinity. As His believers, we must learn how to handle all these items of the Triune God&rsquo;s process whenever we meet because these items are the very essences, or elements, of the consummation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Before the resurrection of Christ the Triune God had never been consummated. After the resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples and charged them to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Why was this charge given right after His resurrection? The right time for Him to charge His disciples to baptize the new believers into the Triune God was after His resurrection because before that moment, the Triune God had not yet been completed, or consummated. In resurrection Christ, the very embodiment of the Triune God, became a life-giving Spirit. Thus, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the completion of the Triune God. The Triune God was perfect, but He was not yet completed before the resurrection of Christ. He was completed with incarnation, with human living, with the all-inclusive death of Christ, with the resurrection of Christ, and with the ascension of Christ. When the Spirit was poured out from the heavens by the ascended Christ, that Spirit was the consummation of the Triune God, the reality of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the last chapter of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Spirit is mentioned without any adjective. He is not referred to as the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God, but as <em>the</em> Spirit (Rev. 22:17a). The Spirit, this unique Spirit, is the very consummation of the processed Triune God. This One says something together with another one in Revelation 22. The other one is the bride, the consummated humanity. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the bride is the consummation of the tripartite mankind. After the processes they both have gone through, they both form a universal couple. The husband is the consummation of God and the wife is the consummation of man. We will be the consummated mankind as the very wife to the consummated Triune God. The record of the sixty-six books of the Bible is a record of a romance. The consummated God, the Spirit, falls in love with the consummated man.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed God is in our spirit, in our mouth, and in our heart (Rom. 8:16; 10:8), and He will never leave us. He stays with us forever. When we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; or &ldquo;O Father God,&rdquo; immediately we touch Him. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; out of a pure heart, we have a sweet feeling within. When Paul met the Lord on the road to Damascus, the Lord spoke to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). When Paul heard this, he did not understand. He said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord responded, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting&rdquo; (v. 5). He did not realize that the &ldquo;Me&rdquo; he was persecuting was a corporate Me, comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers. He thought he was persecuting the followers of Jesus, not knowing that when he persecuted them, he persecuted Jesus, for they were one with Him by being united to Him through their faith in Him. After the Apostle Paul had received the Lord, Ananias told him, &ldquo;Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). According to the Greek, &ldquo;calling&rdquo; is a participle as an adverb modifying &ldquo;be baptized.&rdquo; This indicates that while Paul was being baptized he was calling on the name of the Lord. When we go to visit people and lead them to believe and be baptized, we must instruct them to call. We can say, &ldquo;While I am putting you into this water, you have to call on the name of the Lord&mdash;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Romans 10:12 says that &ldquo;the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; The Lord is rich to all the ones who call on His name.</p>
<p>When we call upon the Lord, we receive Him as the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is the Spirit. Some may consider that the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is so marvelous that He is beyond our understanding and apprehension. Although the Spirit is so marvelous, He is as available as the air. Our physical body lives by the air. If the air were not so available to us, we would die within a short time. The air is so great, but it is so available and even so cheap. I do not spend money for air. Wherever I go, the air follows me. Wherever I go, the air is waiting for me. Air is so great, yet the greatest thing in this universe is the most normal, the most common. Today the Bible likens the consummated God, the Spirit, to air. Everything that we enjoy of the Triune God today is miraculous yet very normal. Thus, when we come to the meeting we must know how to handle such a normal Christian experience, that is, the exercise of our spirit to contact the Spirit.</p>
<p>From 1969 to 1972 in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, the saints practiced calling on the name of the Lord on the way to the meetings and in the meetings, but after 1972 that practice began to disappear. Today we often come to the meeting in a quiet way, and we are even quiet in the meeting. We come into the meeting so quietly because we are used to this. Why would we not call audibly on the name of the Lord? When we were home, were we that silent? Outside of the meeting hall we may be very talkative and loud, but the meeting hall is a place that silences people. Do we need to wait for somebody to speak something, to call a hymn, to name a verse, or to read to us in the meeting? After so many years in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, many of us still need a leading one to stand up and tell us to read the Scriptures. This shows that speaking in the meetings has not been built up as a habit in our spirit.</p>
<p>Why are we Christians today so weak? Why are our meetings so dead and even so deadening? It is because we are too silent. Is our God a dumb God? When Paul talks about the Christian meeting in 1 Corinthians 14:26, he begins from chapter twelve. In his opening word of this chapter Paul points out that our God is not a dumb God. Today we do not worship the dumb idols, but we worship a speaking God (vv. 2-3). Our God is a speaking God. God has spoken, and God is still speaking (Heb. 1:1-2). Therefore, we must be the speaking people. We must learn to speak.</p>
<p>Our Christian heritage today is in two things&mdash;the Word and the Spirit. We have the Word without and the Spirit within, and these two are one. The Word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Word. When I have the Word in my hands it is the Word outside of me, but when I pray-read the Word, it gets into me and becomes the Spirit. When I speak the Spirit out to you, the Spirit becomes the word, and when you receive this word into you, it becomes the Spirit. As I am speaking the word, you are receiving the Spirit. But the strangest thing is this&mdash;we are supposed to be the speaking people of the speaking God, yet we do not speak. We need to learn how to handle the Word and the Spirit. My intention and my burden is that the saints would learn how to speak forth Christ properly, to speak in the Spirit and with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Another basic factor and element in our meetings is prayer. We have to learn to pray. The word and the Spirit must issue in our praying. In our meetings there should be many prayers. Many of our prayers, however, are too formal, too religious, and too legal. We may pray merely to fulfill our church responsibility. Before a certain brother was appointed as an elder, he may have hardly prayed in the church meetings. After he was appointed to be an elder, however, he came to the front row and began to pray. That is not a genuine prayer but a fulfilling of duty as an elder. We need to forget about that kind of formal, official, duty-fulfilling prayer. I have known some saints in the past who have criticized others for praying three or four times in the meeting. These ones were critical, yet they themselves did not pray at all in the meeting. Actually, our church meetings need to be full of spontaneous and living prayers. We offer too many religious, duty-fulfilling prayers. Our prayers are not that spontaneous, real, genuine, or true. They are not that much in our spirit. We should not plan what to pray ahead of time. Our prayers should come out of us spontaneously in the way that we breathe. Our meetings are dead because we are short of these living, spontaneous prayers.</p>
<p>Another basic factor and element in our meetings is singing. Both speaking and singing are the issue of the infilling of our spirit. If we are filled in our spirit something will flow out of us in speaking and singing. In Ephesians 5:18-19, Paul tells us to &ldquo;be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Colossians 3:16, a sister verse to Ephesians 5:19, says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; The issue of our allowing the word to fill us is speaking and singing. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are more for speaking than for singing. In our present practice, we mostly sing the hymns. We have not built up a habit of speaking the hymns to one another. We must learn to speak the hymns. Some of us fall into formality with our singing. Others sing crazily. But where is the real singing with the spirit and with the mind (1 Cor. 14:15)? We must exercise our regenerated spirit with our renewed mind in singing to the Lord. Our meetings are short of the word, the spirit, praying, and singing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
