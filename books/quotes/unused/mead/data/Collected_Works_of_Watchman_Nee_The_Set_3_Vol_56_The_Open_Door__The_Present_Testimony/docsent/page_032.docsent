   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Producing of Many Denominations</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This view creates two problems: we have just seen the problem from the viewpoint of the state church; now we must see it from the viewpoint of the dissenters, many of whom did not approve of the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They not only disapproved but also stood up to oppose the errors of the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such were the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Wesleyans.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Wesleyans thought that preaching could be done everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As dissenters, they rose up and formed churches to maintain the truth based upon their dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Wesleyan Church, the Quaker Church, and later several thousand groups, arose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In England they were called the dissenters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Russian Empire, the state church was called the Russian Orthodox Church, and the rest were called sects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these brothers rose up for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a good point!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regrettably, however, they tried to maintain God's truth by setting up new churches, thus causing the church of God to be divided into several thousand parts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, the situation gradually changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first generation of their existence both sides argued considerably.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, Wesley argued fiercely with the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the third and fourth generations, however, the arguing subsided, and there was not much difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly, they would not greet one another and communicate with each other, but today they even pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, the United Christian Church, which was originally in the Wesleyan Church, demanded that Wesleyans accept the doctrine of divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They argued so terribly over this matter that they later separated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in the third generation, they no longer argue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the beginning the differences were great, but now they are not great.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of the people in the United Christian Church, however, believed in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They left to establish the Pentecostal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At first, there were terrible arguments among them, but now it no longer matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today all these churches have been formed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some formed the Baptist Church because of baptism, some formed the Lutheran Church because of Luther, some formed the Methodist Church because of Wesley, and some formed the Christian and Missionary Alliance because of Simpson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible, however, no church was formed based on a certain doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is not one instance in the Bible where a special doctrine warrants the establishment of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the apostle Paul, the doctrines which men have argued most strongly about were not major problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 14 Paul said it is all right for one man to observe this day while another observes another day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may be for one day, while others may be for another day, while still others may be for both days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These people are weak in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But they should not be divided by doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some do not eat meat because they are weak in the faith, but they feel it is all right to eat vegetables v. 2 . Paul did not form a vegetarian church, nor did he form a meat-eating church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some ate vegetables and some ate meat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul said none of these should pose any problem; we should receive those whom the Lord has received because God has received them Rom 14:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he eats vegetables, he is a brother; if he eats meat, he is still a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he observes this day, he is a brother; if he observes another day, he is still a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no example in the Bible of forming a church according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Bible, how is the church formed?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only requirement is in Romans 14: "Receive..for God has received him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must receive whomever God receives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We receive him because God has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Formerly, he was a sinner, but now he has come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only question we need to ask is whether or not he has received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he has, any further word is unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As to his behavior as a Christian, we should help him with the teachings of the Bible, but we cannot refuse him and put him outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some believe in baptism by sprinkling; they are better than those who do not baptize at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Salvation Army does not sprinkle and neither do the Quakers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some baptize by rubbing drops of water; others baptize by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Philip and the eunuch went down into the water Acts 8:38 , and the Lord Jesus came out of the water Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Going down and coming up must mean baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, some people only immerse their hands in the water, not their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the Scriptures, we must be immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today some baptize by rubbing on water.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not tell them that they belong to the "water-rubbing" church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot establish a church according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regardless of whether baptism is by immersion or by rubbing on water, we can only ask, Have these brothers been received by God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have these brothers been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If they are saved, despite whether or not they have been rubbed with water, they will stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can we not receive them?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are going to spend eternity with them, how can we not receive them today?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How can we each go our own way because we cannot accept others' shortcomings?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This should not be!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible shows that the church includes all those whom the Lord has received.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, in Romans 14 Paul said, "Now him who is weak in faith receive," not reject.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We recognize that this brother is weak, but we must not reject him; rather, we must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Often we err by considering that he can follow us only if his faith is as strong as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, we need to see that we must receive those who are weak in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we reject them, at the most we can shut them out of the church for a few score of years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot shut them out forever.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have no way to excommunicate them; they are our brothers forever.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must realize that to divide the church according to doctrines will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Suppose a brother in the church at Sian is a vegetarian.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can only ask one question: Has this person been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If he has been saved and continues his diet of vegetables, we must allow him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In other words, he has received the same life; therefore, regardless of his preference, we have to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must help those who are weak in the faith with the teachings of the Bible, not separate from them by forming another church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today, the so-called denominations have been brought forth as the result of division over doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>People take a doctrine from the Bible, preach it, and form a denomination around it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Consequently, there is the Pentecostal Church, the Lutheran Church, the Quakers, etc. The Quakers stress a gesture quaking , the Lutherans a doctrine, the Presbyterians an organization, and the Congregationalists an independent congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These are not the work of the Lord but the result of man's ideas which have divided the children of God into so many denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many think it is good to have denominations because it is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers! if you asked me whether or not I like denominations according to the flesh, I would say, "Yes, I like them, because everything is clear-cut.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those who like to speak in tongues can go to the Tongues Church, those who like independent congregations can go to the Congregational Church, and those who do not like sprinkling can go to the Salvation Army."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But the Bible teaches that there should be only one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In Corinth there is only one church, in Ephesus there is only one church, and in Shanghai there should be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This way is not convenient because everyone must love all of the brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Loving many brothers who are not like us causes much friction and many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You have your proposals, and I have my proposals; you have your ideas, and I have my ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is very convenient for you to have your church and for me to have my church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not so convenient for us today; to be together in one church means that we have to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>With many difficulties there are many lessons, but with more difficulties, there also is the need for more love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even though we are unhappy, we still cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whether or not we like it, we still must be brothers together.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must overcome the carnal by the spiritual, conquer all differences by love, and cover all difficulties by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Otherwise, the church cannot succeed.</S>
