   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIDDEN DIVISIVE FACTORS IN THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The present trouble among us had its beginning in the past, but the fermentation or leavening process was not significantly manifested until 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This fermenting process has continued over the past few years and has become fully exposed this year 1989 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In August of this year, the brothers who are taking the lead in the present trouble began to publish a paper called The Word and the Testimony in open opposition to the Lord s recovery and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From 1984 to 1986 I called three urgent elders trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first was in February 1984, the second in September 1985, and the last in February 1986 see Elders Training, Books 1-8, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My opening word in two of these three elders trainings was concerning the danger of division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Intention to Do an Extra Work</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in the Unique Work of the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The present problem among us came out of something which was hidden in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One of these hidden things was the intention to do an extra work in the unique work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the recovery there is a definite work which is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But among us, there was a case of someone who wanted to do an extra work within the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This person would not leave the recovery or give up the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, he insisted on having a particular work of his own, by his own effort, within the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was a divisive factor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Tendency to Keep Separate Territories</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another hidden divisive factor is the tendency to keep separate territories.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s work and move for the accomplishment of God s eternal economy is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we consider any region in which we are participating in the Lord s unique work as our particular territory, this will be a cause or a factor of division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the tendency to keep a separate territory should be uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should work for the Lord within His measure 2 Cor 10:13-16 , but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our local work in our region should be for the Lord s universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament we cannot see such a thing as jurisdiction in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Way of Not Having One s Work</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mingled with Others Work</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one s work mingled with others work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament unveils to us that Peter s work for the Lord, mainly in the Jewish land, and Paul s, mainly in the Gentile world, were all for the one Body of Christ, without any distinction or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, they were one in the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The effect of Peter s work was realized in Corinth 1 Cor 1:12 , and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there Acts 15:2, 4; 21:17-20a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of fellowship, like the blood circulation of our physical body, helps the Body of Christ in the circulation of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It mingles the different pieces of our work for the Lord s recovery into one move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our work is void of this kind of fellowship, this may develop into another factor of division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Hidden Expectation of Being</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>a Prominent Figure in the Lord s Work</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was also the hidden expectation of being a prominent figure in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot deny that this gopher of ambition was among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problem among us today is that a number of brothers have ambition but do not have the capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ambition plus incapacity is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you desire to be a prominent figure and you have that capacity, you may become such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If all the churches are helped by you and all the churches listen to you, you may become a prominent figure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you do not have the capacity and you want to become prominent, this is when a problem comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can see the difference in capacity with Barnabas and Paul in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Barnabas was used by the Lord to bring Saul, who became Paul, into the ministry Acts 9:26-27; 11:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, in Acts 13 Barnabas s name was mentioned first when the list of prophets and teachers in Antioch was recorded and when the Spirit set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Shortly after they went out, the matter of capacity arose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2, 7 ; then Paul s name began to be mentioned first vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>9, 13, 16, 46, 50 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s name was mentioned first because his capacity to meet the need at that time was greater than Barnabas s, and he eventually became the leading speaker 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul began to take the lead on their journey because he had a greater capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Barnabas did not have the capacity that Paul had.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later, Paul wrote fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who could speak as much, as deeply, or as high as Paul spoke?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of all the writers of the New Testament, Paul was the only one to use the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The other writers did not use this term or the term economy, because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Paul and Barnabas returned from their trip to Antioch, a big problem arose concerning circumcision, and the church in Antioch sent them to Jerusalem to fellowship so that the problem could be solved Acts 15:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey v. 36 . At this juncture Barnabas wanted to bring his cousin, John Mark v. 37; Col 4:10 , on the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey Acts 13:13 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Barnabas s desire that Mark go with them was simply according to his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, Barnabas and Paul separated from each other 15:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From that point on, even though Barnabas might have gone out to visit the churches, his ministry was finished as far as the holy record in Acts is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to my understanding, the problem between Paul and Barnabas consisted mainly of two points.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, Barnabas might have had some hidden unhappiness within him, because he took the lead at the beginning and later Paul began to take the lead since Barnabas had a smaller capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This was not an easy matter to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If Barnabas had been happy about this development, that would have been a great mercy to Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second, according to the record in Acts 15, Barnabas did not keep a proper principle in taking John Mark with him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Apparently, he did this only because of his own personal feeling concerning his cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This violated the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Barnabas should have submitted to Paul s way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead of submitting to Paul, Barnabas took his own way, and this resulted in a separation between him and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this, he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For more than twenty-five years in this country, I never told people that I was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But in these past few years, some brothers began to talk considerably about apostles and have said that there are not one, but many apostles among us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In a meeting of the church in Anaheim on August 28, 1988, one of the sixteen points concerning the standing of the church in Anaheim, a point presented by a certain brother, was that there are many apostles among us today, not just one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He said that he would give a list of these apostles to any of the saints who were interested.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One brother asked for and received such a list from that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Shortly after I received news concerning this list, I went to Taipei, and I gave a message there concerning the three different kinds of apostles see A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>25-29, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The seven brothers on that list were all under my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>According to the truth concerning the kinds of apostles, this would make them apostles like Timothy, Titus, and Silas, who were produced by the Lord s directly appointed apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After this message was published, another word came out saying that there are no apostles today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is similar to what John Nelson Darby taught.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It was said that the selection of Matthias by lot in Acts 1 was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But according to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost 2:14 , he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This kind of speaking is based on whatever would be a benefit to the speaker and does not have the standard of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is a basic problem.</S>
