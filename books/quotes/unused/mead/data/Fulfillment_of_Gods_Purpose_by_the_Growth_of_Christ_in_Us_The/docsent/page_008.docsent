   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hymns, #255 by A.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>B. Simpson is a hymn on breathing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The chorus of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am breathing out my sorrow,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Breathing out my sin;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am breathing, breathing, breathing,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All Thy fulness in.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time I introduced this hymn was in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a brother among us then who had a Brethren background.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he first heard this hymn, he did not like it because it was against his religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But eventually this brother learned how to breathe in the Lord, and he appreciated this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can never give up breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Breathing is simple, but it is not simple to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the Lord is the Spirit, and He is also the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, the Spirit is the pneuma, the breath John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, the Word is also the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So every part of the Scripture is a part of the divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Spirit and the Word, the Lord is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, you can never get the Word into you as life merely by reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only way for you to get the Word into you as life is by breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are going to get the Word as the breath into you, you have to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, we need to read the Bible, but mere reading does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to read the Word by breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me illustrate a little bit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I merely read this verse, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if I breathe in this verse by pray-reading through calling on the name of the Lord, the Lord will come into me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need prayer to match your reading, prayer to mingle with your reading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While you are reading, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This prayer is your breathing, and this breathing is by calling upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 5:22 says that the wives should submit themselves to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many wives appreciate others' husbands, but the Lord tells them to submit themselves to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After reading this verse a number of times, a sister may make up her mind to submit herself to her own husband.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She received the word in black and white and gained knowledge in her mind, but she did not get life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way to take this word into us as life is to mingle our reading with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A sister could pray, "O Lord, wives.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>O Lord, wives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Submit yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, I can't submit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To your own husband.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord, I can submit to others' husbands, but not to my own.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>O Lord, I need You to be my person!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you mingle your reading with prayer in this way, you receive the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would advise you never to make up your mind to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is a kind of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you make up your mind to submit, you have turned from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when you read the Word with prayer, this is the feeding on the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you make up your mind to reckon yourself dead, this will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No verse of the Bible will work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot take the Word into you as life by mere reading.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many Christians read the Bible, but their lives have remained the same for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Bible readers have gotten a lot of knowledge from the Bible, but no life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, there is no transformation, no inward, metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is because they have made the word of the Bible the letter, and the letter kills 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They make the book of life a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Knowledge puffs up 1 Cor 8:1 , and knowledge brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The right way is to read the Word by breathing, to read the Word by calling on the name of the Lord, so that we may make the Word one with the Spirit.</S>
