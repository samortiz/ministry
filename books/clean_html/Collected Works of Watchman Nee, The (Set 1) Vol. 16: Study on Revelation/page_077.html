<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Revelation 21:3</H2><P>"And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."</P><P>"A loud voice." This may still be the Lord's voice. "He will tabernacle with them." Hereafter, there will no longer be any distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles. God now only cares for men. "The tabernacle of God is with men." The New Jerusalem on the earth is the tabernacle of God. Formerly, when the Israelites were on earth, the tabernacle of God was set up among the people. Now there is no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles, so the tabernacle of God is with men. God is now dwelling with men. "They will be His peoples" means that, hereafter, they will belong to God and take delight in Him and listen to His word. "And God Himself will...be their God" means that God will take care of them according to what He purposes and will give grace to them (Jer. 24:7; Ezek. 11:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Revelation 21:4</H2><P>"And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away." </P><P>"Every tear." Tears are a common experience for the people of the earth. But now God wipes away their tears by wiping away the causes of tears, such as death, sadness, pain, and so forth, which all come from sin. Therefore, when these things are wiped away, there will no longer be any trace of sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Difference between<br>the Saved and the Perishing<br>(Revelation 21:5-8)</H2><P>Although these portions, Revelation 21:2-4 and 21:5-8, are closely related to each other, the people in the second half of verse 6 are totally different from those in verse 3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 21:5</H2><P>"And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true." </P><P>"He who sits on the throne" is probably God. "Write" means to write this in a book. We can see from the way this is spoken, that this section is especially important.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Revelation 21:6</H2><P>"And He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</P><P>The second sentence in verse 5 says, "Write," and the first sentence of verse 6 says, "They have come to pass." Even though the words "They have come to pass" are said ahead of time, all that is spoken in this book will be fulfilled. God will restore the heavens and the earth to their original condition. He is "the Alpha and the Omega"; therefore, all will be accomplished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Revelation 21:7</H2><P>"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me." </P><P>The overcoming here is different from that in chapters two and three of this book. In chapters two and three it is the overcoming in the matter of conduct, that is, the overcoming that involves a comparing of believers with believers. But the overcoming here is the overcoming that involves a comparison of believers with unbelievers in the world (1 John 5:4).</P><P>What is the difference between the people in verses 6 through 7 and those in verse 3?</P><P>(1) According to verse 3, John saw in a vision that the tabernacle of God is with men, that is, God is dwelling with many people on the earth. The people in the second half of 21:6 are those who are thirsty after hearing the gospel preaching mentioned previously.</P><P>(2) The people in verse 3 are the people of God who live on the new earth; those in verse 7 are the sons of God who live in the new city.</P><P>(3) The people in verse 3 simply receive the common, entire portion of those on the earth, which is to be the people of God. But the people in verse 7 are not only the sons of God, but also His servants and kings (22:3, 5).</P><P>(4) "They will be His peoples" in verse 3 indicates something corporate and common. "He will be a son" in verse 7 refers to something particular and intimate.</P><P>(5) "They will be His peoples" in verse 3 is spoken in the third person; it is said by men. "I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me" in verse 7 is spoken by God directly.</P><P>(6) The people in verse 3 dwell on God's new earth, but those in verse 7 dwell in God's house.</P><P>Differences in position among Christians are limited to the millennial kingdom. In the new heaven and new earth, all believers will be equal.</P>
