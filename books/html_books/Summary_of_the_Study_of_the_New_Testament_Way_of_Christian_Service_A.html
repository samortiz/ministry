I began this study in October of 1984. In this four and a half year study, the Lord has shown us four major points: the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, the practice of the raising up of the new believers, the practice of the perfecting of the saints, and the practice of prophesying-speaking for God and Christ, speaking forth God and Christ to impart (dispense) God and Christ into others, to minister Christ as life and life supply to people. These four practices are the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today. These points are very new to us. I consider them as new light, a new vision to us from the Lord.<p>The Lord has shown us the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God (Rom. 15:16). This practice involves preaching the gospel by visiting people. Throughout church history, some lovers of Jesus practiced preaching the gospel by visiting people. This is not altogether new to us, but it has not been a general practice among us. We have not paid much attention to it. Two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, practice visiting people in their homes. As a result, some devoted Christians may have despised this practice. But no one can say that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is wrong. No one has the ground to condemn such a practice. We knocked on the doors of half a million homes in Taipei, and we baptized approximately thirty-eight thousand people. To preach the gospel by visiting people is the main principle of gospel preaching in the New Testament. Christ came to visit people. The preaching of the gospel by visiting people where they are is a new practice among us.<p>In these recent years, the Lord has particularly impressed us with the priesthood of the gospel of God in the New Testament. First Peter and Revelation tell us that all the believers are priests, a universal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:5b-6a; 5:9b-10). All the New Testament believers are priests, and the New Testament priests are the priests of the gospel of God. According to Romans 15:16, Paul considered himself as a New Testament priest of the gospel.<p>The main duty of the priests in the Old Testament was to offer the sacrifices to God. It was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offerings which the New Testament priests offer to God. According to Romans 15:16, Paul was a New Testament priest offering the saved sinners to God as sacrifices. We feel that the best translation of this verse is as follows: &#8220;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Paul was a priest who was laboring and ministering. He was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. We are not merely preachers of the gospel but priests of the gospel.<p>After people believe and are baptized through our priestly labor, they need to be raised up in the Lord. Therefore, we need to have home meetings with them to nourish and cherish them until they are established in the faith. Gradually, the Lord showed us that we need to have group meetings to take care of the new believers that they may grow not only in life but also in truth. The group meetings are for perfecting the saints in life and in truth.<p>The fourth item in the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today is the practice of prophesying in the church meetings. The church meeting in mutuality with all speaking for building up was seen by Brother Watchman Nee more than fifty years ago. We saw what was required by God in the New Testament concerning the church meetings of mutuality. We had the vision, but we did not have the way to practice it. Now the Lord is bringing us into the practice of having church meetings with all prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>Within the last ten years, I believe that many of us were considering the way we should take to practice the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We were not that certain or definite in every step which we were taking for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The four practices that the Lord has shown us in His present recovery are the conclusion of our four and a half year study beginning in October of 1984. They are very certain and definite. They are the scriptural, God-ordained way of Christian service for the organic building up of the Body of Christ. According to the New Testament teaching, we should practice this God-ordained way in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We have already spoken much concerning the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today, and we have printed much literature on this subject. What we will present in this small book is a summary of what we have received as a result of our four and a half year study. This may be considered as a summary of the study of the New Testament way of Christian service.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2><p>In the advance of the Lord&#8217;s recovery today, we need to be brought into the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God (Rom. 15:16). The gospel of God (1:1) does not merely comprise Christ&#8217;s salvation of sinners. This is just a small part of the entire gospel of God. The gospel of God is God&#8217;s entire New Testament economy. The entire New Testament, from Matthew 1 to Revelation 22, is God&#8217;s gospel. The first item of this gospel is the incarnation of the Triune God to be a man, and the last item is the New Jerusalem. These items and all of the items in between them are the gospel of God. When we refer to the gospel of God, I hope we understand that it is the entire New Testament, from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>As the priests of the gospel, we preach the gospel of God to regenerate sinners with the divine life (John 1:12-13) for the building up of the church as the organism of the processed Triune God (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 1:23; 3:19b). The priesthood is the universal priesthood (Rev. 1:5b-6a; 5:9b-10). This means that every believer is a priest. The universal priesthood is for the preaching of the gospel of God&#8217;s salvation (1 Pet. 2:9). Our preaching is to produce new believers by seeking and visiting the lost sinners (Luke 19:10; 10:1-6). The main way to preach the gospel is not to invite people to come to us but to visit them where they are. The Lord Jesus came down from heaven to visit the sinners on the earth (1 Tim. 1:15). He visited Zaccheus with His dynamic salvation (Luke 19:1-10), and He visited the Samaritan woman to bring her the living water (John 4:3-15). He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace (Matt. 10:5-8, 11-13). He sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace and even to stay with them in their homes for the preaching of the gospel (Luke 10:1-6). We must learn of the Lord and follow the pattern established in the New Testament.<p>As the New Testament priests, we offer the saved sinners as parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ to God as the New Testament sacrifices of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). In the Old Testament, the priests&#8217; main work was to offer the sacrifices. These sacrifices are types of Christ. Then in the New Testament, the priests are still offering the sacrifices. These sacrifices are the saved sinners as parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ. As the New Testament priests, we should offer parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ as sacrifices to God for the building up of God&#8217;s spiritual house-the church as the organism of the Triune God (1 Pet. 2:5).<p>We should go to seek out sinners by visiting them and meeting with them in their homes that they may be saved to become new believers. These new believers are for the building up of the church as the very organism of the processed Triune God. This way to preach the gospel is absolutely scriptural and absolutely ordained by God. We need to practice this God-ordained way to preach the gospel.<p>In order for us to practice this God-ordained way to preach the gospel, we all need a revival. Every morning we need to have a new beginning in our Christian life. We need to be revived and renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). Leviticus 27 shows us that we need to devote ourselves to the Lord by making a vow to Him. For the new practice of the God-ordained way we all need to make a vow to the Lord. This vow should be like the Nazarite vow in Numbers 6, a vow in which we give ourselves to the Lord to carry out His New Testament economy. In order to carry out His New Testament economy, God sends us out to seek and visit sinners that we may bring them to Christ and that they may become new believers for the building up of the churches, which in totality are the organism of the processed Triune God. We may wonder what the contents of our vow should be. In our vow we can pray, &#8220;Lord, keep me faithful so that I will take Your word and Your ordination to go out to seek the sinners, to visit the sinners to bring them to You that they may become Your new members and new believers for the building up of Your Body. Lord, I ask You to make me faithful to always keep two or three new believers under my care.&#8221; How can we have these new believers? We can have them by visiting the sinners and getting them saved.<p>We need to see the best way, practically speaking, to labor in the gospel. We can put the names of all the persons whom we know on a list beginning with those who are closely related to us-our parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, in-laws, uncles, aunts, etc. We can then put down the names of our classmates, colleagues, and friends. We can also put down the names of our neighbors. I believe that each one of us will have the names of at least fifty persons. Then we can consider the persons on the list to see which ones have not been saved. We can pray for all of those who have not been saved. Then we can seek the Lord&#8217;s leading by praying, &#8220;Lord, among these unsaved persons whom I know, which ones should I visit first?&#8221; We can go to visit these according to the Lord&#8217;s leading. Before going, we have to pray. Sometimes we must pick up the burden to match our prayer with fasting because we consider this quite serious.<p>We do not need to go to visit people for the gospel every day. Perhaps we may go one day a week. Also, to go alone is not so effective. It is better for us to go in a little team of three saints. Then we have to fellowship with the other saints. Eventually, by going out to visit people in this way, we will gain two to three for the Lord. It may be that we will not gain anyone the first week, but we should not be disappointed. In the second week, we may baptize two. We need to keep visiting people until there are two or three new ones under the care of each one of us. Then we do not need to baptize any more because two or three new ones are enough for us to take care of. We need to take care of these two or three new ones for about two or three months. After a period of time, we may not have the way to take two of them on with the Lord due to certain circumstances. We will then need to spend some time to baptize more new ones to replace them. In this way each one of us will always have two or three new believers under our care year-round. We take care of the new ones by having home meetings with them to bring them to know the Lord more and more that they may grow in the knowledge of Christ and grow in the divine life.<p>We should not be hot and burning in our labor for two weeks and then cold the next week. We need to labor in the gospel regularly and constantly. We can first visit all the people whom we know to gain two or three new believers for the Lord. When we have two or three new ones under our care, there will be no need for us to go out to baptize more because we will not be able to care for them all. We should not bring forth too many children. According to God&#8217;s natural law, it takes nine months to bear a child. God regulates childbearing according to His natural law. This shows that even in the spiritual realm, we should not bring forth too many new ones too quickly. We have to bring forth spiritual children slowly and steadily.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE RAISING UP OF THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>After new ones are begotten through our preaching of the gospel, we need to raise them up. We need to go weekly to have home meetings with them in their homes (Acts 5:42). The home meetings are the place for us to function as nursing mothers to nourish and cherish the new ones (1 Thes. 2:7). We need to consider that we are mothers and all the new ones are our children. As the mothers, we need to nourish and cherish them. To cherish the children is to make them happy by nurturing them with tender love and fostering them with tender care. To have home meetings with the new believers is also for feeding them as the Lord&#8217;s lambs. In John 21:15 the Lord charged Peter to feed His lambs. The lambs are the young ones.<p>We need to take care of them regularly and constantly until they are established in the faith and present themselves to God as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). At the time when the new believers were saved, we presented them to God as spiritual sacrifices, the sacrifices of the gospel (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). While we are caring for them, we are helping them to grow. Over a period of time, we want to lead them to offer themselves to God as living sacrifices.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>In the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today, He also wants to recover the practice of the perfecting of the saints. This is to have all the saints perfected by the gifted ones (Eph. 4:11-12a) and by the perfected ones. After the saints have been perfected, they will perfect others.<p>Eventually, this perfecting is carried out through the group meetings (Heb. 10:24-25). In the group meetings, there is the element of teaching the saints as an entreating and consoling father (1 Thes. 2:11). In the new believers&#8217; home meetings, we should function as the nursing mothers. Then in the group meetings, we need to function as fathers who entreat and console the believers. We need to function in this way by taking the Apostle Paul as a pattern (Acts 20:20, 27, 31) until we present every one of them to God full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29). This is the third stage of offering the new believers to God. First, we offer them to God at the time of their salvation as the sacrifices of the gospel. Second, after they have been helped to grow, we lead them to offer themselves to God as living sacrifices. Third, after a certain amount of perfecting, we can present them to God full-grown in Christ.<p>The practice of the perfecting of the saints is for the purpose of having all the perfected saints do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12b). Then the Body is built up by itself through all the members-the supplying joints and the operating parts-functioning (v. 16). The real building up of the Body is by all the saints functioning either as supplying joints or as operating parts.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</h2><p>The Lord also desires to recover the practice of prophesying. In 1 Corinthians 14 prophesying is not in the sense of predicting, foretelling. In this chapter prophesying is speaking for God and Christ, speaking forth God and Christ to impart (dispense) God and Christ into others, to minister Christ as life and life supply to people. Prophesying is carried out in the proper meetings of the church when all the saints come together (vv. 23a, 26). The proper church meetings are not carried out by one person speaking and the rest listening. The proper church meetings are meetings of mutuality in which all the saints come with something to prophesy, to speak for the Lord.<p>First Corinthians 14:31 says, &#8220;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&#8221; This shows the universal capacity of each believer to prophesy. The capacity is the ability. The word can indicates the capacity, the ability, to prophesy. This capacity is in the divine life, which the believers possess and enjoy and which needs to increase within them that the capacity may be developed unto their ability.<p>Every believer not only has the capacity to prophesy but also has the universal obligation to prophesy (vv. 23a, 24-26). This obligation is the fulfillment of our spiritual service, in which we are indebted to God&#8217;s salvation. When we come to the meeting, we must be exercised to prophesy because we owe something to God, to the Lord&#8217;s salvation, and to the divine life. Since we have God, the Lord&#8217;s salvation, and the divine life, we have to speak forth Christ. Because we have the capacity to prophesy, we should bear the obligation to prophesy.<p>We should desire earnestly to prophesy, seeking it as the excelling gift for the building up of the church (vv. 1, 12, 39a). In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, &#8220;So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&#8221; Prophesying is the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling. Prophesying is excelling in revealing God&#8217;s heart, God&#8217;s will, God&#8217;s way, and God&#8217;s economy to His people. It is excelling in convicting people, exposing people&#8217;s real condition, and showing people their spiritual need (vv. 24-25). It is excelling in speaking forth Christ to minister and dispense Christ to people for nourishment. Finally, it is excelling in building up the church (v. 4b) in the organic way that it may be built up as the organism of the processed Triune God for His fullness, His expression.<p>We also need to learn to prophesy (v. 31) by being perfected by the gifted ones (Eph. 4:11-12; 2 Tim. 2:2) and by practice, rejecting any despising of prophesying (cf. 1 Thes. 5:20). Some prophecies may not seem to be so rich, so high, or so inspiring in the opinion of others. Therefore, they may despise them. While one saint is prophesying, others may show their disapproval. But 1 Thessalonians 5:20 says, &#8220;Do not despise prophecies.&#8221; We should not lightly esteem any of the saints&#8217; prophesying. Prophesying is for the building up of the church, the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12).<h2 class=head1>COOPERATING WITH THE LORD AND COORDINATING WITH THE CHURCH</h2><p>To have these four practices of the Lord&#8217;s recovery in a church is not so simple. We have all been in the old way for many years. People love their old habits. The habit of the Chinese is to use chopsticks. If you exchanged their chopsticks for forks, they would not like it. In the same way, it is very hard for the saints to change their way of meeting. We have been accustomed to having big meetings with one speaker who may be gifted, eloquent, knowledgeable, rich, living, and even exciting. We liked having such a brother and considered it a blessing to have someone to give us something exciting every Lord&#8217;s Day. Now some may feel that all these exciting brothers have been taken from our meetings. They feel that we are all suffering, coming to the meeting without a big speaker, knowing that we all have to be the speakers. Do not expect that this situation will change right away. It takes time.<p>It would be wonderful if all the churches had fully entered into the four practices of the present advance of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. However, there may be few such churches on the earth today because many of us have been in the old practice and have become used to it. Even though the leading ones in the churches may agree with these four practices, they may feel that it is difficult to practice them. Furthermore, at the present time there may be no way to practice them in some places. Therefore, for now some localities may still need a meeting in the traditional way with one person speaking and the rest listening. However, we surely need to have a change. First Corinthians 14 has to be fulfilled, and the Body of Christ has to be built up in this biblical way. We have to admit that we are in a situation which is not up to the standard of the divine revelation, at the level of God&#8217;s ordination. Because our progress has somewhat stopped, we are causing the Lord to be stopped. We need a change.<p>If the church in your locality is not ready to practice these four practices, you should not push the saints, condemn them, or criticize them. This is wrong. You should still go along with the church. Perhaps a church would only carry out the first two practices, not being ready to practice the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying. You still have to go along with the church. Do not look down on the church. Do not criticize the leading ones, do not be dissenting, and do not cause trouble. You simply should pray and let the church have time to get into something new. However, none of the elders would condemn you if, without making trouble for the church, you would pick up the burden to make a vow to go out to visit people and get two or three saved and placed under your care. Even if the church does not practice this at the present time, you may pick up a burden to do it. Do not &#8220;blow the trumpet&#8221; by declaring that you are visiting people by door-knocking. Simply go out to visit people. After some are saved, keep going to their homes to have home meetings with them to build them up and raise them up. No elder will condemn this. They would like to see you bring people to be saved and then brought into the church and established for the church life. However, they may feel that it is still not the time to bring this matter into the church life as a general practice. You have to be patient with them, but you should not be stopped. Go out to visit people and get them saved. Then keep going to visit them in their homes to have home meetings with them. By this way we can go on.<p>One church may practice all the four practices of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, while another church may only practice one. Do not be bothered, and do not condemn others. Do not say that a church is stubborn or old. It is hard for the churches to be unified in practice, especially in a short time. We should only do as much as we can, as much as the Lord leads, and as much as the environment allows. We should not despise or look down on anyone. We should not oppose, make trouble, criticize, or gossip. We should simply go along with the elders, doing what we can according to what the environment allows. Then gradually all the churches will learn. Perhaps after five years all the churches will be the same. This may be illustrated by the progress of the nations of the earth. One hundred years ago most nations did not practice democracy. Today, however, many nations are seeking after democracy; this is the age of democracy. Likewise, this is the time for the Lord to have a change, to bring His seeking ones into a new age. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should be brought into a new age. We should be willing to coordinate, to cooperate, with the Lord&#8217;s move.<p>Every item, every point, of what we have presented concerning the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery is according to the revelation of the New Testament. It is scriptural, and it is God-ordained. However, we have been practicing the church life in the way which has been handed down for nineteen centuries. We are still in an inherited, traditional practice. Now the Lord wants us to come into an age in which every item of our practice is according to God&#8217;s ordination, the divine revelation. Then the Lord will have a way to build up His organic Body. We all have to pray toward this goal, and we all have to do our best to cooperate with the Lord and to coordinate together step by step. Gradually, the entire recovery of the Lord will proceed onward. As long as we are faithful, we can reach the goal.<p>We all should bring these matters into prayer and try our best to put them into practice. However, do not do anything that will bother the church. Likewise, we should not give up what we have seen. We should not stop laboring according to the vision the Lord has shown us. According to God&#8217;s sovereign arrangement, the environment, the circumstances, and the surroundings, we must be faithful to practice what we have seen. Then we will go on peacefully with one another, and the churches will go on with one another. We will all learn from one another, and we will all be helped and improved by one another. This will give the Lord time to bring us onward until we all arrive at the goal. Ephesians 4:13 says, &#8220;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&#8221; We are now in the stage of being perfected. I hope that we will pray for all of us to enter into the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today so that we all can arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We need to put whatever we have seen into practice. At the same time, we must do our best to avoid causing any kind of trouble or hardship in the churches. May the Lord grace us as we labor together with Him in the practice of His advanced recovery today.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRACTICE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>Our burden in this book is to fellowship concerning the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today. Beginning in 1984 I began to have a new study that lasted about four and a half years. The subject of my study was the New Testament way of Christian service. We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel. We needed to investigate how to carry out these things according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Actually, throughout the history of the church, some of the seeking saints saw certain things concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, and how to preach the gospel to save sinners. They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church. A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century. Then in the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover more. In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee. He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries. We put many of the things we saw into practice. Later, we found out that some of the things in our practice were not so fitting. In 1931 the Brethren sent some saints to visit us in Shanghai, and their visit caused a lot of trouble. Brother Nee went abroad to visit them in 1933, and he saw the real situation among them. Through that visit, he saw the shortages in the practice of the Brethren. Then he saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. The Brethren did not see this. Later he saw the revelation of the meeting of the church as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so &#8220;each one has&#8221; (v. 26). Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality. This meeting is not according to the traditional way of meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening. Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity. If the meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening were taken away from Christianity, the entire structure of Christianity would collapse. Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8-NASB).<h2 class=head1>THREE PROBLEMS IN OUR PRACTICE</h2><p>In 1984 I fully realized that we needed to be adjusted and have some advancement in our practice. I saw three major problems in our practice. The first problem was concerning our practice in preaching the gospel. According to the New Testament, the preaching of the gospel should be practiced by the believers going out to visit people, not by inviting people to come to their meeting. Peter spoke to a big congregation on the day of Pentecost, but this happened under God&#8217;s sovereignty. That big congregation was prepared by God. The major way to preach the gospel is by going to visit people to bring them the Lord Jesus. Related to the preaching of the gospel, the word go is a strong word in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus charged us to go to disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19), and He Himself set up a pattern of going to people. Instead of inviting people to come to Him, He went to visit them. First, He came down from the heavens to the earth to visit people. While He was on this earth, He went out again and again. He went to village after village (Luke 8:1). He sent out the twelve and the seventy to visit people. The Lord charged the seventy to find God&#8217;s chosen sons of peace among the wolves (Luke 10:1-9). The practice of preaching the gospel in the New Testament is a practice of visiting people, but our practice was different from this. When we began to practice visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, the results confirmed the Lord&#8217;s way.<p>The second major problem in our practice was concerning the way to meet. Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937, and his messages were eventually printed in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life. In 1948 he released the messages that are now in the book entitled Church Affairs. In that book he pointed out that the Lord&#8217;s Day message meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening is not scriptural and is according to the customs of the nations. In 1984 I was reminded of Brother Nee&#8217;s fellowship, and I realized that our way of meeting was not up to the standard of the biblical revelation. The third major problem that I saw related to our practice was the matter of how the saints should function.<h2 class=head1>THREE NEW ITEMS OF REVELATION</h2><p>As a remedy to these problems, the Lord showed me three major items which are all new to me. He showed me the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4, the church meeting in mutuality in 1 Corinthians 14, and the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God. Ephesians 4 tells us that the Head in His ascension gave His Body, the church, some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (vv. 11-12). Ephesians 4 does not say that these gifted persons are for doing the particular work in their respective lines. It says that all of these gifted persons were given by the Head to the Body for the perfecting of the saints, so that the saints, after being perfected, can do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Although Ephesians 4 says this clearly, our practice has not matched this revelation. This chapter tells us about the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the very work of the ministry of the New Testament.<p>The Lord also showed me something further concerning the proper church meeting unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. This chapter is a chapter encouraging all the saints to prophesy. Paul says that we can all prophesy one by one. We may feel that we cannot prophesy, but Paul says that we all can. We have the capacity to prophesy. When I use the word capacity, I mean the power or the ability. We have the capacity, the ability, to eat and digest food according to the nature of our human life. Furthermore, all of us normally have the ability in our human life to speak. Human beings have the capacity, the ability, to speak according to their very nature. Paul says that we all can prophesy one by one because the capacity, the ability, to prophesy is in the divine life which the believers possess and enjoy. First Corinthians 14:23 through 25 says that if all prophesy when the whole church comes together, there will be the power there to convict people, to judge people, and to expose people&#8217;s real situation. When Paul says in verse 24-&#8220;if all prophesy&#8221;-this means that we all have a universal obligation to prophesy. We have the capacity to prophesy, so we have the obligation to prophesy.<p>Verse 1 and verse 39 of 1 Corinthians 14 both say that we should desire earnestly to prophesy. We have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we should desire earnestly to prophesy. Paul also told us in verse 12 that we should seek to excel to the building up of the church. This means that we should seek to prophesy because as Paul said, &#8220;He who prophesies builds up the church&#8221; (v. 4).<p>I became clear that it is altogether possible to have the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. Of course, this requires much exercise and practice. Due to the traditional practice of Christianity throughout the centuries of church history, many may feel that it is impossible to have the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. But since I saw the universal capacity, the universal obligation, and the universal desire to prophesy, I began to see that it is possible. There is the full possibility for the attendants of a church meeting to prophesy one by one because all of us have the divine life. There are many spiritual abilities, or capacities, in the very nature of the divine life which we possess. A dog cannot speak a human language because the dog&#8217;s life does not have this capacity. Human beings can learn a language because in the nature of the human life there is the ability to learn a language. In the same way, there is a spiritual capacity, an ability, in the divine life to speak for God.<p>When I began to help the saints in Taipei to practice the God-ordained way, someone said to me, &#8220;Brother Lee, everything that you have shared in the past two years is scriptural, but it cannot be worked out.&#8221; I must say, however, that I have the full assurance that this God-ordained way can be worked out because the Bible tells us so. The Bible says we can all prophesy and that whenever we come together each one has something for building up. This is our obligation. Why do we say that we cannot do this? If we give up this obligation, our attitude is that we need a &#8220;clergyman&#8221; to replace us so that he can speak to us all the time. We may feel that we need someone to speak to us who has the learning and skill. We may have the attitude of letting a few brothers bear the burden while we rest. But this practice annuls the spiritual capacity of all the saints. I believe that many of the so-called &#8220;laymen&#8221; in Christianity may be more gifted than many of the pastors.<p>In the spring of 1989, the Lord also showed us the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. The Brethren stressed that all the believers are priests, and we followed them in this matter. We stressed the universal priesthood of the believers, but it was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offering of the New Testament priests. What should a New Testament priest offer to God? In the past we saw that our praises to God and the things we do for God are spiritual sacrifices (Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18). However, we did not see that the main work of the New Testament priests is to offer the persons saved through their preaching as spiritual sacrifices to God. The sinners saved through our gospel preaching are the main offerings we should offer to God in His New Testament economy. In Romans 15:16, Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. Today we should preach the gospel as priests.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW TESTAMENT WAY OF CHRISTIAN SERVICE</h2><p>In giving us the revelation of the priesthood of the gospel of God, the raising up of the new believers, the perfecting of the saints, and prophesying, the Lord has given us a conclusion to our four and a half year study. I considered whether I could find any more verses in the New Testament concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, how to preach the gospel, etc. I believe that we have exhausted the revelation in the New Testament concerning the Christian way of service. We now have a conclusion to all the findings of the saints throughout the centuries. We must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God. The gospel of God regenerates sinners, making them the members of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. The gospel of God begins from the incarnation of the Triune God with the view of regenerating people and concludes with the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the building up of the Body of Christ. The gospel of God is not just telling people that they are sinners and that if they believe in Jesus, they will be saved and have peace and joy. This is only a small part of the gospel of God. The gospel of God is all-inclusive. As the New Testament priests, we are handling the gospel of God to save sinners, to raise them up, and to perfect them until they can prophesy.<p>Only two chapters in the New Testament tell us in a clear and definite way how the building up of the Body of Christ takes place-Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 refers to the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the New Testament ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. First Corinthians 14 reveals that prophesying is for the building up of the church. Prophesying is excelling because it builds up the church. Speaking in tongues is not excelling because it does not build up the church. This means that if we do not perfect the saints to prophesy, we have not reached the level of building up the church. Strictly speaking, there has been very little building up among us because we are short of the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying. We may care for having a big congregation, but do we care for the building up of the Body of Christ? We may only have the thought of edifying some of the saints to build them up as Christians. We do not have much thought concerning the direct building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. The perfecting of the saints and prophesying for the building up of the church are missing among us. The Lord desires to recover these items for the building up of His organic Body.<p>In order to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to visit people. The conclusion of the Old Testament priesthood and the beginning of the New Testament priesthood were in John the Baptist. He was born to be a priest. Surely his father Zachariah and his mother Elizabeth expected to see their son function in the priesthood by wearing the priestly robe, eating the priestly food, and staying in the priestly place, the temple. But probably to their surprise their son became &#8220;naughty.&#8221; He would not wear the robe of the priest. Instead he wore a garment of camel&#8217;s hair. The camel was an unclean animal according to the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11:4). Instead of eating the priestly food, John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey. His living was uncultured and without any background of religion. He became a new start in God&#8217;s move. He declared that people should repent for the kingdom of the heavens. When people repented, he &#8220;threw&#8221; them into the water. He even worked in a wild way. His living and work ended the Old Testament priesthood. John was the first New Testament priest practicing the New Testament priesthood. He did not offer the animal sacrifices, which were types of Christ. Instead he offered the repentant sinners as sacrifices to God. These repentant sinners were to be parts of the upcoming, enlarged, and corporate Christ. Paul as a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God also offered the saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5).<p>The major job of the priests is to offer the offerings. This is their major business. We have to help the saints realize that we are all priests of the gospel. We must go to save sinners to make them offerings that we can offer to God. After this we should help them to grow by having home meetings with them. To have home meetings with them is the best way to help them to grow in life and in truth. Then we have to perfect them, and the best way to do this is through the group meetings. Having home meetings in the new beginners&#8217; homes is the best way to raise them up, and having group meetings is the best way to perfect the growing saints. Then we have to lead them to prophesy. In this way they become the acting, functioning, living, real members of the church life.<p>The Lord is going to carry out this scriptural way because this has been spoken in His Word. Heaven and earth can pass away, but the Lord&#8217;s words will never pass away (Matt. 24:35). Every part of His Word will be fulfilled. Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14 will be fulfilled. The New Testament priesthood of the gospel will be carried out. It is just a matter of time. I have the deep feeling that now is the age for the Lord to carry this out. When the Lord&#8217;s move comes, it comes like a tide. When the tide comes, no one can stop it. Today in the world, democracy is like a tide. Many nations desire to have some form of democracy. The Lord&#8217;s move today is also like a tide. We have to follow the Lord in an up-to-date way. Right after we began to pay attention to preaching the gospel by knocking on people&#8217;s doors, the Southern Baptists also picked up this practice. In their recent convention in Las Vegas, many of them went out to knock on people&#8217;s doors.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO TAKE THE CHURCHES ON</h2><p>As the leading ones, we need to ask ourselves what we will do as we function in the churches. Shall we remain in our old practice prior to October of 1984? Shall we preach the gospel by inviting people to our meetings and meet on the Lord&#8217;s Day morning with a big congregation and a good speaker while the rest sit and listen? We need to ask ourselves where the real functioning of the acting members in the church is. How do the co-workers among us function? Are they perfecting the saints? We are short in our experience of the scriptural way of service. We must cooperate with the Lord.<p>I do not expect this God-ordained way to be fully consummated among us in five years. Rather, it may take twenty, twenty-five, thirty, or fifty years for the Lord to carry this out. To the Lord one thousand years are as one day. We have published many books concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ in the advance of the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. Sooner or later, some of the seeking saints will pick up some copies of these books and practice what has been released in them.<p>I do not like to impose this on anyone, but I do have a burden to promote this scriptural way. This way is like a diamond that I am presenting. I will not impose this diamond on you, but if you are wise, you will not miss the opportunity to pay the price to buy it. I realize that some of the churches are not fully ready to take this scriptural way. I am not saying that we need to begin practicing these four major practices right away. But we all have to see that in this age something is coming as a tide. Whether you are for it or against it, the tide will still come. I have the full assurance that this way is easy to work out. We only need to practice it by laboring, striving, and struggling.<p>In our locality we need to pray and seek the Lord&#8217;s leading concerning how to take the church on. It is not necessary for all the churches to be unified at the same time. We need to go on according to what we feel in the Lord and before the Lord. I would like to share something with those of us who have a burden to practice this new way. The best way to begin such a practice is to have a small local conference of three or four messages. In this conference we can present to the saints what the Lord has shown us. We should tell them that this practice is the practice of the New Testament priesthood. Therefore, we all need to have a new beginning in our Christian life every day by being revived every morning. When we have this conference, we should ask the church to pray that we could have the power to stir up all the saints to be revived and ask them to consecrate themselves anew for this practice. Later, some arrangement should be made for the consecrated saints so that they can be formed into groups of three to go out in a regular way to reach people.<p>The saints do not need to do too much because that will tire them out and frustrate them. It is better not to do too much. Instead we need to labor regularly and constantly. We only need to go out once a week for two hours. If we have the proper practice with adequate prayer, we will get some to believe and be baptized. Once we baptize two or three new ones, we should not go out to gain more people. We need to care for the two or three the Lord has given us by having home meetings with them in their homes. We should have home meetings with them at least once a week. Probably at the beginning we need to visit them twice a week, every three or four days. We have to visit them to nourish and cherish them. Then we gradually need to encourage them to come out of their homes to join the group meetings.<p>We need to take care of the new believers for at least six months. It is best if we can care for them for a year until they are established. After one year of care, they can be perfected. We should carry out the new way according to all the fellowship we have published in the recent past. If we follow the details of this fellowship in our practice, we will see that it really works. The new ones will be brought on quickly or slowly according to their particular case. As we care for them for six months to a year, they will be ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God as Romans 12:1 instructs. Eventually, they should be able to do what we can do in the priesthood of the gospel. Our group meetings will increase and eventually will have to divide.<p>We hope that at least about one-third of the saints in the church would practice this kind of gospel visitation. Suppose there is a church with one hundred saints. The leading brothers should pray, &#8220;Lord, raise up at least thirty-five of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel. We even ask You for fifty.&#8221; I have the assurance that if we practice this way according to what we have published, every saint who is exercised in this way will bring in two new ones a year. With this kind of endeavor, it is possible for the church to double in a year. Even if the church increases yearly by thirty percent, that would be the fastest growing church on this earth.<p>I would like to say again that the first step is to have a conference to stir up the saints. Then the saints who want to take this way can be grouped into teams of three to go out to visit people regularly. They can keep going to visit the ones they gain for six months to a year. After one year a group meeting should increase in size so that it can be divided into two groups.<p>The group meeting occupies eighty percent of the practical church life. The main part of the church life depends on the group meetings. In the group meetings, the saints will be spontaneously perfected to prophesy. Whether or not the saints will prophesy depends upon our practice of the group meetings. We need to take the first step to get people saved and the second step to have home meetings with them in order to raise them up in the way that parents raise up their children. Then we need to bring them into the group meetings so that they can be perfected. Nearly everyone who attends the group meetings constantly and regularly will prophesy. They will be able to prophesy, and they will have a desire to prophesy. In order to practice the group meetings in an organic way, we have much to learn.<p>We do not want to compel people to take anything or impose what we have learned on others, but we need to have some discernment to know the more excellent things. The four major steps in the advance of the Lord&#8217;s recovery today are workable, but they require our constant and regular labor. In Colossians 1:28, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ. Then in verse 29 he said, &#8220;For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&#8221; We need this kind of labor. This new way will make everyone busy because it will afford everyone the opportunity to function, to serve.<p>The governing principle of the Lord&#8217;s ordained way is that it affords equal opportunity to all the members of the Body of Christ. In preaching the gospel, in home meetings, in the group meetings, in prophesying in the church meetings, the opportunity is afforded to each of the saints. This is God&#8217;s way. The traditional way robs the saints of their opportunity to function and gives this opportunity to a small clerical class. Thus, the clergy has all the opportunities, and they do everything. The so-called laymen are left with little opportunity to do anything. In this clergy-laity system, the saints are annulled in their capacity of the divine life. In the divine life there is the capacity, the power, the ability to speak for the Lord. According to the old, traditional way, the believers seemingly have little ability because they are not allowed to participate in anything. They become pew members, coming to a Lord&#8217;s Day service to listen to a professional speaker. The Lord&#8217;s ordained way releases the saints from the bondage of this system.<p>Of course, to have any change is difficult at the beginning. To take the new way is not so easy because we are not used to it. I fully sympathize with the elders who are taking the lead and bearing the responsibility of the churches. It is easy to carry on in the old way because so much of the service is carried out in a routine way. There is not the need of much labor. But to carry out the new way, we have to practice diligently to learn something. Then we have to help others to enter into what we have learned to bring them into functioning with equal opportunity. I believe that in another five years, we will begin to see the consequence, the result, the coming out, of the new way. We want to be brought into a situation in which everyone can preach the gospel, everyone can take care of new ones, everyone can perfect others in the group meetings, and everyone can speak forth the Lord into others. Thus, whenever we come together we will have many ministers. We must exercise to discern the excellent things and the excellent way. The new way is the excellent way to organically build up the Body of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRACTICE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this chapter, I want us to be impressed that we should not function, serve, or meet in a natural way. We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally. Actually, however, our service in the New Testament is not like this.<h2 class=head1>WORSHIPPING GOD ACCORDING TO HIS NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><p>In John 4 the Samaritan woman talked with the Lord Jesus about worshipping God. Her talk was altogether natural. She said, &#8220;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&#8221; (v. 20). Then the Lord Jesus adjusted her by saying that the worship the Father God seeks after is absolutely different from this. God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (v. 24). Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit. But it requires much understanding for us to realize what it is to worship God, the very Spirit, in truth.<p>Truth in John 4:24 refers to God&#8217;s truthfulness in which we participate. Then this truthfulness of God becomes our virtue in our human living. Actually, this is Christ lived out in our daily life. We worship God in such a Christ. Christ is the reality of the Triune God, and this reality is God&#8217;s truthfulness. This truthfulness in which we participate becomes our enjoyment. Then it becomes the virtue in our human living, which is Christ lived out in our daily life. Today we worship God in such a Christ and in our spirit. This is altogether not natural. According to my study and observation, many of the brothers in the recovery talk about how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach with a natural view. This is wrong.<p>If we want to see something concerning the biblical, God-ordained way to meet, to serve, to function, and to preach, we must forget what we think that we understand. We must let go of the things that we have heard in the past concerning the traditional way. How can we escape the tradition of the old, vast, and heavy system of Christianity? In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7, the first blessing is the blessing of being poor in spirit (5:3). To be poor in spirit is to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation, but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. To the Jews, to be poor in spirit meant to empty out all the old knowledge of the Jewish religion, all the old knowledge concerning Moses, concerning Elijah, concerning the Old Testament temple, priesthood, offerings, etc. Everyone who was born as a Jew knew a lot. Then something new came embodied in this one person, Jesus. He told us that if we are going to be blessed with the kingdom of the heavens, we first have to empty ourselves in our spirit. We need to unload whatever we have in our spirit. Then we are empty, and the Spirit of truth can come in to unveil the things concerning this wonderful person, Christ, in an absolutely new way.<p>During Jesus&#8217; time on the earth, Judaism occupied the Jews and filled them up. In the same way today, Christianity is an old religion that has occupied us and is still filling us up. Whenever we talk about the things concerning God, we have many opinions, concepts, and views which are mostly according to tradition. When we talk about how to meet, we may have the concept that we need to be reverent and exercise a certain amount of fear toward God. Even the architecture of the cathedrals built in the Middle Ages-with the steep roofs, stain glass windows, and dark, dim atmosphere-was for creating fear toward God. In such places the people sit in pews, and in the Catholic cathedrals there are places to kneel down. This is the concept of worshipping God in Christianity.<p>In John 4, however, the Lord Jesus revealed that the way to worship God is to drink God as the living water (vv. 14, 24). Furthermore, the New Testament reveals the Lord&#8217;s table as the very central worship we render toward our Triune God. When the Lord established the table, did He tell us to kneel or to prostrate ourselves? What He told us to do was to take and eat the bread, which signifies the body He gave for us. He said to do this in remembrance of Him (1 Cor. 11:23-24). To worship the Lord, to remember Him, is to receive Him into us by eating Him. To remember Him is to eat Him, to masticate Him (John 6:57). To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. This is a new thought concerning the worship we render to the processed Triune God according to the New Testament economy of God. Instead of this new thought, the natural thought of worshipping God, in principle, is within us.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2><p>Thus far, after about nineteen centuries of church history, the Lord has not gained His heart&#8217;s desire. We know that He wants to have a group of people to be His organic members. This means we have to meet organically, serve organically, function organically, and preach the gospel organically. We should not preach the gospel as mere preachers, but as priests. All the preachers of the gospel of God should function as priests. Priests are not common people. If we are going to carry out God&#8217;s ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people, we have to learn to do it as priests. A priest is a person who bears four particular characteristics: he bears God&#8217;s image to express God; he has God&#8217;s dominion to represent God; he exercises his spirit to contact and receive God; and he receives God as the tree of life to live God. A priest is a person who is so close to God and according to God&#8217;s heart. As priests, we are in God and God is in us, so we are one with God. We can go to people with God, bringing God to people. The priestly preaching of the gospel brings God to people and brings people back to God. A priest is also a person who knows God&#8217;s heart, God&#8217;s will, God&#8217;s plan, God&#8217;s eternal purpose. He is one who can teach people and tell people about God, about what God wants, and about what a man should be before God. This is a priest preaching the gospel, and this priesthood is not just our profession but our life.<p>In the Old Testament, the serving by the priests was their daily life. What they ate, how they dressed, and where they lived was part of their priestly service. Their living of the priesthood was their job, their business. A priest serves God by bringing God to man and bringing man back to God. This is the priests&#8217; daily life and also their daily job. Today the New Testament believers are all New Testament priests. As such priests, they should always live a life of being one with God to bring God to man and to bring man back to God. Their living becomes their ministry, their work.<p>This is why I was so deeply impressed when the Lord showed me Romans 15:16. This verse shows that Paul preached the gospel as a laboring priest of God. He was God&#8217;s priest to carry out God&#8217;s gospel. He was not carrying out the priesthood in a light way. He was a laboring priest, a ministering priest. In the Old Testament, God wanted the types of Christ offered to Him. Therefore, the priests daily offered all kinds of sacrifices typifying Christ to God. In the New Testament, God wants the New Testament priests to offer saved sinners to Him as parts of the corporate Christ. All the sinners that we bring to God become Christ&#8217;s members, parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ. The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ, but the New Testament priests offer the parts of Christ. In Colossians 1:28 and 29, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man to God full-grown in Christ. This shows that Paul eventually offered the saved sinners to God full-grown in Christ, as parts of Christ. This is what we should do as priests of the gospel.<p>What is revealed in the New Testament concerning the preaching of the gospel is not shallow. All those who preach the gospel must do so as priests. These priests bring God to people and bring people back to God. They offer these people to God as spiritual sacrifices, as parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ. This is what Romans 15:16 reveals.<p>First Peter 2:5 and 9 show that Peter had the same thought as Paul. Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood. The priesthood in these verses refers not to the priestly service but to the priestly body. This is a group of priests built together to be a &#8220;hood,&#8221; a body. This priesthood tells out the virtues of the One who called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. To preach the gospel is to tell out God&#8217;s virtues. By His virtues we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light. This was our enjoyment of God Himself as our salvation. Some of His virtues are love, kindness, and mercy. Through God&#8217;s virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light. To tell out these virtues is to bring God to people. If we merely tell people that we are bringing God to them, they may not realize what we are talking about. This is why we must live a life of telling out God&#8217;s love and mercy to us and of telling out His forgiveness of our sins. We must live such a life. Then we go to people to bring such a God in all His virtues to them.<p>When we go to preach the gospel to people, we must exercise our priesthood. We are priests handling God&#8217;s gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem. We must serve God as priests by handling the entire gospel of God. As priests of the gospel of God, we should first get sinners regenerated. Then as nursing mothers we should nourish and cherish these new ones. We have to nourish and cherish them with the word in the Spirit, ministering life to them. We need to nourish them with the milk of the word. By doing this we help them to grow. Then we can bring them into group meetings so that they can be perfected. This fellowship should show us that whatever is revealed in the New Testament concerning how to serve is altogether different from our natural concept.<p>When the Lord&#8217;s recovery began among us, we gathered from Brother Nee all the studies he had accumulated from church history concerning the New Testament way of Christian service. We practiced what we saw from the New Testament. Then because of the Lord&#8217;s mercy, we gradually found out that what we were practicing was not so complete. We had many deficiencies. Brother Nee started to restudy the Bible beginning in 1931 for the purpose of seeing more concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach the gospel. In recent years, especially in the last four and a half years, I have also studied the Word concerning these matters. Today I believe that we are here with the result of all our study. We have studied the New Testament book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse. We cannot find any more verses concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach. We have nearly exhausted the study of the New Testament concerning the scriptural way of Christian service. If we are wise and would receive the Lord&#8217;s mercy, we will see that this is what the Lord wants to do today. This is strategic. This move of the Lord is like a tide.<p>We must also realize that the goal of the opposition today is twofold: to oppose the God-ordained way and to smear, to put down, and to put aside my ministry. Dear saints, suppose that today we put the God-ordained way aside and we put this ministry aside. What is left here today if we do this? If we reject the God-ordained way, we have no way to go on. I know that if I do not take this way, my ministry will stop. The Lord showed me this ordained way. If I would not take it or pass it on to the saints, I am finished in the ministry. I have nothing to say. The speaking of God stops in me. I want to convince you not to drop this way or reject this way. I love all of you because you love the Lord and the truth. You have sacrificed a lot to take this way. But I am a little concerned that you might be somewhat influenced to be hesitant about taking the God-ordained way. We must be like the wise merchant mentioned in Matthew 13 who sold everything to buy the pearl of great price.<p>When we practice the priestly preaching of the gospel, we are not carrying it out as we did in the past. We need to drop the old way of preaching the gospel. We should not preach in the old way, which is the natural way. We need to preach in the spiritual way. First, we have to know what a priest is and how we can be proper priests. A priest must be one who lives a daily life of revival. He is revived by the Lord every morning, and he participates in and enjoys the Lord&#8217;s victory every day. We need to be revived in the morning and victorious and overcoming during the day. We also need to help the saints become this kind of revived, overcoming person. This is the daily life of a priest.<p>Then we have to realize that the priesthood is for the gospel of God. The first item to practice in the priesthood of the gospel is to visit sinners to get them saved. We need to bring the gospel to them so that they can be regenerated to become parts of Christ. In our old way, we had big gospel meetings and invited people to come to us. These meetings were with one person speaking and the rest listening. Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist. That is the old way, but the God-ordained way is not like this. In the God-ordained way, every believer is a priest of the gospel, going to people with the gospel. The gospel is just God Himself. We go to people to bring God to them and to bring them back to God. After we baptize them, we need to sit down with them to converse with them. We should not use vain words nor should we use too many verses from the Bible. We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit. We need to learn this new way.<h2 class=head1>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD TO BE ECSTATIC</h2><p>In principle, every New Testament believer must be &#8220;crazy,&#8221; ecstatic. This is according to the teaching of the New Testament. Ephesians 5 charges us to be filled in our spirit with the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. Colossians 3 tells us we need to be filled with the word of Christ. We have to be filled with these two elements every day. Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that since we are so full, we will sing and speak in psalms (long poems), hymns (shorter ones), and spiritual songs (the shortest). When we are filled with the word and the Spirit, we are &#8220;crazy.&#8221; It is similar to how a person would feel if he just won a prize of ten million dollars. He would be ecstatic, &#8220;crazy.&#8221; Such a person is different from a formal, religious preacher. In the traditional and religious way of worship, there is no ecstasy, no &#8220;craziness,&#8221; no Spirit, and no word. In this old way, the Spirit is &#8220;in the heavens&#8221; and the word is in the Bible, but they are not in us. When these two factors-the Spirit and the word-are within us, they make us crazy. We become like an &#8220;electrical toy.&#8221; When the electricity is turned on, the electrical toy becomes &#8220;crazy&#8221; with electricity. We all need to be crazy people who are electrified by the Spirit and the word.<p>When we go to the home of some new believers in this way to have a home meeting with them, we are full of joy. We will be saying, &#8220;Amen! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!&#8221; When we get there, we will be singing. The new ones may hear us singing outside their door. When we come in, they can join us. Thus, the home meeting started before we arrived at their house. With those who have recently been baptized, we should use the time to impress them that the Lord Jesus is in them. We need to strengthen their understanding of the Lord&#8217;s presence within them.<p>In a home meeting, the wife may ask a question concerning a statue of Buddha in her home. She may say, &#8220;Before I was baptized two weeks ago, I was happy whenever I saw that statue. Now I am not happy. What is this?&#8221; Then we may respond, &#8220;You feel this way because that is an idol, and the Devil is involved with it. He is the enemy of Jesus.&#8221; Then her husband may ask, &#8220;Is this true?&#8221; We may say, &#8220;Surely it&#8217;s true. We didn&#8217;t have a chance to tell you this.&#8221; Then the husband would make the decision to smash this idol into pieces, and we would encourage him to do so right away. This is an example of what it means to nourish and cherish our spiritual children. Eventually, we can lead the new believers to go with us to another home for a group meeting.<p>The ecstatic way, the &#8220;crazy&#8221; way, will always make people happy. It always cherishes people. The God-ordained way revealed in the Bible saves us from any formality and religious background. But we have to be filled up. We should not go out with a &#8220;flat tire.&#8221; All of our &#8220;four tires&#8221; must be full of air. We need to be like a ball full of air. If someone touches us, we will &#8220;bounce&#8221; over them.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>Now we need to consider how to have the group meetings. As we have said, we Christians should be &#8220;crazy&#8221; all the time. We should be &#8220;crazy&#8221; with the Lord, filled up with His Spirit and His word. Then we will attend any meeting in a &#8220;crazy&#8221; way. We should not go to a meeting like a &#8220;flat tire,&#8221; without being filled with the Spirit and the word. This is why we need to have a new revival every morning so that we can be revived persons. Then we need to continue to exercise our spirit to be overcoming and victorious every day. We need to attend every meeting as revived persons.<p>The meeting should actually start before we leave our home. We should go to the group gathering singing and praying. While we are on the way to meet with the saints, we may sing, &#8220;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail&#8221; (Hymns, #551). When we arrive at the meeting place, what shall we do? According to our old way, we would sit there in silence and wait for the meeting to begin. But the &#8220;crazy way&#8221; is not like that. We should start the meeting in our home, singing and praying in the car on the way. When we come into the meeting place, we should continue to pray. When others come, they can join our prayer.<p>After the prayer, someone may share that a certain brother lost his job today. This is fellowship. Then there can be some prayer for this brother. The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding. After praying for the brother who lost his job, someone may ask what his profession is. Then another brother may say that his company needs such a person. This is an example of mutual care and shepherding. We have to practice this. This will make everyone living. Everyone feels free and has the boldness to share something.<p>Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked. No one should be assigned to answer these questions. Everyone should answer them. Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question. He may say, &#8220;Formerly I did not know what the cross was. But just recently a brother told me that it was a means used by the Roman government to put to death the worst criminals.&#8221; His answer is a short teaching. Another brother may continue by saying, &#8220;The cross was where the Lord Jesus was crucified. He was crucified there on behalf of us to take away our sins.&#8221; Then he may read one verse referring to this. Another brother may say, &#8220;When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us.&#8221; He would also give a verse to support what he has shared. Another brother can add something more by saying, &#8220;Today we have to experience the cross of the Lord Jesus. We can experience the cross by applying the death of Christ on the cross to our situation. When we are about to lose our temper, we need to call on the Lord. This brings us into the death of Christ in the Spirit.&#8221; This brother may then continue to share something further concerning the experience of the cross of Christ.<p>A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting. Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life. In this way there will be the mutual teaching of the truth and the experience of life. This does not mean that we do not need books to help us. We still need the help from books such as Truth Lessons and Life Lessons. In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life. Then when we are in the group meeting, we can refer to these books when we answer something. We can tell the new ones that they can read more concerning a certain truth at home in their spare time. When we take this way, the answers to the questions in the group meeting will become very rich. This way gives the opportunities to every attendant to use their knowledge and their experience to answer questions. If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth. All of us start the meeting in our homes, and everyone in the meeting is a leader and a teacher.<p>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25. When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting. This is because some of the Jewish brothers had left their Christian meeting and had gone back to their Judaistic gathering. In our present situation, we need to have a meeting that is our own meeting. We should not forsake our own meeting. We must help all the saints to realize that the group meeting is their own meeting.<p>The group meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints participate. Everyone can start the meeting in his home, everyone can fellowship, everyone can intercede, and everyone can render the mutual care and the shepherding. In this way everyone in the group will be exercised to shepherd one another. It is impossible for a few elders to shepherd all the saints in the church. But if the church is divided into group meetings, all the saints will shepherd one another. The group meetings are so easy and so delightful. There is no hardship or any heavy burden on anyone. If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened. But in the organic way, no one is overburdened. Everyone is ecstatic. When a question is raised, we can all answer, listen, and learn.<p>Hebrews 10:24 says that we should incite one another to love and good works. It is by this &#8220;free way,&#8221; the organic way, of having group meetings that we can incite one another. In this way there is no limitation, no assignment, and no designation. The meeting is left open to everyone. All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ.<p>If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting. They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it. If this brother has some helpers assigned to him, they may not even help to bear the burden because they know that this brother is bearing the main responsibility. This brother has to consider what kind of lesson he should give. He has to pray to get a subject from the Bible with the help of books like Truth Lessons or Life Lessons. Sometimes such a teacher would be exhausted. He may not know what lesson to choose, what lesson is applicable at that time. When we take the God-ordained way of meeting, however, we leave this matter to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions. In one meeting many questions can be asked and properly answered. In the old way, the riches within only one brother are dug out, but in the God-ordained way, everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches. These are the riches of the Body of Christ. This kind of mutual teaching incites us to love and good works. This is the ecstatic, joyful way to have a group meeting. No one is overburdened because we all bear the burden.<p>The group meeting gives everyone the chance to speak. Spontaneously, everyone will participate in the speaking. Humanly speaking, no one can learn a language unless they practice speaking it. By the saints practicing to speak in the group meetings, everyone will learn how to prophesy. It is also profitable for some brothers to act as tutors in helping the saints to prophesy. Perhaps there is a new one among us who has been saved for only six months. A brother who is functioning as a tutor can encourage this new one by telling him not only to speak by answering questions in the group meeting but also to go to the Lord&#8217;s Day meeting of the church to speak, to prophesy. He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord&#8217;s Day meeting. His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ.<p>When we prophesy in the larger meetings of the church, we should not speak too long. Each one should prophesy for no longer than three minutes. The brothers who are tutors can observe the saints who prophesy and help them by coaching them. They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord&#8217;s Day to give them some helpful adjustments. This is like a coach teaching the players. One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be &#8220;crazy&#8221; with and in the Spirit and the word.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE WAY TO GO ON</h2><p>I would like to say a word to the elders. In our locality we should not do anything in haste. At the present time, some of the saints may not feel good about changing our way of meeting from one person speaking to a meeting of mutuality with all prophesying. They may be concerned that nothing will come out if we begin to meet in mutuality and that this will result in a drop in attendance. We need to consider the situation of the saints in our locality. We have to fellowship with the saints who are concerned and with the whole church. We also have to help the prophesying in the larger church meetings. The elders need to do a supporting work. If the church is having a prophesying meeting and nothing substantial comes out in forty minutes, the elders need to take the last fifteen minutes to speak a word to the saints. When we first begin to take the way of meeting in mutuality, this may be needed. A word from the leading ones in the final fifteen minutes will fill in the gap. The elders should exercise to be very flexible in bringing the church into this God-ordained way of meeting. As long as we have a will, there is a way. We have the Bible and many spiritual books that open up the Bible. These can help us to get ourselves prepared to give a word full of the riches of Christ. In some meetings there may be no need for the elders to supply something special to support the meeting. But when we begin to take this way of meeting, the elders and certain gifted ones need to get themselves prepared and need to be on the alert to supply a word full of the riches of Christ if the meeting is empty. This God-ordained way will open up the mine for the riches of Christ to be released.<p>Every group meeting is a digging meeting, and every district meeting, the larger meeting of the church, is a meeting to exhibit, to display, the riches. If we have fifty meeting together on the Lord&#8217;s Day, I believe five will be very rich. They will always have some riches in their pocket. If the others in the meeting do something to support and to supply the meeting, that is sufficient. If they do not, some of the rich ones can function to make up the lack. Therefore, no meeting will be empty.<p>It would be very difficult for other Christian groups to take the way of all speaking in mutuality. The Bible has not been opened up among them, and they have very few books to help them get into the riches of the Bible. But with us it is different. Many of the brothers and sisters in the recovery have the riches of Christ, and they have the capacity to release these riches for the building up of the Body. They need to be given the opportunity to practice to release their riches. If we will be faithful to take the Lord&#8217;s ordained way, I believe that all the local churches will be brought on the right track within ten years. By that time the &#8220;custom&#8221; of the new way will be built up in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>Furthermore, we should not despise anyone or any church if they do not fully practice the ordained way. Criticism and gossip obviously are absolutely not from the Spirit. Whether a brother or sister takes this way or not, they are still in the hand of the Lord. Whether a church takes this way or not should be left to the Lord. All of the churches and all of the saints are members of the Body of Christ in the recovery. Whether someone takes this way or not should not concern us. But since we have seen something, we should be faithful to practice what we have seen.<p>We must also realize that the gifted persons have to perfect the saints. The best way and the best place to perfect the saints is in the group meetings. If you are a gifted person, you should go to a group meeting to perfect the saints in that group. When you are with them, you can observe them and get to know everyone&#8217;s condition. Then you can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them. Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20) and that he admonished each one with tears (v. 31). He taught the saints not only in the big meetings but also in the homes and one by one. This is a detailed, fine work. It takes much labor and time. If I am a person who has the portion, the capacity, and the gift to perfect the saints, I should attend a group meeting all the time. As everyone speaks in the group meeting, I will get to know their real situation. Then I can go to their homes to spend personal time with them. Perhaps I could visit one person each week to have a direct talk with each one of them. This is for the purpose of promoting each one&#8217;s gifts, to develop his capacity, and to enrich his speaking. We can render much tutoring by this one-on-one contact. In this way the saints will be perfected face to face by some of the gifted persons. This labor will not be in vain because some saints will be perfected. Eventually, the saints will be perfected to do what the gifted persons do. Furthermore, the gifted persons will produce gifted persons.<p>In the old way, there was not such a result because the way was wrong. In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function. Then the riches of Christ will come out of every member of His Body. We will perfect one another, and everyone will be perfected. It may be that in a five-year period, we will perfect someone. But after this, he will perfect us because he has learned more. By this God-ordained way, everyone will be perfected, everyone will be useful, and everyone will have the development of his capacity in the divine life. Every saint will be occupied, and no time, energy, or persons will be wasted. The numbers will increase, and the life and spiritual knowledge will grow. We need to cooperate with our Lord to take His ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</body></html>
