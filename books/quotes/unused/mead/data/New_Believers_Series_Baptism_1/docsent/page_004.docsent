   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Baptism Being for the Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the day of Pentecost, the apostles told the Jews, "Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Protestants have difficulty accepting this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this verse is the plain word of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is strange that the emphasis of the apostle's word is not upon faith but upon baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Was the focus of Peter's message in Acts 2 on persuading men to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No. Does this mean that Peter's preaching was inferior to ours? The Bible tells us that the most crucial thing concerning salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How could Peter have left this out?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps he could ignore other doctrines in his message, but how could he not speak about faith?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, he did not speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, he spoke about baptism, and the Holy Spirit pricked the heart of those who listened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What about us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We say that faith alone is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We think this is orthodox Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet Peter said, "Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter spoke only of baptism because those who listened to him were the ones who had killed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fifty days prior to that, they were crying, "Take this man away."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These were the same people who were shouting and crying in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now they needed to be separated from the rest of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why it was not necessary to speak to them about believing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They only needed to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That would be sufficient for them to get out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as they were baptized, their relationship with that corporate body would be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as they were baptized, they would leave that corporate body and their sins would be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They would no longer be part of that corporate body; they would be out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why Peter said, "Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The act of baptism brought them out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as they came out, all problems were solved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need to realize that you were originally in the world and that you were an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since you have come out, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to confess before God and before men that you have come out and have nothing to do with that corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are through with it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the main teaching on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this point your mind needs to be directed by God's Word, not by Protestant theology.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. Baptism Being for the Washing Away of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us consider the case of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ananias came to Paul and said to him, "Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name" Acts 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul was the foremost and greatest teacher, prophet, and apostle of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Was there a little error in his experience?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes we preach the right doctrines but have the wrong experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What would happen when we gave our testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What would happen if others did the same thing we do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The testimony of a teacher is very important because it may mislead others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Could it be that the experience of the foremost teacher of Christianity was wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please take note of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It says that baptism can wash away one's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Catholics quote this verse and regard it as a personal matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The error of Catholicism lies in saying, "If you are baptized, your sins will be washed away."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, they claim that a death-bed baptism can wash away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They do not realize that the significance of this matter is not before God but before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Formerly, Paul was a man in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After he had believed in the Lord Jesus and had seen Him, he needed to rise up and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The moment he was baptized, his sins were washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The moment he severed his relationship with the world, his sins were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are a Christian secretly and are not baptized, the world may still consider you as one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may say that you are saved, but the world will not admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may say that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, but they will say that they have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once you get into the water, they will see it; they will know that you have believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, why should a person be so foolish as to get into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The moment you are baptized, you are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Water baptism is a severance of one's relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For instance, in Kuling of Fukien there is a strong tradition of idol worship every fall; everyone is required to donate some money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a person merely says that he has believed in the Lord, others will not believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the moment he is baptized, they will know that he is no longer one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, baptism is the best way to free oneself from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you want to be freed from the world, you must be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You must tell the world, "My relationship with you is over."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By doing this, you come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Baptism is an open testimony, and we should not be afraid to let others witness it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unbelievers can also be present during our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, "We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There were too many spectators."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even the baptisms of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost were not that orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The issue is not whether a meeting is orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Of course, it is not good to be disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But all the brothers and sisters should know what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we baptize someone, we should let the whole world witness what we are doing.</S>
