   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE ATTAINING THE OUT-RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY BEING FILLED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Philippians Paul uses certain unusual expressions that are not found elsewhere in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of these expressions are "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ," "the power of His resurrection," "the fellowship of His sufferings," and "being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although these expressions may be familiar to us, we may not understand them adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider another peculiar expression, "the out-resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This refers to the resurrection that is outstanding, not the ordinary resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This resurrection is like graduation with highest honors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hundreds of students may graduate at the same time, but only one is the valedictorian, one whose graduation is outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may call this kind of graduation the outstanding-graduation, or the extra-graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Paul wrote this Epistle, he probably realized that he would soon be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believing that there would be a resurrection at the time of the Lord's coming back, he was assured that he would participate in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he desired to attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead, the outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PAUL'S DESPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Philippians 3:11 Paul says, "If by any means I might attain unto the out-resurrection from among the dead" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>. The words "by any means" reveal that Paul was desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was like a runner in a race who is desperate to be first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul's concept was that of a race in the Olympic games.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By any means, he wanted to arrive at the goal of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to have this sense of desperation infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be desperate to attain the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FILLED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A student becomes valedictorian by doing outstanding work in his studies and by being filled with all he has learned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to be valedictorian, you must be the graduate most filled with learning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, in order for Paul to attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead, he had to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, many young people are good at shouting and releasing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when the Lord Jesus comes back, what will count is how much we have been filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible to shout and release the spirit and yet be short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is nothing wrong with shouting and releasing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But inwardly we need to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will be concerned with the degree to which we have been filled with Him, not with how much shouting we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How much Christ have you obtained?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much Christ has filled your being?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are filled with Christ, then you will be qualified for the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not only shout in the meetings, but be filled with Christ and express Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God does not want shouting or release.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants His Son, Jesus Christ, to be wrought into our being to become our life and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ must be our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we receive of Christ, the more qualified we shall be to attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul's concept in Philippians 3 is that of gaining and obtaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As I have pointed out, the word obtain implies both experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, Paul wanted to experience Christ and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means he desired to participate in Christ, to partake of Christ, and to have Christ wrought into the fibers of his being.</S>
