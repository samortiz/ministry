   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has appointed authorities in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the family there are husbands, parents, and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Above us there are rulers and officers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church there are elders and workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each deputy authority has his own requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we will consider the requirements for these different deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF VARIOUS DEPUTY AUTHORITIES Concerning Husbands</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible teaches the wife to submit to the husband and the husband to exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, there are requirements which the husband has to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 5 mentions three times that the husband has to love the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has to love his wife as himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although there is such a thing as authority in the family, those who are in authority should fulfill God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The requirement of a husband as a deputy authority is to love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a pattern for the husband's love for the wife Christ's love for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as Christ loved the church, husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The love that a husband has towards his wife should match that of Christ's love towards the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for a husband to maintain his authority in representing God, he must love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning Parents</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Children should obey their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as deputy authorities, parents also have their responsibilities and requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that parents should not provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although parents have authority over their children, they have to learn to control themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They cannot say that since their children have been begotten and are being raised up by them, they can treat them at will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created us, but He does not treat us at will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He gives everyone a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, parents should not provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people dare not do certain things before their friends, students, subordinates, or relatives, but they readily do them before their children without any hesitation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The greatest thing parents need to do is to exercise self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have to control themselves through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Parents can deal with their children only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their authority over their children is for the purpose of educating them only.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have to warn and nurture their children with the teaching of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no sense of domination or punishment here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A parent's heart should be for education, not for punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning Masters</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Servants should be obedient to their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But there are requirements for those who are masters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A master should not intimidate his servants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He should not threaten them or be angry with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will not allow an authority to behave in an unrestrained way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He must fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both the servant and the master have the same Master in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A master has to remember that he himself is under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although others may be under him, he also is under authority, even God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why he cannot be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more a person knows authority, the less intimidating and threatening he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to learn to be meek and loving, always having a heart for perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a necessary attitude for one to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a deputy authority only knows to threaten and judge others, he will come under God's judgment sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, a master must learn to walk with fear and trembling before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning Rulers</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should submit to the authority of rulers and officers over us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot find a teaching in the New Testament concerning how to be a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has given charge of the world to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has not given it to the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the New Testament God gives no indication that Christians should be rulers in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in the Old Testament there are cases of men serving as civil servants Psa 82 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of those in position and power, God requires righteousness, integrity, fairness, and compassion on the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the proper principle for those who are executing authority in public office.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man who is over others should not try to uphold his own standing; instead, he should do his utmost to uphold righteousness.</S>
