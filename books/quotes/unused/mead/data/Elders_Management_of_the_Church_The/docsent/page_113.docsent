   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The central work in the management of the church by the elders is to coordinate the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, to manage is to coordinate, and to coordinate is to build.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders' work of managing the church is to coordinate and build up the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where there is real management, there is real coordination, and where there is real coordination, there is real building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have said much about the management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The central goal for speaking about this matter is to speak about coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason we stayed on the matter of coordination for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of time, I spoke only sixteen points.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Strictly speaking, there are many more lessons to give on coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, the sixteen points given must be explained by practical, real, and detailed examples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the fine points and detailed considerations in our work occur in the matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, we have to help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This one item alone has much for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our following the Lord and serving Him, we often encounter many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, there are problems with family, with jobs, with education, with marriage, with spiritual progress, with the study of the Bible, and with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are too many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How should we solve them all?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If possible, we should spend much time to illustrate them point by point with examples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only mention them in brief now and will leave it up to the brothers to probe into them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Strictly speaking, the one item of solving others' problems will alone require much practice for many sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, a person listening to the gospel may have a girlfriend.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now this person is saved, but the girl has not yet believed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The question is brought before the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How are you going to solve this problem?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders cannot merely say: "Brother, just pray!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course he has to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But you have to show him a way that fits his present condition and that does not contradict the biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has to pose no hindrance to his future following of the Lord and not put him in difficulty with his family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a very easy thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Take another example.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some young people may be graduating from high school.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are zealous in pursuing the Lord, and they come to you for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What kind of university should they attend?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Should they study medicine, or should they study engineering, or some other subjects?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that this is a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times, their choice has much to do with their future growth in life and their usefulness in service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot say something rashly and expect them to act rashly!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may be a little spiritual and say: "Go and pray!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord will lead you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to touch their real condition, bring them to the Lord, and solve the problem before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some brothers had two wives before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How should they solve this family problem?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How will this affect such a one in his service to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What attitude should he take in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What kind of stand should he have?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many questions such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the elders cannot open a way for others in these matters, and cannot solve their problems, they are short in management.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brothers and sisters will suffer and will be like children without the care of their parents.</S>
