   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HUNDRED ONE PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many prayers are not answered because our faith is too big!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God requires faith only as large as a mustard seed and no larger.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may feel that we have little or no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may be before Him with no confidence in our own faith, in fear and trembling, and with no assurance whatever, but this does not matter, because God answers according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our feelings have nothing to do with whether or not God will answer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may feel that we have great faith for a thing, or we may feel that we are weak and full of doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But these are nothing but feelings, exterior and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>True faith will always be like a mustard seed, deep within our spirits, springing out of brokenness and weakness, but knowing that God is God and that He has His perfect plans and ways and that He will accomplish His work no matter what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is faithful, and He must ever act in faithfulness, according to His character and His sovereign will.</S>
