   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPREADING OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DESCENDING DEW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although in verse 2 the King James Version speaks of ointment, most other versions use the Hebrew word for oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This oil refers to the anointing oil described in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That anointing oil is a compound ointment formed by blending four spices with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Aaron, his sons, the tabernacle, and everything related to the tabernacle were anointed with this ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Psalm 133, this ointment, this compound anointing oil, was upon a person, Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have pointed out that, by contrast, the refreshing, watering, and saturating dew was on a place, the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Neither the anointing oil nor the saturating dew moved quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dew did not fall down like rain; it descended, came down, in a gradual way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, the ointment did not actually run down upon Aaron's beard; it spread upon his beard and then went down to the skirts of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Hebrew root means to strew, as to strew over a surface.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It also means to spread, like to spread a cover, a bedspread, over your bed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the anointing oil upon Aaron's head spread upon his beard; it did not swiftly run down upon the beard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gently and slowly, the ointment spread.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle the dew came down upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our hymnal there is a hymn about "showers of blessing" #260 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such spiritual showers are somewhat Pentecostal in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have a greater appreciation for the spreading of the ointment and the descending of the dew than for the showers of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Showers are not related to oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The genuine oneness is constituted of the spreading ointment and the descending dew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ANOINTED WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have pointed out emphatically that real oneness is the mingling of the processed God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although this is revealed in the New Testament, we do not see in the New Testament the way to practice this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way to practice this mingling is in Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ointment in verse 2 is a type of the processed Triune God who today is the all-inclusive compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Exodus 30, the anointing oil is a compound formed by blending four spices with a hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This compound typifies the all-inclusive Spirit who is the processed God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this compound Spirit we have not only divinity, but also Christ's humanity, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the compound Spirit is the processed God with the divine attributes, the human virtues, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church life this compound Spirit is continually anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ointment can be compared to paint, and the anointing to the application of the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you paint a chair, you may put on one coat of paint after another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the compound Spirit anoints us, He "paints" us and the "paint" is the very Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this "paint" we have the humanity of Christ, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also have Christ's divinity and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As all these ingredients of the ointment are applied to us, we are "painted" with the processed Triune God and with all the elements in the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper church life is a life in the oneness which is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we remain in this oneness, we are "painted" with the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we are "painted" in this way, the more our natural constitution, temperament, and disposition are eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What remains is the mingling of the processed Triune God with our uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the oneness.</S>
