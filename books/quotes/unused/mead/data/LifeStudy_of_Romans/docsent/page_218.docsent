   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GRAFTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because neither the illustration of the vessel nor that of married life picture anything organic related to God s dispensation, Paul goes on to use a third illustration the grafting of one tree to another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 11:17-24 Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of grafting, the branches from the wild olive tree and the cultivated olive tree grow together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each tree has its own life, but now these lives grow organically together and have one issue.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A surgeon may do what is called a skin graft.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this procedure healthy skin is transplanted from one part of a patient s body to a wound or burn elsewhere in his body to form new skin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the graft is completed, the transplanted skin will grow organically with the tissue to which it has been grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This growth is possible because both the skin and the tissue have life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The organic element in the life enables them to grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Romans Paul uses the illustrations of vessels, married life, and grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The illustration of the vessels shows that we are God s containers with God as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The illustration of marriage shows that a man and a woman with different minds, emotions, wills, personalities, characters, and dispositions are joined to form one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The illustration of grafting shows that two lives are joined and then grow together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A stanza in a hymn written by A. B. Simpson Hymns, #482 speaks of grafting:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This the secret nature hideth,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Harvest grows from buried grain;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A poor tree with better grafted,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, when Mr. Simpson wrote this hymn, he had Romans 11 in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not believe that A. B. Simpson would teach that the Christian life is an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this hymn, he realized that it was a grafted life, a life in which two parties are joined to grow organically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GRAFTING OF SIMILAR LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for one kind of life to be grafted to another, the two lives must be very similar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, it is not possible to graft a branch from a banana tree to a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, it is possible to graft some branches from a poorer peach tree to a healthy, productive peach tree, for the lives of these two trees are very close to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may apply this principle to the dispensation of the divine life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine life cannot be grafted with the life of a dog because there is no resemblance whatever between these lives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But because our human life was made in the image of God and according to the likeness of God, it can be joined to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although our human life is not the divine life, it resembles the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, these lives can easily be grafted together and then grow together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the line of the hymn by A. B. Simpson, the poor tree is grafted to a better tree to gain a richer, sweeter life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life of the poor tree does not disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it grows together as one unit along with the life of the rich, sweet tree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once again we see that this is not an exchanged life, but a grafted life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>UPLIFTED THROUGH GRAFTING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, according to the natural law ordained by God, it is not the poor life that affects the richer life, but the richer life that affects the poor life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, the rich life will swallow up all the defects of the poor life and thus transform the poor life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, when we are grafted into Christ, Christ swallows up our defects, but He does not eliminate our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, as He swallows our defects, He uplifts our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He uplifts our mind, will, emotion, and all our virtues.</S>
