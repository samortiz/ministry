   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we want to see more concerning the revelation of Christ as a man in the Old Testament prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>E. Being like a Refuge, a Covering,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Streams of Water, and the Shadow of a Massive Rock</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah prophesied that Christ, as a man in His humanity, would be like a refuge from the wind and a covering from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land, and at the same time He would reign according to righteousness as the King, under whom there would be righteousness, protection, and enjoyment, in the millennium Isa 32:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A tempest is a violent windstorm frequently accompanied by rain, snow, or hail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is not only a refuge from the wind but also a covering from the tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this prophecy will be fulfilled in the millennium, we need to realize that today the church life is a minor millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this minor millennium, we can enjoy Christ as the reality of so many rich items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>F. A Man of Sorrows</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 53 unveils that Christ was a man of sorrows v. 3 in His humanity to be our Redeemer in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>G. Sitting on the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ezekiel saw Christ, as a man in His humanity, sitting on the throne of God above the firmament 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan's realm is in the air, the firmament, but Christ as a man in His humanity is sitting on the throne that is in the third heaven, above the territory of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Stanza 1 of Hymns, #132 says:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the man by God exalted,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With God's glory He is crowned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to history Christ's sitting on the throne should be after His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the Old Testament Ezekiel saw Him sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is similar to the apostle John's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He saw the New Jerusalem, but the New Jerusalem to him and to us is not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire Bible needs our study so that we may have the proper interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible was first written, later translated, and then interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The many different truths in the Bible can be likened to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our study of the Bible, we have endeavored to put together all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today I believe that I have finished the work of putting the pieces of the entire Bible together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When all the pieces are put together properly, we can see a clear view.</S>
