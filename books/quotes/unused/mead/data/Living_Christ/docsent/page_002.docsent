   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4-5; 16:9; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BIBLE AND GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God that we have the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Bible is a complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although it consists of sixty-six books, it has only one revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This revelation is a complete whole; it is complete in its entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this complete revelation there is one central point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although believers throughout all the ages have read the Bible extensively, most of them have missed the central point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The central point in the Bible is very clear; it is Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is not only life, but He has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the central point of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ becomes our life to fulfill God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has an eternal will, and in this will He has a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His plan is to gain a group of people to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For man to express God, it is necessary for God to enter into man to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider this: If God does not enter into man and live out Himself through man, how can God express Himself, and how could man express God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you have seen a variety show featuring two performers, one of whom speaks while the other acts out the gestures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Similarly, I can hide behind a brother, while he acts out whatever I say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that this is an expression of me, but it is actually not so; he is expressing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only way for me to be expressed through him is for me to enter into him and live out myself through him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, this is impossible for me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot enter into him, much less can I live out through him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, I cannot express him, and he cannot express me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This, however, is the very thing God can do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God can work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, God has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only God is able to do this; no one else can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has wrought himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God's central point in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God becomes our life, He is Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Genesis 1 reveals to us that God created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to insist on asking why He would create man thus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two answers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first answer is that God had to create man to be like Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have your picture taken, and it does not turn out to be like you but looks like a tiger or a demon, this picture does not express you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, since God wanted man to express Him, He had to create man to be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the Bible, man is a "photograph" of God because man was created according to God's image and likeness for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second answer is that God created man to be like Him so that one day He could enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have something that needs to be contained, you need to find an identical container, such as a box that is of the same size and shape as that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, if the thing to be contained is round, you need to find a round box.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the thing to be contained is square, you need to find a square box.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best illustration of this is a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A glove is made entirely according to the shape of a hand so that the hand can fit into it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One time I saw someone making a glove with one section for the thumb and one other section for the four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was a mixed-up item.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I greatly disapproved of what I saw, for that was not a glove but a mitten.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A proper glove must have separate sheaths: one for the thumb, one for the index finger, one for the middle finger, one for the ring finger, and one for the little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything must be according to the shape of a hand so that the hand can properly fit into it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God created man in His image and after His likeness for the same reason.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God wanted to one day enter into man and feel comfortable in man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God desires to enter into you that He may put you on and make His home in you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, Genesis 2 reveals that in the creation of man, God breathed the breath of life into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The breath of life was a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Bible the breath of life became the spirit in man, because the word breath in Genesis 2:7 is translated into spirit in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, the word spirit in Proverbs 20:27 and the word breath in Genesis 2:7 are the same in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows that the spirit of man is the breath of life that was breathed by God into man in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When God created man, He used two materials.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One material was physical, that is, the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God used the dust of the ground to form the body of man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The other material was spiritual, that is, the breath of life; it was intangible yet living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The body made of dust was tangible, but not living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the breath of life entered into man, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, man has a body on the outside and a soul inside, and within the soul there is a spirit, which is the organ for him to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's creation of man was very special.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First, God created man to be like Him that man might have His image.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Second, God created man with a spirit as a receptacle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, when you consider a man, on the one hand, he has an image that is the image of God; on the other hand, he has a spirit within him that is solely for the purpose of receiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This spirit may be likened to the receiver installed in a radio for the sole purpose of receiving radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We know that in Genesis 1 and 2 God had not yet practically entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man was still an empty vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although man had the image of God outwardly and was a receptacle to receive God inwardly, God had not entered into him yet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After God created man, He placed this empty vessel before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you read and understand the Bible, you can see that the tree of life signifies God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The tree of life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's intention in putting man before the tree of life was for man to receive God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moreover, at the outset the Bible speaks clearly that the way to receive God is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We know that if we want to receive anything into us, we need to eat it, but the things we eat must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In other words, if you eat a piece of stone, it will not have any organic reaction within you; it is inorganic and cannot be absorbed into your bloodstream or cells.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But if you eat something nutritious, an organic process will take effect within you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For example, a few hours after you eat a piece of fruit, it will become your cells and eventually will become you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is often said that you are what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whatever you eat, that is what you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you eat mangoes, then you will smell like a mango.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I sometimes tell the Americans that they smell like cows because they drink so much milk and eat a lot of steak.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, if you eat beef, you will become a "cow."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This kind of speaking does not sound nice.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, if we eat Christ, we will become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Do you believe this?</S>
