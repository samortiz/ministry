   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus expressed this idea more explicitly at the time of Lazarus's death: "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever" John 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus is not only the resurrection but also the life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of us believe that He is the resurrection but forget that He is also the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We only know that after we die He will resurrect us, but we forget that while we are living He wants to be our life to save us from dying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus told us of these two kinds of work, but we only believe in one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said, "He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what believers of the past two thousand years are going to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But He also said that there will be a group of people who "lives and believes into Me," who will "by no means die forever."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not know how many thousands have believed in God and have already passed away, but God's Word says that some will "by no means die forever" not that some will be resurrected, but that some will "by no means die forever."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have no reason to say that we must first die and then be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the second coming of the Lord Jesus is already near, why should we have to die before then and wait for resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why not look to Him to rapture us at His second coming so that we may be totally delivered from the power of death?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord tells us that not only is He the resurrection to many, but also the life to some.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although it is marvelous to be resurrected from the dead as Lazarus was, this does not mean that there is no other way to overcome death other than resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said that there is another way to "by no means die forever."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Originally, we were appointed to fall into the gloomy valley of death, but God has built a "pontoon bridge" for us to get to the heavens directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This pontoon bridge is the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If some wish to be raptured and if the time of rapture is indeed near, then God would desire that we learn how to overcome death and be among the number who will be raptured alive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before rapture, the last enemy to overcome is death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the cross the Lord Jesus fully overcame death, but God desires that the church would experience His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all feel that we are at the end of this age and that before our rapture the Holy Spirit is now leading us to wage the last battle against death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan knows that his time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is trying his best to frustrate the believers from being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, the children of God today experience many physical attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of such frequent physical attacks, they become accustomed to breathing in the atmosphere of death and lose the hope of being raptured alive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believers do not know that this is just the challenge of the enemy to frustrate them from being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a believer has truly received the calling of rapture, he will spontaneously develop a fighting spirit against death; in his spirit he will feel that death is a frustration to his rapture that must be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The devil was a murderer from the beginning John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His job is to murder.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The goal of all that Satan does to the believers is to cause them to die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the end time he deals with God's children in a special way: he wears them out Dan 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he can add a little anxiety to a believer's spirit, put a little more fear and worry in his mind, give him insomnia one night, and cause him to eat less and become overworked at other times, he has succeeded in bringing in an invasion of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although a drop of water is powerless, a repeated dripping over a period of time can wear away a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Knowing this, Satan uses little worries, anxieties, and neglect to wear out the saints.</S>
