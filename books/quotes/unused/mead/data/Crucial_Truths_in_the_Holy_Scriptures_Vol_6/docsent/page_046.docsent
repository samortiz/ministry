   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Christ bore God s judgment on the cross, He rose from the dead, ascended, and poured out the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Holy Spirit was poured out, the church was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the time of the church s existence, there has been judgment in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s judgment on the cross is one kind of judgment, and His judgment within the church is another kind of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s judgment in the church is called the judgment of the church because it is carried out through the church on sinning believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most people are unaware of this matter, and most believers ignore this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This judgment, however, is an important link in God s government, and it is also a part of God s government in the church.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever there is a sinning believer, the church should judge him without delay.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the early days there was a sinning believer in the church in Corinth, but the church did not judge him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostle Paul had to rebuke them for not removing the one who committed the deed of fornication and for not judging him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever there is a sinful believer in the church, the church should judge him without delay.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church s judgment upon sinning believers is within the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not need to be taken to the apostle or even to another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the early days the apostle commanded the church in Corinth to judge the sinning brother by judging him themselves, that is, by judging him within their own local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that the judgment of sinning believers is within a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Judge the Local Church</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The apostle told the church in Corinth to judge the sinning brother among them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, concerning the judgment of sinning believers, the church that judges is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This judgment is carried out by the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not carried out by the apostle, by other people, or by another group.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the church judges sinning believers, the church judges believers who commit blatant sins and refuse to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The apostle spoke of those who are called brothers in the house of God even sisters are brothers being fornicators, covetous, idolaters, revilers, or being drunken or rapacious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With such ones we are not even to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to judge and separate ourselves from them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The six sins that the apostle lists are very offensive to God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are blatant and immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With the exception of idolatry, even unbelieving Gentiles condemn these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, any brother or sister who commits any of these sins and who refuses to repent should be judged by the church and removed from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church must judge such a one by removing him in order to avoid corruption inwardly and to care for the church s name outwardly.</S>
