<h1 class="title">The Kingdom and the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18-19; 18:17-18; 13:44-46;<br />
Rom. 14:17; Rev. 21:2, 9-10, 18-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Bible first presents the kingdom and thereafter presents the church; the presence of the kingdom produces the church&mdash;Matt. 4:23; 16:18-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life of God is the kingdom of God; the divine life is the kingdom, and this life produces the church&mdash;John 3:3, 5; Matt. 7:14, 21; 19:17, 29; 25:46:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom is the realm of life for life to move, rule, and govern so that life may accomplish its purpose, and this realm is the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The gospel brings in the divine life, and this life has its realm, which is the kingdom; the divine life with its realm produces the church&mdash;2 Tim. 1:10.</li>
		<li>The gospel of the kingdom brings forth the church because the kingdom is the life itself, and the church is the issue of life&mdash;Matt. 4:23; Acts 8:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom is the reality of the church; therefore, apart from the kingdom life, we cannot live the church life&mdash;Matt. 5:3; 16:18-19; Rev. 1:4-6, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5&mdash;7) is the content of the church life; without the reality of the kingdom, the church is empty.</li>
		<li>Since the kingdom life issues in the church life, as we live corporately in the kingdom life, we spontaneously live the church life&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>A believer who does not live in the reality of the kingdom cannot be built into the structure of the church&mdash;Eph. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Without the kingdom as the reality of the church, the church cannot be built up&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is brought into being through the authority of the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The keys of the kingdom are given to make the building of the church possible&mdash;v. 19; 18:18; cf. John 20:23.</li>
		<li>When the kingdom of the heavens is able to assert its authority over a company of believers, those believers can be built up into the church&mdash;Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The genuine church is the kingdom of God in this age; today the believers live the kingdom life in the church&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19; 18:17-18; 13:44-46; Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 4:20; Eph. 2:19; Col. 4:11; Rev. 1:4-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Each time the Lord Jesus spoke of the church, He mentioned it in relation to the kingdom; this indicates how intimately the kingdom and the church are related&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19; 18:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Romans 14:17 proves that the church in this age is the kingdom of God.</li>
		<li><em>The kingdom of God</em> in 1 Corinthians 4:20 refers to the church life (v. 17), implying that in the sense of authority, the church in this age is the kingdom of God.</li>
		<li>The term <em>fellow citizens</em> in Ephesians 2:19 indicates the kingdom of God, the sphere wherein God exercises His authority.</li>
		<li>What Paul and his fellow workers were doing in the gospel work for the establishing of the churches was for the kingdom of God&mdash;Col. 4:11.</li>
		<li>The word <em>kingdom</em> in Revelation 1:6 reveals that where the church is, there the kingdom of God is; the church represents the kingdom.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church as the kingdom, we are under the kingdom&rsquo;s rule, government, discipline, and exercise&mdash; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5.</li>
	<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, at the same time we are both in the kingdom and in the church, in the treasure and in the pearl&mdash;Matt. 13:44-46.</li>
	<li>Although the church today is God&rsquo;s kingdom, we are in the kingdom in reality only when we live, walk, and have our being in the spirit, not in our natural man&mdash; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
	<li>As those who are under the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we need to live a kingdom life in the church, growing and developing in the divine life until we reach maturity&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; 2 Pet. 1:5-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church brings in the kingdom; the work of the church is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 6:10; 12:22-29; Rev. 11:15; 12:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church was brought into being for the purpose of bringing in the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19; 18:17-18; Rev. 1:6, 9; 11:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church&rsquo;s responsibility is to perpetuate Christ&rsquo;s victory and to bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;12:10-11; 11:15.</li>
		<li>The work of the church on earth is to bring in the kingdom of God; all the work of the church is governed by the principle of the kingdom of God.</li>
		<li>The church is responsible for bringing heaven&rsquo;s will down to earth and for carrying it out on earth&mdash; Matt. 6:10; 7:21; 12:50.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church, which comes into being under the rule of heaven, by reason of her submission to the heavenly rule, deals with God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;16:18-19; Eph. 6:10-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of spiritual fighting&mdash; Matt. 12:22-29.</li>
		<li>The responsibility of the church is to continue the warfare Christ fought on earth; the church must continue the victorious work that Christ has carried out against Satan&mdash;Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8b; Col. 2:15; Psa. 149:5-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church should pray to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 6:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The coming of the kingdom is not automatic; if there is no prayer, the kingdom cannot come.</li>
		<li>The prayer of the church is the most effective means of curbing Satan&mdash;16:19; 18:18.</li>
		<li>The church must be the outlet of heaven, allowing heaven&rsquo;s authority to be expressed on earth&mdash; 16:18-19; 18:17-18.</li>
		<li>Genuine prayer is a joint labor with God to bring His kingdom to the earth and to carry out His will on earth; hence, prayer is a spiritual battle&mdash;6:10; 2 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 6:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the kingdom and the church, the treasure and the pearl, become one entity&mdash;Rev. 21:2; Matt. 13:44-46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The kingdom produces the church, the church brings in the kingdom, and the ultimate issue is the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-10.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is a combination of the treasure and the pearl&mdash;vv. 18-21.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem combines in itself both the kingdom and the church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the bride, which according to Ephesians 5 is the church&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-10.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is a city, which speaks of God&rsquo;s government, and in this center of government is the throne of God&mdash;vv. 2, 10; 22:1, 3b-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who always put God&rsquo;s kingdom before them&mdash; that which touches God&rsquo;s will and His enemy&mdash;are the most useful workers in the hands of God&mdash;Matt. 6:33; 7:21; Col. 4:11; Matt. 25:21, 23.</li>
