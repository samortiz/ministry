<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCHES<br />
IN TAIWAN TO GO ON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You, and we humble our hearts before You. We look to You. We bow before You and confess that we are small and incapable. Lord, the entire church is seeking You, waiting on You, and expecting You to appear to us. Speak to every one of us in our hearts. We do not want to be in outward activities without touching You. Lord, we give ourselves to You. We thank You that You are all our offerings. We are joined to You, and we lay our hands on You as our burnt offering.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask You to spread within us, to gain more room within us, and be glorified in us. We seek You for the churches in Taiwan and for Your glorious recovery. Remember, Lord, that this is Your move and Your testimony. Have mercy on us that we would be able to keep up with You.</p>
<p>Lord, take us forward to pray for Your churches and for all the saints so that none of us would miss Your grace or lose Your presence. Cause us to live in Your presence every minute and even every second. Cause us to be in the reality of daily living one spirit with You. The greatest fact in the universe is that we are one spirit with You. May even the youngest among us experience this fact. We testify to the universe that we are one spirit with the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and reigning Christ. We have received grace to say that for us, to live is Christ.</p>
<p>Lord, supply us with grace every minute and every second so that we can live You every day to be Your testimony on this island. Make us Your witnesses. We praise You as the essential Spirit who transforms us inwardly and as the economical Spirit who anoints us without. Grant us to be filled with You inwardly and outwardly so that You would be our reality in everything. Open the heavens to us and make our sky bright and transparent. May we see the throne. We want to touch Your throne and be connected to Your throne. We want all of our activities to be under the throne and under its direction. Lord, You charged us to go to disciple all the nations because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You. You are our Head, and You are also the Head of all things to the church. As the Head, You are for us and with us. We testify to the heavens and to the earth that we are for You and unto You. We honor You as the supreme Being and exalt You as Lord. Bless Your church. Bless this country for the sake of Your gospel and Your truth. Be glorified so that all men will know that Jesus is Lord. May every knee bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord. We give all the glory in heaven and on earth to You. We announce to the universe that You are our Lord, our Savior, and our Head. We worship You, we serve You, we love You, we exalt You, and we live You every day. You are our all in all. May all love and praise be to Your honorable name. Amen.</p>
<p>In the preceding message we spoke about every home being open for the gospel. From now on our focus will be to open not only the homes of the strong saints but also the homes of the weaker saints and of the dormant saints. We look to the Lord&rsquo;s grace to lead us in life and to cause us to rise up corporately so that every household would be for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>This is an age of education. In Taipei alone there are at least four to five thousand students in junior high school, high school, technical college, university, and graduate school. These campuses are fishing ponds for the gospel. There are also many brothers and sisters who are on these campuses either as students or as teachers and professors. This environment has been arranged by the Lord, and it gives us the best opportunity to gain the young students. We need to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s work and preach His gospel to students before they enter society, that is, while they are still being educated in school.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that man has three parts: spirit, soul, and body. However, today&rsquo;s society cares only for the body and the soul. The Olympic games are good, but they are good only for the physical body. The educational system cares only for the soul within man, paying particular attention to the mind within the soul. However, no one pays attention to the spirit of man, his innermost part. Therefore, when the church preaches the gospel, it focuses on the spirit of man. We thank the Lord for giving us the opportunity to edify the young ones and to enable them to be complete. They need not only a strong body and a healthy soul but also a proper spirit.</p>
<p>The young people need God. If they never receive the Lord&rsquo;s gospel or hear the Lord&rsquo;s truth, the center of their human existence will not be strong. It is our responsibility that they hear the truth. We must pick up this responsibility and go to every junior high school, high school, technical college, university, and graduate school to ensure that the young people have the opportunity to know the Lord&rsquo;s truth and receive His gospel while they are receiving their education. We must consecrate the entire church to the Lord for the campus work.</p>
<p>We would welcome any young saint, especially between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, who can join the campus work. We hope that all the young brothers and sisters will consecrate themselves to the Lord and to the church after they graduate from college and give a minimum of two years in full-time service for the Lord&rsquo;s work. During these two years they would be trained in reading the Bible, and they would also go out to the campuses to contact students and lead them to salvation. They would also serve the Lord in the church. After the two years of training, they will be able to see how the Lord is leading them.</p>
<p>If the Lord will give us such grace, after the university and college students among us fulfill their military service requirements, they can give two years to God as a kind of firstfruit for the Lord&rsquo;s church. On the one hand, they will equip themselves in the truth by spending four hours every morning to get into the Word and receive help from the Life-study messages. On the other hand, they will spend time in the afternoons to pray and to contact people for the gospel, especially on the campuses. We believe that through these young brothers and sisters, the Lord will bless the students on the campuses. In order to advance the campus work, we will also need some experienced co-workers to take the lead in the campus work. They should be led by the Lord and do business for Him through the furtherance of the gospel at the universities, technical colleges, high schools, and junior high schools.</p>
<p>We worship the Lord that the environment and situation on the island of Taiwan are favorable to the campus gospel work. The people enjoy freedom, transportation and communication are convenient, the level of education is high, the economy is good, society is peaceful, and people&rsquo;s hearts here are wide open. This provides us with an excellent opportunity. If you are not able to give your entire life to be full time for the Lord, you can give at least the first two years after you graduate from college. You can offer them as your firstfruit to God. During those two years, God will perfect you and will manifest something in you. In this way, you will know what to do with your future.</p>
<p>There are nearly six hundred brothers and sisters all over Taiwan who have decided to serve the Lord full time. Most of them are young people, and a few of them still need to complete their education. This is the Lord&rsquo;s grace. However, this number is not enough to be able to send saints to all the campuses in Taiwan. Hence, we must receive a burden and pray. We must receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading to participate in this matter.</p>
