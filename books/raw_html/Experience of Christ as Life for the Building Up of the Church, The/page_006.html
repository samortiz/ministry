<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GROWTH IN LIFE BY THE SOUL-LIFE BEING DEALT WITH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 10:10; 3:5-6, 14-15, 29-30; 6:44-45; 7:17; 14:21, 23; 21:15-19; 12:25</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD COMING THAT WE MAY HAVE LIFE<br>FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE BRIDE</H2><P>In John 10:10 the Lord said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly." We may know this verse and may even have some experience of it, but we need to ask, "Why did the Lord come that we may have life?" The Lord came that we may have life for the unique purpose that the bride might be produced.</P><P>We can prove this by John 3. In this chapter the words spoken by the Lord are short and simple, yet they are profound. The Lord came that we may have life, but how can we have this life? John 3 shows that we can have life by being regenerated, born again. It is through regeneration that we receive Christ as life. The way to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit (v. 5). "Water" was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation. "Spirit" is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. Water deals with all the negative things of our past, burying everything of our old history. Water buries the old life, and the Spirit brings in the new life.</P><P>The life which we have received by being born again is a life for us to enter into the kingdom of God (v. 3). Let me give an illustration to help us understand this. On the earth there are a number of kingdoms. There are the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, and the human kingdom. The only way to enter into a particular kingdom is to have the life of that kingdom. We entered the kingdom of humanity by being born of human parents. Without having been born of human parents, we could never have seen, or entered into, the kingdom of humanity.</P><P>In the universe there is another kingdom, the kingdom of God. The only way that we can enter into this kingdom is by being born of God. There is the kingdom of man, the kingdom of humanity, and there is the kingdom of God, the kingdom of divinity. We all have been born into the kingdom of humanity, but we need to enter into the kingdom of divinity by being born again of God. Nicodemus thought that to be born again was for him to return to the womb of his mother (v. 4), but to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit. This means to have our old history buried in the water and to have a new beginning, a new life, a new history, a new day, a new start of life, by the Holy Spirit. We have entered into the kingdom of God by a new birth, by regeneration, by being born of water and the Spirit.</P>
