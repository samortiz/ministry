   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SEVEN CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 2:1 3:22 I. SUMMARY REMARKS ON CHAPTERS TWO AND THREE A. The Seven Churches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seven churches mentioned in these two chapters were actual churches at the time of the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the description of the conditions of these churches portrays their actual situations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet, at the same time, these seven churches represent the seven stages of the church, and their conditions also portray the general condition of the church in different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, this should not be taken in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are merely saying that the church following the apostles' time was more like Ephesus and the church of the second stage was more like Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, the condition of the church following the apostles' time bears a resemblance to that of the other six churches as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Seven Messengers</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every epistle is written to a messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have already studied who these messengers were.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope that the Lord will raise us up so that we may become messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although every epistle is written to a messenger, it also speaks to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, these epistles concern every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Seven Ways of Presenting Himself</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In every epistle, our Lord says something concerning Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, what He speaks concerning Himself corresponds to the condition of each church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, Ephesus is a church which has fallen from love, so the Lord manifests Himself as the One who walks in the midst of the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Smyrna is a suffering church, so the Lord presents Himself as the One who resurrected from the dead so that they would be willing to be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pergamos is a worldly church; thus, the Lord appears to them as the One who has the two-edged sword which is able to cut off the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thyatira is a corrupt and adulterous church; therefore, the Lord manifests Himself as the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, with which He is able to search and judge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sardis is a dead church; therefore, the Lord presents Himself as the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philadelphia is a church that faithfully holds to the truth; thus, the Lord is seen as the One who is holy and true and who opens the door wide to them for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Laodicea is a church filled with human opinions; thus, the Lord presents Himself as the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. The Meaning of the Names</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of the Seven Churches</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "Ephesus" means "loose."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the condition of their love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "Smyrna" means "myrrh," or "suffering."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the age when the Roman Empire persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Pergamos" means "high tower," "marriage," or "union."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During this period, the Roman emperor, Constantine, joined himself to Christianity, and the church secured a position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Thyatira" means "she sacrificed tirelessly."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the rising up of the priesthood during the age of Roman Catholicism, in which idol worship began to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may be considered as the darkest and most corrupted age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meaning of the word "Sardis" is "restoration."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the age of the Protestant church; her spiritual condition was so weak that it was as if she were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Philadelphia" means "brotherly love."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A hundred years ago the church was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A small number of Christians left the denominations, joined together in love, and wholeheartedly kept the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word "Laodicea" means "the opinions of the people."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the condition of the opinionated church today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>E. Seven "I Know's"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every epistle has the words "I know."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both our conduct, whether good or bad, and our condition, whether sad or joyous, are known by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord does His best to praise the good, but He also severely rebukes the bad.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a preview of the Lord's righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>F. Seven Warnings</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since each church is in a different situation, the Lord warns each of them accordingly.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to maintain His testimony, the Lord desires to raise up overcomers in each church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, He gives special promises to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These promises are found in the following verses: Revelation 2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21.</S>
