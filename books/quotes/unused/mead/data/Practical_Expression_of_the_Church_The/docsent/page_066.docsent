   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NORMAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the normal way?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The normal way is not to use our human effort; nor is it to depend upon a revival campaign with a giant preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fruit-bearing is the outflow of life; so we must grow in life and also take the responsibility of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church should encourage every member to pray for the bringing in of new converts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should spend at least two or three hours weekly to take care of some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not right for a church to remain the same in number year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose that after five years we still have the same number.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we do not have the exercise of the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What do I mean by the flow of life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I mean that we must abide in the Lord and enjoy the riches of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we must be burdened for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must pray, "Lord, my daily life is to bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the Lord will give us a deep realization for two or three persons for whom we should care.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may know 50 persons, but at that time the Lord will burden us with only two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will pray for them, mentioning their names to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we need to seek the Lord's guidance regarding how to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps we will invite them to dinner along with some of the brothers and sisters; then there will be others to help in ministering life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers and sisters in the church should help one another in a mutual way in the matter of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not do this just once in a while, but constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should spend at least two or three hours weekly in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not expect a quick job.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by doing it steadily and constantly that we will see the results.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If every year each one would bring in one new convert, within a year's time the church would be doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And after another year, it would be doubled again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The young people should bring in one new one every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not too much to bring in one new convert in one hundred and eighty days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, it is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If each one could bring in two a year, by the end of the year, the church would be doubled twice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some may say that this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose then that each one brings in one every two years, or that two brothers bring in one each year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In six years, the church will have doubled three times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And you cannot say that it is too much for each one to bring in one every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What an increase there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must not trust in the big Gospel campaigns, we must trust in the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The increase of the church is the fruit-bearing, not a great campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a branch we must bear fruit, and one fruit every two years is so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>LIMITATIONS TO THE CHURCH'S INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The increase and fruit-bearing of the church can be greatly frustrated and limited by the disposition of the leading ones in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some leading brothers possess a natural disposition against having many people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They always like to have around 75 or 80 in the church, and certainly not more than 100.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They like to be a leader of a small number, not a large one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the number is too large, they feel they cannot handle it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why our natural disposition must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a city with nearly three million people like Los Angeles, how can we be limited to just 70 or 80?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should expect to see one day in Los Angeles more than one hundred meeting halls, with a thousand brothers and sisters in every hall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even that is not too many, for 100,000 is just 31/3 percent of three million.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not condemn those who bring in twenty, but lose eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you bring in twenty, and lose eighteen, you still have two left.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where are the ones you have brought in?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eighteen may have gone, but there are still two.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How many do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, I do not believe that many will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our disposition must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In some of the places I have visited, I have cried silently to the Lord, "Lord, be merciful to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have been here five years, and there is still no increase."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This simply has been due to the disposition of the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did not like to have so many.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were satisfied just with a moderate number.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord be merciful to us that we may never have such a disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some of the leading ones do not like to be so busy in taking care of new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And this kind of disposition restricts the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you know what the Lord told us?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He told us to go to the streets and the byways and force people to come in. We have to be aggressive in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A few things are very necessary for the church life: To walk and live in the spirit, to experience Christ as life, to take a firm standing on the proper, unique ground, and to bear fruit for an adequate increase.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If there is a vine with many branches, spontaneously fruit will be brought forth, and this will be the real increase of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am not against any Gospel campaign or any famous preacher, but the normal Christian church life is that of every member bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is unnecessary for the local church to hold a large campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a number of believers are meeting and fellowshipping together week after week, month after month, new fruit should spontaneously be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There may be no preaching, yet new fruit is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is exactly similar to putting our trust in all the members, not in the teachings and ministries, to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the same principle, to bear fruit, we must trust in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The leading ones of all the churches must be enlarged in their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is true that to have more people is a kind of trouble, but we must be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And the leaders must learn to share the responsibilities with others.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But again, this is a matter of disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some of the leading ones do not like to have others share the responsibility; they like to have everything in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This has to be broken if the church is to increase.</S>
