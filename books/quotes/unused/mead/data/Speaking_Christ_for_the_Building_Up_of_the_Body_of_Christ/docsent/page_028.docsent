   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BY EXERCISING YOUR SPIRIT ALL THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should speak by exercising our spirit all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times when we speak, we disregard our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the course of our speaking, we may only exercise our spirit when we come to a point which we prefer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our speaking, however, should not change like the seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we open our mouths to speak, we must exercise our spirits from the first word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, we are not qualified to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must speak all the way not only in our spirit but also by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is important and it makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To exercise your spirit does not always mean that you shout.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By your experience you know what it is to speak without the spirit, and you also know what it is to speak with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These points for our speaking require our exercise and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AVOIDING TELLING SEA STORIES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our speaking we should avoid telling sea stories.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some try to lay a foundation for the point they are trying to make by telling a long story, and many times they do this without hitting the subject of their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not need to tell these sea stories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To give a testimony is not to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In giving a testimony about your history with the Lord you may simply say three sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is enough to cover the entire story.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the listeners will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They will not be so heavily burdened with a long sea story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes the brothers may have to tell the person who is giving a sea story to stop and give time for others to share.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very hard and not so polite to stop someone while they speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This always hurts people s feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, everyone should consider that there may only be an hour and a half for many people to speak, and a sea story takes too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen some who speak in a lengthy way in every meeting they attend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems that they have no sensation of time; they only care for their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not outside of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must care for the hours, minutes, and seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must learn to be limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AVOIDING ERRORS IN TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must avoid errors in truth when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is very easy for us to be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I may make mistakes in my speaking, but I will not publish any message without polishing or revising it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this polishing and revising, I make many corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Learn to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not have the assurance in giving numbers or other details, you had better not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AVOIDING EXPOSING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Avoid exposing others in your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy for us to expose someone, even in our testimony, but it is altogether not profitable or helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It only damages the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AVOIDING ANGER IN SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must avoid anger in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are angry, you must not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking in anger kills the situation and kills your speaking spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes someone may interrupt your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This may easily make you angry, but learn to hold back your anger, and never speak in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At other times someone in the audience may ask you a very peculiar question while you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of peculiar question also stirs up people s anger.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some who listen to your speaking may not like it and may rise up and walk out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not be bothered or touched by that.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you are speaking, do not let anything bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not focus your attention on any distracting element in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Continue to speak in a pleasant way, avoiding anger in your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>AVOIDING LENGTHY SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Try to avoid lengthy speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This does not mean that you should speak in such a short way that people will have difficulty understanding you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your speaking should be very easy for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some brothers and sisters speak like they are sending a telegram.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is better to lengthen this kind of speaking, but if you speak too long, this is also not good.</S>
