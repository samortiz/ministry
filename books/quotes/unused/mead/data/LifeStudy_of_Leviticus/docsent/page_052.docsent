   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Releasing Our Spirit through the Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would experience and enjoy Christ as He is revealed in Leviticus, we should pray not in a mental way but by releasing our spirit through the word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will cause the constant word in the Bible to become the instant word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among Christians today, including us, there is a lack of enjoying Christ by releasing our spirit through the word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may learn many things and we may pick up different practices, but we still do not have the adequate exercise of our spirit in prayer with the constant word in the Bible to make it the instant word in our experience that we may enjoy Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If for a period of time we pray by releasing our spirit through the word, we will have the deep sense that the Lord Jesus is with us to supply us with whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ministering Christ to Others</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we daily enjoy Christ by releasing our spirit through the word and touching the Spirit, we will be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we will minister Christ to whomever we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if we do not actually mention Christ, we will minister Christ to others through our fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Enjoying Christ as the offerings is a matter of eating Christ that we may serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we eat Christ, the more we will be filled with Him and be satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will enable us to serve God and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Worshipping God does not require that we kneel or bow down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may worship God even as we minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a ministering of Christ to others is a real worshipping of God with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, we ourselves need to be satisfied with Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, enjoying Christ as the capacity to love others, we will minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For instance, on the one hand, we need to take Christ as our sin offering, enjoying His propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, we need to minister the Christ we have enjoyed to others, especially to weaker ones who are still living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through such a ministering of Christ, they will be supplied and enlightened to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, they will go on to be victorious over their sin and to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My burden in this message is that the saints in the Lord's recovery would know how to enjoy Christ actually and practically, realizing that He, a wonderful, living person, is our offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; He is the processed One; He is a man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is also our holy food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that He is the offerings becoming our food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is even our worship to God and the One within us who pleases God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our need today is to enjoy such a Christ that we may preach Him and minister Him to others.</S>
