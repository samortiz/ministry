   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE THREE THE VISIONS OF CONSOLATION AND PROMISE 2 Scripture Reading: Zech 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to chapter two of Zechariah, which is a very mysterious chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE VISION OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WITH A MEASURING LINE IN HIS HAND</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter Zechariah saw a vision of a Man with a measuring line in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and behold, there was a Man, and in His hand was a measuring line.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And I said, Where are you going?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And He said to me, To measure Jerusalem; to see how great its breadth is and how great its length is" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. A Man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This Man is Christ in His humanity as the Angel of Jehovah, the One speaking with Zechariah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1a, 2-3a; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>40:3; Zech 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. A Measuring Line</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The measuring line 2:1b signifies measuring in order to possess.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, when we buy land or cloth, we may first measure its length and width.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we measure the land or the cloth, we then proceed to possess it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. To Measure Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Man with the measuring line intended to measure Jerusalem for the purpose that Jehovah may repossess it Zech 2:2, 4b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jerusalem was given up by God for the seventy years of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the captivity, God came back to Jerusalem to measure it for His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This measuring is not only to know the size but also to know the condition and the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The measuring was done by a Man, not by an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An angel is unqualified to measure anything human, because he does not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only Jesus, who has both the divine nature and the human nature, is qualified to measure Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whereas the temple is the sign of God's house, the city of Jerusalem is a sign of God's kingdom for His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The city of Jerusalem was measured and was found to be without limit v. 4 . This indicates that the size of God's kingdom is the size of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the measuring has revealed two important matters: that God's kingdom is unlimited and that God Himself is the size of His kingdom.</S>
