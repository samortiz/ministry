LIMITED TO STEREOTYPICAL PHRASES</h2>
<p>Since the purpose of opening our mouth and praying in the meeting is to release our spirit, we should not be limited to the use of stereotypical phrases. Over the years we have unconsciously generated many stereotypical phrases in our prayers. As soon as we open our mouth, these phrases come forth. These phrases may sound nice, but they restrict the spirit. Hence, it is not easy for people to utter the feeling within them. Also, when new believers hear these prayers, they feel that they cannot match them. Thus, they become too timid to open their mouth. If we want to learn to pray and release our spirit, we must discard these phrases and simply follow the sense in our spirit when we utter our prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER NOT BEING LIMITED BY TOPIC</h2>
<p>We should not limit our prayer to a specific topic. Since the emphasis of prayer is on the exercise of the spirit, the topic is not the most important item. We can pray when there is a specific topic, and we can also pray when there is not a specific topic. Actually, there are many matters that can be the focus of our prayer. For example, the building of the church, the gathering of students during winter break, the release of the spirit, the blending of the spirit, and the fellowship in the spirit are all worthwhile matters for our prayer. Hence, it does not matter whether we have a particular topic but whether our spirit is released. If we are skilled in our exercise, we can always release our spirit and blend in spirit, no matter what the topic is. Often we feel that there is no topic, burden, or leading in regard to our prayer simply because we have not exercised our spirit. As we exercise our spirit, we will become more skillful in sensing a topic of prayer, and there will be opportunities for prayer in every meeting. As long as our spirit is living and we are diligent, we should not be concerned about a topic for prayer.</p>
<p>A lazy person sees little need to do anything, and even if he sees a need, his laziness keeps him from acting on the need. A diligent person, however, is altogether different. Wherever he goes, he will have a sense that many things need to be done. Similarly, if our spirit is living and we are diligent, we will feel that there are many things that need to be covered in our prayer. For example, when we go to a message meeting, we will feel the need to pray for the Lord&rsquo;s servant so that the Lord may release His word to the saints. This is a very good topic for prayer. Being diligent, we will look for a few saints with whom to pray. At the end of such prayer, our spirits will be released and blended as one. This kind of blending is so spontaneous. This can be practiced not only in a meeting but even when we are riding in a bus. If our spirit is living and diligent, those who ride with us on the bus will become a topic for our prayer. When we see those who are not saved, we will pray for their souls, looking to the Lord to save them. Thus, even riding the bus is an opportunity to exercise our spirit. As long as we are willing to practice and exercise our spirit, there will be an unending list of items for prayer. We should not be limited by prescribed topics. If we limit ourselves to a certain topic, our spirit will not be released.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVING THAT<br />
WE CAN RELEASE OTHERS&rsquo; SPIRITS</h2>
<p>When we pray, we must have the faith that our released spirit will touch and open up the spirits of others. Each time we open our mouth to pray, we should believe not only that our prayer will be heard by God but also that it will touch the spirits of the saints. Every person who exercises his spirit in prayer must have such faith. This again can be compared to playing soccer. As long as we are willing to put the ball in motion, others will follow. As soon as we open our mouth to pray, others will follow. Once our spirit is opened and released, the spirits of the saints will be stirred up.</p>
<p>I would ask the brothers and sisters to exercise diligently related to the points outlined above. We should all exercise to the extent that we know how to pray in spirit so that we can pray at any time and in any place with any person. We should exercise to the extent that we are not bound by stereotypical phrases or limited by prescribed topics. As soon as we open our mouth, our spirit will come forth and touch the spirit of others. We must learn this lesson. This is especially true for the responsible ones who need to take the lead to exercise. This is a basic exercise. We must make an effort to exercise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF PRACTICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Working First with a Few and<br />
Then Including Many</h2>
<p>When we practice, we must blend from the &ldquo;center to the circumference.&rdquo; We should not call all the saints together to practice blending in the spirit, because it will not work. We must begin with a few saints who have been blended and who are skilled in the release of the spirit, and then we can include some who have less experience in this matter. Gradually, everyone will be blended. Hence, the responsible brothers and sisters must first be blended together. After they are blended, they can include responsible ones from the small groups. After these are blended, they can return to the small groups and blend with the other brothers and sisters. Blending should begin with those who have a heart to blend and then gradually include others. Eventually, even those who have not been meeting for a long time will be included in this blending. In this way, the whole church will be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having More Prayer and Less Talk</h2>
<p>When we come together to blend in spirit, we should try our best to avoid unnecessary talk. Everyone should come for the purpose of praying. Whoever arrives first should begin to pray, and those who arrive later can join in the prayer. In short, as soon as a person comes, he should pray. There is no need for talk, because talking often kills the Spirit. If there is still time after we have prayed, perhaps there can be some fellowship in the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Open to Let the Spirit Come Forth</h2>
<p>Being open means to let our spirit come forth; it does not mean to speak frankly with others and to point out their wrongdoings. In these days we often speak of being open. However, some saints think that this means to speak forthrightly and to be willing to point out wrongdoings. This kind of &ldquo;openness&rdquo; only opens up a tomb and spreads death. The more that one speaks in this way, the more he is filled with death. We should never practice this. The openness that we speak of involves the release of the spirit. We should not close our spirit; rather, we should try our best to let our spirit come forth. When we are meeting together, our spirit should be open; when everyone&rsquo;s spirit is open, the saints will be blended spontaneously.</p>
<p>This is wonderful. When we pray with an open spirit, there is no need to point out the wrongdoings of others because everyone will see their own wrongdoings in God&rsquo;s light and receive correction from one another in spirit. When we begin to pray, we may have different opinions concerning a matter, but as we pray and our spirits are released, we will become of one mind. Actually, it is not that our opinions will automatically become the same but that we will become one in spirit. When our spirits are in one flow and fully blended, spontaneously we will be one and we will not be governed by different opinions. If we do not pray in this way and instead spend time talking about this and that, we will end up insisting on our respective views. Thus, our spirits will be further and further apart, and problems will definitely rise up.</p>
<p>We must exercise to pray with an open spirit. Saints who serve together should regularly pray and fellowship with an open spirit. Eventually, differences in opinion will be harmonized, problems will be eliminated, weaknesses and shortcomings will be exposed, and there will be a mutual burden and blessing. I hope that from this time forward, we will exercise in this matter in every meeting, releasing our spirits until we are blended. We should pursue this kind of exercise ourselves and lead others into this exercise as well.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
