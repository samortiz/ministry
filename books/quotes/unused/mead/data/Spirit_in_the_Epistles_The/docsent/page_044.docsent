   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPHESYING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And I fell before his feet to worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he said to me, Do not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>19:10</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The administrating Spirit is mainly for prophesying, so the administrating Spirit is also the prophesying Spirit, who is for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should never think that administration and judgment are only for administration and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of God's administration and judgment are for the testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you receive the enlightenment from the throne, are searched inwardly, and are judged, that is the time the prophesying Spirit testifies for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the administrating Spirit is the prophesying Spirit for the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And he the angel said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>22:6</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This tells us that God as our God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our God not in our soul but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is Spirit, and as such He is the God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the God of the spirits of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we want to understand the things of God as the prophets do, then we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not in spirit, we cannot have God as our God, nor can we understand the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SPIRIT AND THE CHURCH BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>22:17</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the end of Revelation, the Spirit and the church have become one, and they are speaking together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word spoken by the bride, the church, is the word spoken by the Spirit, and the Spirit speaks through the bride, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit speaks together with the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In summary, the Spirit in Revelation is in six aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, "I was in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, the Lord's speaking is the Spirit's speaking, and the Lord's speaking must be repeated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, the Spirit of the Lord today is the seven Spirits as the expression of the Lord Himself to enlighten us, search us, judge us, and burn us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fourth, the Lord as the Spirit is the prophesying Spirit for the testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fifth, God can only be our God in this Spirit, so He is the God of our spirits, the God of the spirits of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sixth, the Spirit speaks through the church; the church and the Spirit become one to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you put these six aspects together, you can see that today everything hinges on this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is by this Spirit that you can see the visions and understand the mysterious things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is by this Spirit that you can hear the words which were already spoken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, if you are a saved person, then you are certainly one who has first been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The seven Spirits of God first come to judge you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven Spirits of God are among the seven golden lampstands first judging His church, His household.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we fall behind in being judged, then it proves that we have been disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are judged last, we are the disapproved ones; if we are judged first, we are the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, we have the prophesying Spirit and can testify for the Lord in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we can touch God as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is the God of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the Spirit and we become one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit speaks out from within us, and our speaking here is by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, brothers, I feel deeply and believe truly that nothing in the New Testament is more important than the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, from times past to the present time, this Spirit has been mostly neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today most people pay attention to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, while some pay a small amount of attention to the indwelling Spirit, but no one has developed the matter of the indwelling Spirit as much, as richly, or as broadly as we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In these past few days what we have studied is just an outline.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Following this, you still have to spend time to study the details carefully and pray over them in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The words spoken by the Lord to us must be spirit before they can be life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But how can the words spoken to us by the Lord become spirit to us?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must turn them into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You take the word which you have read and understood and turn it into spirit, and it is in spirit that you will see the visions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the Spirit's speaking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord has already spoken the things in the Bible, but now in the Spirit He will speak them to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is when your inward being will truly seem to have seven lamps of fire burning and shining in it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Having been enlightened and searched within, you will see many things that need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you are judged in this way, the Spirit in you will become the testifying Spirit, the prophesying Spirit, who is for the testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You will also touch the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At this time the Spirit and you will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that we will truly have the practice, exercise, and experience of these matters.</S>
