<h1 class="title">THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED TODAY</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word refers to the messages that we give. In the past we paid much attention to the exercise of the brothers when they minister the word. For more than three, close to four, years I have observed and paid particular attention to the ministry of the word in the different localities. Many brothers still need to exercise when they minister the word. It is difficult to speak clearly concerning this in a few words. It seems as though there is no problem with the messages given from the podium. However, if we study our situation carefully, we will see that there is a big problem. Because of the shortage among us, I hope that we can gather all the serving ones together in the fall and spend some time to focus on the administration and building up of the church and on the ministry of the word. This shortage is especially evident in the church in Taipei. There is, therefore, a need to address these two matters.</p>
<p>The administration of the church and the ministry of the word are related. The ministry of the word is related to the administration of the church. It is difficult to build up a church if we administer but do not have an adequate supply of the word. The serious problems in the larger churches, especially the churches in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, are due to a weakness in the administration, the building up, of the church, and the ministry, the supply, of the word. It is difficult to say which is more important. Both are equally important.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ministry of the Word<br />
Producing Building Materials</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word produces building materials. In order to build a house, we must have materials; without materials we cannot build a house. The materials for the building of the church are produced by the supply from the ministry of the word. We should not think that if we have three to five thousand saints, we have materials for the building up of the church. Without the proper ministry of the word, every saint will become a problem. The more saints there are, the more problems there will be. An increase in the number of saints does not mean that there are more materials. The amount of materials does not depend on the number of people but on the supply from the word. A rich supply is needed for the saints to become useful materials. Hence, the materials for the building up of the church come from the supply in the ministry of the word. When the supply is abundant and rich, there will be materials for the building up of the church. Without the supply from the ministry of the word, even if there is a multitude of brothers and sisters, we will sense a lack of materials for the building up of the church. We have many brothers and sisters, but we lack building materials because of a shortage in the ministry of the word. The supply from the word is the source that produces materials for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large local church, because it has many saints. Hence, all the serving ones in Taipei want to know how to build up the saints. However, because there is a weak supply from the word, there are many saints but no materials. In other words, many brothers and sisters cannot become building materials and be built up together, because there is a shortage in the supply. In order to have building materials for the church, there is the need for a rich supply in the ministry of the word. When there is a rich supply in the ministry of the word, the saints will not merely be brothers and sisters; they will become materials for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Administration of the Church<br />
Being the Skill for Building</h2>
<p>The administration of the church can be considered the skill needed for building. Having materials does not necessarily mean that a house can be built. We need skill. There must not be a shortage in materials or in skill. If we do not have the proper skill, we will not be able to build even when the materials are prepared. For example, if we are skilled in carpentry, masonry, or ironwork, we will not be able to build anything with materials such as wood, stones, bricks, cement, reinforced bars, glass, and steel rods. Therefore, we must see that on the one hand, the urgent need today is the supply from the ministry of the word, and on the other hand, it is the administration of the church. One concerns materials, and the other concerns skill.</p>
<p>The administration of the church includes governing and management. To govern requires people or things to be placed under authority. To manage means that people and things are not merely placed under authority but are directed in an orderly fashion so that their function is manifested.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
