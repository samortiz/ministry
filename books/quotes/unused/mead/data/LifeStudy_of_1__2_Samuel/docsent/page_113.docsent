   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX GOD'S BUILDING HIMSELF IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO OUR BEING THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE METABOLIC PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:12-14a; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I would like to give an additional word on 2 Samuel 7:12-14a.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many readers of the Bible do not understand the significance of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we will see, these verses refer to the very thing that God intends to build up in His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, my burden in this message is to point out that, as a prophecy given in the way of typology, these verses speak of God's building Himself in Christ into our being through the metabolic process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TWO PERIODS IN THE MINISTRY OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Testament clearly reveals that there are two periods in the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, He ministered on the earth until He died on the cross for our sins to terminate the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He rose in resurrection and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There He became and still is the Minister of all the heavenly things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such a Minister, He is not in the flesh, for in resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now He is not only our Redeemer and Savior; He is also the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, 2 Corinthians 3:17 declares, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TRANSFORMED INTO THE SAME IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FROM GLORY TO GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Christ is the Spirit, He can dwell in us, and we can fellowship with Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should look to Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, opening to Him the three layers of our being our spirit, our heart, and our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we will spontaneously reflect Him as a mirror and gradually be transformed into His glorious image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, we will have the same image that He has.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is altogether from the Lord, the Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the Lord Jesus makes us like Him and even makes us Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we look unto Him, He impresses Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we become His reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we reflect is nothing less than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what the New Testament calls transformation.</S>
