   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here we must explain what human elements are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As far as content is concerned, the Bible is full of human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we remove the human elements from the Bible, not much is left of it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Human elements occupy a crucial place in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, the book of Galatians speaks of God s promise by referring to the story of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we removed Abraham s story from the Bible, we would not understand what God s promise is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God that redeems man from sin John 1:29 , and the Old Testament speaks of men repeatedly offering sacrifices of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From Abel s sacrifice in Genesis to the book of Leviticus with its many offerings, we find men offering sacrifices to God again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a picture of the Lord Jesus becoming the Lamb of God to propitiate for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consider the example of David in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He fought in battles and won.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He obeyed God, and he was a man after God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He prepared materials for God s house, and Solomon built the temple with the gold, silver, and precious stones that David had prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see David, and we see Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two show how the Lord Jesus fought the battle, how He won, how He ascended, and how He was enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the story of David and Solomon were taken away, we would not be able to see the Lord Jesus fully.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus is greater than David and Solomon Matt 22:43-44; 12:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the Lord Jesus came, there first had to be a David and a Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, we would not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider the example of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The details of this history are recorded in the Bible, including how Joshua led the Israelites into the land of Canaan and how they overcame the thirty-one kings of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the stories of Moses and Joshua were taken away, there would be very little left of the books of Exodus, Numbers, and Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we did not have the book of Joshua, it would be hard to understand the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These examples show us that human elements are present throughout the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One characteristic of God s word is that it is full of human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s word is not released through thin air; it is released through man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God reveals His word through man and events related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This makes His word simple, understandable, and comprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever God speaks, He speaks so that man can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s word is not merely something that God utters, but something that man can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not merely supernatural; it is also very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not merely spiritual; it is also human.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through its human composition we can understand what God is doing and, therefore, what He is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The book of Acts provides very little doctrine; it is primarily a record of the acts of the apostles under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter s actions became part of God s Word, and Paul s actions also became part of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The beginning of the church in Jerusalem became part of God s Word, and the beginning of the churches in Samaria and the church in Antioch also became part of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These events are not merely history; they are part of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through history, man acted out God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By means of history, man declared God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit reveals God s word through man by means of history.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s Word is full of human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a characteristic of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a book of creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a book of man acting out God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God s speaking is being carried out, acted out, and lived out by man, we have the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One basic principle of the Scripture is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man does not understand incarnation, that is, the principle of the word becoming flesh, it will be hard for him to understand the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s word is not abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not spiritual to the point that all human flavor is suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s word is not that distant; it does not remain in an unseen, untouchable, and unapproachable realm.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the beginning was the Word....He was in the beginning with God John 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet this Word became flesh and tabernacled among men, full of grace and reality v. 14 . This is God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His word tabernacles among men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to remember that the incarnation of the Lord Jesus unveils the basic principle of the ministry of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to understand the ministry of God s word, we have to understand the Lord Jesus incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is the ministry of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is absolutely heavenly, but it is not in heaven; rather, it is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is one hundred percent heavenly, but it is not without the flesh; rather, it is embodied in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is truly heavenly, but it is not devoid of human elements; rather, it is manifested through men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is very heavenly, but at the same time, it is seen and touched by men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the testimony of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First John 1:1 says, ...which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled....</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God s word can be seen, beheld, and handled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Consider the matter of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before the Lord came, no one knew what holiness was.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today, however, holiness is no longer abstract, because we can see holiness lived out on earth in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Holiness walked among men.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we see the Lord Jesus, we know what holiness is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The word becoming flesh means that holiness has become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We did not know what longsuffering was.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But today we see long-suffering in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God is love, but we did not know what this love was like.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today this love can be seen in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may think that a spiritual man does not smile or cry or that he must be devoid of all feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet when we see Jesus of Nazareth, we know the meaning of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If all we had was God s holiness, we would not know what holiness is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But now we can understand what it is because we have the holiness of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If all we had was the love of God, we would not know what love is.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But now we can understand what it is because we have the love of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If all we had was the longsuffering of God, we would not know what longsuffering is.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But now we can understand what it is because we have the longsuffering of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If all we had was the glory of God, we would not know what glory is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But now we can understand what it is because we have the glory of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If all we had was God s spirituality, we would not know what spirituality is.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But now we can understand what it is because we have the spirituality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the meaning of the word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When the word became flesh, glory became flesh, love became flesh, and longsuffering and holiness became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we touch this flesh, we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Jesus love is God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>His glory is God s glory, His holiness, God s holiness, and His spirituality, God s spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If all we had was God, we would not know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But now that we have seen the Lord Jesus, we can understand all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The principle of incarnation is a fundamental principle.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God s work on man and His communion with man are governed by the basic principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although we do not have incarnation in the Old Testament, we do see God moving in this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Although the incarnated One has ascended to the heavens now, God still operates according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God s work in man and His fellowship with man are absolutely based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Today God is no longer an abstract God, an ethereal God, or a hidden God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He has been incarnated; He has come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many times when we preach the gospel, we like to declare that our God has come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In the Old Testament He did not come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Psalm 18:11 says that He made darkness His hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Today God is in the light; He has come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He has revealed Himself in the light, and we can see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When God was hiding in darkness, we could not see Him or know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But today He is in the light, and we can see Him and know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He has come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He has come forth in the person of Jesus His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Incarnation is a very basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The content of God s word is full of human elements.</S>
