   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HAVING BEEN SHOWN A. To the Old Testament Saints</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The righteousness of God was shown to the Old Testament saints in God s passing by their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul uses this term passing by in Romans 3:25.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During Old Testament times, the sins of the people had not been taken away, but only covered by the expiating blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their sins were not carried away until Jesus Christ died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the sins of the Old Testament saints still remained, although they were covered with the blood of the type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God had to pass by their sins because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The blood of the type of Christ was shed in the presence of God, and the righteous God was compelled to pass by all the sins covered by that blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In passing by those covered sins God showed forth His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose I owe a certain person a billion dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it is impossible for me to pay this amount, I am bound by that person to pay him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, I have a friend who is a billionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My friend proceeds to tell both parties that there is no problem, that he himself will pay the full debt, and he writes a promissory note as evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the promissory note has been delivered and accepted, I must be released because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, the Old Testament saints owed God a tremendous amount, but there was a promissory note the blood of the expiatory sacrifice sprinkled on the propitiation cover which guaranteed that Christ would come to take away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This promissory note covered all the sins of the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ redeemed the promissory note when He died on the cross and paid the full price.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, because of His righteousness God had to pass by their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In so doing, He has shown His righteousness to the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the meaning of Romans 3:25.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. To the New Testament Saints</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s righteousness has been shown to the New Testament saints in God s justifying them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has justified us freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ and through the faith of Jesus 3:24, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since Christ has paid the price for our sins and has accomplished the full redemption to meet all of God s requirements, God, in order for Him to be just, must justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On God s side justification is by His righteousness; on our side justification is by His free grace as compared with justification by the work of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be justified by the work of the law we need to work, but to be justified by the redemption in Christ there is no need of our work; it is freely given by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not deserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ which meets all His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, God has shown His righteousness to the Old Testament saints in passing by their sins and to the New Testament saints in justifying them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s dealing with us today is not simply to pass by our sins, but to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>V. BOASTING BEING EXCLUDED</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of this, boasting is excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>None of us has anything of which to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have not been justified by the law of works, but by the law of faith 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This faith does not originate with us; it is of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ONE GOD JUSTIFYING TWO PEOPLES</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This one God justifies both the Jews and the Gentiles 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the God both of Jews and Gentiles 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In saying this Paul paves the way for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If God s dealing with people differed from one group to another, it would be difficult to have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, God has one way of dealing with all people, and this one God with His one way brings the different peoples together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, it is the one God who justifies us all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among us we have a number of Jewish brothers and sisters, and God has justified them in the same way as He has justified us, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The one God has justified all of us that we may be one as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God justifies the circumcision out of faith and the uncircumcision through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Notice the prepositions: the Jews, the circumcision, are justified out of faith; the Gentiles, the uncircumcision, are justified through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Jews have a position before God as His people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In spite of their unbelief and apparent uncleanness, the Jews still have the position as God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must recognize this and be careful how we refer to the Jews, for God will say of them, They are My people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Having the standing as God s people makes a great difference, and we need to respect it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Genesis 12:3 God promised to Abraham, the forefather of the Jews, that whoever blessed him would be blessed by God and that whoever cursed him would be cursed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God continues to fulfill Genesis 12:3.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whoever touches the Jews in the way of cursing will be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Throughout the past 25 centuries there has been no exception: every individual and nation, that has cursed the Jews has been cursed and everyone who has blessed the Jews has been blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the Jews are conditionally not right with God today, they are still the people of God positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Elsewhere in Romans Paul says that God s selection is irrevocable 11:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Jewish people are God s selection, and God s selection is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regardless of how unbelieving the Jews are at present, they still are the people of God positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, when God justifies the Jews, He justifies them out of faith, not through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why is it not through faith?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because the Jews have the position already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, when God justifies the Gentiles, He must justify them through faith because they are far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a great distance between the Gentiles and God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since the Jews, the circumcision, already have the position, they are justified out of faith; since the Gentiles are a great distance from God, they are justified through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is through faith that the Gentiles reach the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In both cases it is a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One God justifies us all.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both Jews and Gentiles are under one God and in one way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul s word in Romans 3:29-30 prepares the way for the Body of Christ in chapter 12.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whether we are Jewish believers or Gentile believers, we are one Body in Christ under the one economy of the one God.</S>
