   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE KNOWING THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON 2 THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is easy for people to say that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Bible says that the church is not only the Body but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The new man is different from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us use the physical body as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A body is simply a vessel to be used as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man, however, is not merely an organ; a man has a person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A body needs life, but a man needs a person in addition to life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life is different from a person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A plant has life, but it does not have a person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A man has not only life but also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past we saw that the church is the Body with Christ as its life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we did not see that the church is the new man with Christ not only as its life but also as its person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE REVELATION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says that the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul says that the Lord created the two the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the new man is not an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new man is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 16 continues, And might reconcile both in one Body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 15 says that the Lord created the two into one new man, not an individual man but a corporate man, and verse 16 says that He reconciled both in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Body is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, in chapter 1 the Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the church is not only the Body but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some believers say that while the Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ, it does not say that the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These believers say that before a person is saved, he was an old man, but after he is saved, he becomes new.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the new man refers to a saved individual, not to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without a clear foundation in the truth, we will be influenced by such talk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must guard against the schemes of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should ask such believers to read Ephesians 2:15 and ask them what the two refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they cannot answer us, we should tell them that the two refers to Jewish and Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the new man is composed of two peoples, Jews and Gentiles, the new man cannot refer to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Besides, verse 15 says that He created the two into one new man, not merely into a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Into a new man may be understood as each believer being a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, verse 15 clearly says one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 16 then says, And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians 1:22b-23a says, Gave Him Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These verses indicate that the Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the context, the Body also refers to the new man in chapter 2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we see this point, we will have a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to grow in life and be clear concerning the truth, and we must also fight the battle for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fighting for the truth is not something that we began.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the time of the church fathers, believers have been fighting for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Reformation began with Martin Luther s contending for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the whole world is in confusion, but the truth in the Bible is crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What do we mean by truth ?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here is an example: It is true that two plus two is four.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To say that two plus two is 3.99 is false; it is an error.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, to say that two plus two is 4.01 is also an error.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Truth stipulates that two plus two is four.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The truth in the Bible is very accurate and very exact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nothing can be more accurate than the thoughts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible as God s revelation, His speaking, is very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must locate the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Based on the Bible, we can say that the church is not only the Body but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Christians, we need to know how to present the truth to people; otherwise, we are useless to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must be able to render genuine help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Second Timothy 1:7 says, God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our spirit is a spirit not only of power but also of love and sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word sobermindedness indicates that our mind is clear and sober, not confused.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our spirit should be a spirit not only of power and of love but even more a spirit of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have love but are not sober, we will love in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, suppose I make a cup of coffee for a brother because I love him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, I add two spoons of spicy chilies to the coffee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he drinks the coffee, he will surely suffer; he may even get an upset stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, it is not adequate to have only a spirit of love.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We still need a spirit of power and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Power is related to our will, love is related to our emotion, and sobermindedness is related to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be loving in our emotion, strong and powerful in our will, and sober in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, it is not enough to have only life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If our mind is confused, we will not be able to help others with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every believer should lead others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we truly love the Lord and grow in life, the people we pray for will get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must be trained so that we can lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should speak the truth in life to bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Truth, life, and speaking are a threefold cord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have the truth and we have life, but we also need the ability to speak to others so that they are subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we have love without a sober mind, we will confuse our gospel friends, and they will be unreceptive to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, we need to learn to speak the truth.</S>
