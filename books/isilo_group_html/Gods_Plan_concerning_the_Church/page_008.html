<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for the believers to obtain the sonship, to be holy, and to be to God (Eph. 1:4-5). This purpose also involves making known His multifarious wisdom to Satan and his evil angels (3:10). In this chapter we will consider another purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church, which is to head up all things in Christ (1:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEADING UP ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Obtaining the sonship, being holy, and being to God solve the problem between God and man. Making God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom known to Satan and his evil angels deals with the problem of Satan. Heading up all things in Christ deals with the problem of all things. Thus, God&rsquo;s plan deals with the problem between God and man, the problem of Satan, and the problem related to all things. The church is the means by which God deals with every problem. Without the church, the problem between God and man, the problem of Satan, and the problem related to all things would not be resolved. The solution to these problems depends on the church. If the Lord opens our eyes to see how crucial the church is, our whole being will be subdued to understand that nothing apart from the church is the solution to these problems. This is revealed in Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Universe Cohering in Oneness</h2>
<p>In order for us to understand how God heads up all things through the church, we must know that the universe coheres in oneness; everything in the universe depends on this oneness. The source of the universe is one, the system of the universe is one, and the center of the universe is one. Everything in the universe coheres in this oneness, and this oneness is God. The universe coheres in oneness because the universe is out of God, and God is one. There was no chaos in God&rsquo;s creation; there was only harmony due to this oneness. Thus, the universe was one, and it was without chaos.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan Damaging the Oneness of the Universe</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Satan rebelled. From the time of his rebellion, the harmony of the universe was lost; it became chaotic. There is now chaos in the universe because the rebel Satan wanted to be head; he wanted to exalt his throne and to be equal with God (Isa. 14:12-14). When chaos entered into the universe, the order that was in the universe was lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Restoring the Oneness of the Universe</h2>
<p>God cannot allow chaos to continue in the universe. He will restore all things by heading them up. The oneness of the universe was originally the oneness in creation, but even though it became chaotic, it will be restored in oneness. This process involves God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life. The original oneness in creation was damaged by Satan, but God is restoring this oneness through redemption and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan Damaging by Death</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness in creation by death. Death has three spiritual consequences. First, death severed the relationship between creation and the Creator. Second, death caused creation to lose its function before the Creator. Third, death corrupted creation. When death severed all things from God, all things lost their center, and the oneness in creation was lost.</p>
<p>The center of the universe is God; therefore, the oneness of the universe is God Himself. When all things were severed from God, they lost their center, their oneness. This oneness is referred to as peace in Colossians 1:20: &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.&rdquo; When all things were severed from God, peace and harmony were lost. Peace and harmony are what the Chinese call accord. When all things have a proper relationship with God, they are not severed from God, and they are in accord because there is peace and harmony. This is the great oneness in the universe.</p>
<p>Because Satan brought death into all things and severed all things from God, all things are not at peace or in harmony; the oneness in all things has been lost. Many situations on earth prove that the peace and harmony among all things have been lost. For example, mosquitoes and fleas bite people. This proves that all things are not in harmony or at peace and that the oneness in the universe has been lost. When creation was severed from the Creator, it fell into death and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Restoring by Life</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness of the universe by death, but God restores the oneness by life. Only life can overcome death, swallow up death, and eliminate all the problems brought in by death. Based on His redemption, God&rsquo;s life restores the peace, harmony, and oneness that had been lost.</p>
<p>Formerly, we were dead in our offenses and sins and alienated from God (Eph. 2:1, 12). But one day God&rsquo;s mercy reached us. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross and through our believing, God forgave us our sins and imparted His life into us (v. 4; 1:7; John 3:16). When His life entered into us, it brought us into union with God. This life not only restores our relationship with God in creation; it also brings us into a life relationship with God. Through this relationship with God we are joined to Him (Gal. 2:20). As a result, our function toward God is restored. This function, which certainly includes serving God, exercising God&rsquo;s authority, and accomplishing God&rsquo;s purpose and will, primarily involves living out God (v. 20; Phil. 1:20-21). The corruption that was brought in by death is swallowed up by life. This results in full peace and harmony and brings in oneness.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of life, a recovery that involves transformation in life and nature. Satan&rsquo;s corruption brought his death into creation; God&rsquo;s recovery works His life into created man through redemption. Satan&rsquo;s death destroyed the oneness in creation; God&rsquo;s life recovers the oneness through redemption. Where there is no life of God, there is death, which is the absence of oneness. Wherever God&rsquo;s life flows, there is resurrection, which is oneness. Hence, wherever God&rsquo;s life is, there is oneness. Death is the opposite of oneness; it is the annihilation of oneness. Only life can swallow up death and eliminate death. Wherever God&rsquo;s life flows, death is swallowed up, and the oneness destroyed by death is recovered.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan concerning the Church &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
