<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">LIFE AND LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 20, 1934, morning<br />Place: Foochow<br />Scripture Reading: John 1:4</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Today believers need light. It is absurd for a child of God to have life but be without light. Those who have life should surely have light. John 1:4 says that in Him is life, and this life is the light of men. The life of the Lord is the light of men. When a man receives the Lord's life, he receives light. On the Lord's side, there is first life and then light. On our side, there is first light and then life. The spiritual depth that a believer possesses is dependent on the amount of light he has received.</p><h2 class="head1">LIGHT, REVELATION,<br />MANIFESTATION, AND VISION</h2><p>What does the Bible say about light, revelation, manifestation, and vision? Light is necessary to enlighten God's revelation and to make manifest what is hidden. A revelation is God's removal of a veil to show us something, as described in Revelation 1:1. After there is revelation, there is still the need for God's enlightening. Manifestation is the exposure of a revelation after it has been enlightened by the light. Finally, a vision is what we see after a revelation has been enlightened by the light. For example, Paul spoke of the vision he received from heaven (Acts 26:19), and Proverbs says that the people perish where there is no vision (29:18).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING LIGHT</h2><p>There are a few conditions for receiving God's light. First, a man must be in the proper realm before he can receive light. In other words, he must be in a realm where light can reach. For example, the light in a room can only enlighten that room; if you are sitting in the next room, you will not be able to read with the light from the adjacent room. The psalmist said, "In Your light we see light" (Psa. 36:9). We can only receive God's light in the realm where His light shines. Second, in order to receive light, we must have God's word. The psalmist said that the Lord's word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path (119:105). We must spend much time to read God's Word before we will receive light. Light is with God and not within man's heart. This is why the psalmist said that the Lord's word is the light unto our path. Third, in order to receive God's light, we have to draw near to God. We must be one who is near God, and one who draws nigh to Him, because only God is light. He is the source of light. When we are near Him and when we draw nigh to Him, we receive light. Luke 11 says that the eye is the lamp of the body (v. 34). The lamp does not have light in itself; it can only be a means through which light manifests itself. The eye is the means through which we see light, but light itself is God. If the eye is single, the whole body will be full of light (Matt. 6:22). A man must first establish an intimate fellowship with the Lord before he will see light.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWLEDGE AND LIGHT</h2><p>Knowledge is absolutely different from light. Those who have light surely have the knowledge, but those who have knowledge do not necessarily have light. There is a big difference between a blind man's knowledge of colors and a child's experience of them. A blind man may have the knowledge of colors, but he has never seen them. A child may not have the knowledge of colors, but he knows what colors are from his experience. It is a pity that believers today pay so much attention to knowledge instead of light.</p><p>The realization of sin is not a question of knowledge but a question of light. A student once said to Mr. Bengal, a famous Bible expositor, "I have recently discovered the doctrine of sin from the book of Romans." Mr. Bengal looked at him and said, "Do you mean to tell me that today is the first time that you have known about the doctrine of sin? By now you should have realized that your whole person is sin from your daily experience!"</p><p>I once asked a person who prayed frequently with Mr. Sparks, "What words are most often repeated in Mr. Sparks' prayer?" The man answered, "Lord! Let Your church see." What the church needs today is not more knowledge but more light and more seeing.</p>
