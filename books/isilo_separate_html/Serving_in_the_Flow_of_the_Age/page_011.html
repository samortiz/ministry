<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND STANDING ON THE GROUND</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO INSTRUCT THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
CONCERNING THE MATTER OF THE GROUND</h2>
<p>Over the years, &ldquo;Living in the spirit! Standing on the ground!&rdquo; has become a rallying cry among us. When Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan in 1957, he caused a problem related to the ground of the church. Since then, however, the matter of the ground has become firmer and clearer among us. Nevertheless, we must not forget to instruct the young people, who have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery since then, concerning the ground of the church.</p>
<p>The young people who have moved from the Far East to the United States in recent years have not been clear concerning the ground. There are some from Taiwan who have little realization of the importance of the ground. This shows that the brothers in Taiwan have been short in leading the saints. The responsible brothers in each hall should know who is migrating or studying abroad and fellowship with them before they go. According to my observation, however, the brothers in Taiwan seem to have done nothing. It seems as if no effort has been made to care for the brothers and sisters who have gone abroad. This reveals a shortage in our service. When saints go to the United States, they encounter Christian groups who are focused on gaining Chinese immigrants. These groups say, &ldquo;We are Chinese, we speak Chinese, and we have the Chinese culture. Come and meet with us.&rdquo; The brothers in Hong Kong and Taiwan should tell the saints who are going to the United States about such groups.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters in the Far East must care for the saints who are moving from the Far East to the United States. We must care for each one who goes to the United States, whether it is to reside or to study there. They need some understanding of the truth and also some realization concerning the efforts of such Chinese groups. I hope that the brothers in the Far East will understand and take this matter seriously. Our handling of this matter has been loose, and many people have been drawn away. Despite this history, however, we seem unconcerned. This is wrong. We should not neglect anyone who is moving from the Far East to the United States; instead, we should be cautious and give heed to this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK IN AMERICA<br />
NEEDING TO BE AMONG AMERICANS</h2>
<p>I cannot spend extra time to care for the brothers and sisters from the Far East in America because the environment does not allow for it. If I spend even a little time or strength to care for the brothers and sisters from the Far East, the Lord&rsquo;s leading among the American brothers and sisters will be affected. According to the burden that I have received from the Lord personally, I must spend a hundred percent of my time, energy, and strength to lead the American brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity in America, no preacher from China has ever succeeded in spreading the Lord&rsquo;s work in America. Preachers from China could only do a so-called Chinese work in Chinatowns. History also tells us, however, that a Chinese work in Chinatown has no future, because the older generation of Chinese does not understand English, whereas the next generation of Chinese understands the English language better than the Chinese language. Then, as they become Americanized, they leave Chinatown. As a result, a work in Chinatown cannot produce a succeeding generation. Such a work is gone after one generation, but Chinese preachers work in Chinatown because they have no way to work among the Americans. Nevertheless, as more and more students from the Far East begin to study in the United States, these preachers see an opportunity to work among the Chinese.</p>
<p>Currently, there are at least one to two hundred Chinese students in every state university; some even have three to five hundred. A percentage of these students is saved, and they meet with the denominations or free groups. When they arrive in America, they are unfamiliar with the place and the people, and they are different from Americans in their customs, social relationships, living, and habits. Consequently, they seek out their fellow countrymen, and as Christians, they seek out fellow Christians.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese, there are Christians who are sincere in their zealousness and willingness to establish Christian groups to preach to these Chinese immigrants. This is the basis of the Christian work among the Chinese in the United States. Some young Chinese preachers have gone to the United States to meet this need. Their work in America is actually a work among Chinese students. However, this work has no future because students are very mobile, and they move after they graduate. Thus, it is impossible to establish a foundational work in any locality. Americans do not intentionally shun the Chinese, but if a meeting is thirty percent Chinese, Americans may come to one meeting, but they will not return, because they think that it is only a Chinese meeting. This is a great problem.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that there are many Chinese coming to America, I was not sent to the United States to take care of the Chinese. If the Lord wanted me to work with the Chinese, He did not need to send me to America. The work with the Chinese should be done in Taiwan and Hong Kong. If I had gone to the United States to do a Chinese work, it would have been against the principle of the Bible. We must never seek to establish &ldquo;Chinese churches&rdquo; in the United States.</p>
<p>How can a Chinese preacher work among Americans? The United States is a Christian nation, and if the Americans know what we know, how can we gain them? When we contact the Americans, however, we are able to present things that they have never seen or heard. We are able to speak of the vision of the age that has been entrusted to us as the Lord&rsquo;s special testimony. This draws the Americans and opens up the door for our work among them. We need to devote our time to taking care of this open door. If we spend all our time with the Chinese, our work among the Americans will be affected, and our work in America will not be fruitful.</p>
<p>We are the only group of Chinese preachers in history who have been able to fruitfully work for the Lord among Americans. Now there is a testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in many of the major cities in the United States, from the East Coast to the West Coast and from the north to the south. Currently, there are over thirty local churches in America. Consequently, I do not have a burden from the Lord or the strength to train and lead the brothers and sisters from the Far East.</p>
<p>A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;It may have been necessary in the past to not work with the Chinese in the United States but now may be the time.&rdquo; I disagreed with this word because I cannot start a work among the Chinese in America. If I do this, our work among the Americans will rapidly decline. By God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we have been able to work and focus entirely upon Americans. This is a strategic development. The Lord led us to the United States, and this strategy has been effective. The results that we are seeing today are the issue of this strategy. It would be wrong for us to sacrifice thousands of Americans to care for the Chinese who are coming to America, because the Lord has not sent us to the United States to do a work among the Chinese.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
