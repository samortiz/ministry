<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Changing Their Names</H2><P>In his devilish temptation of Daniel and his companions, Nebuchadnezzar also changed their names, which indicated that they belonged to God, to names that made them one with the idols. The name of Daniel, which means "God is the Judge," or "God is my Judge," was changed to Belteshazzar&#151;"the prince of Bel," or "the favorite of Bel" (Isa. 46:1). The name of Hananiah, which means "Jehovah is kind," or "the favorite of Jehovah," was changed to Shadrach&#151;"enlightened by the sun god." The name of Mishael means "Who can be like God?" but his name was changed to Meshach&#151;"Who can be like the goddess Shach?" The name of Azariah, which means "Jehovah is my help," was changed to Abednego&#151;"the faithful servant of the fire god Nego."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Daniel Fighting the Battle<br>by Countering the Devil's Temptation<br>with Bold Rejection</H2><P>Daniel fought the battle by countering the devil's temptation with bold rejection (Dan. 1:8-13). Daniel did not play politics but was frank and bold.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Honoring Daniel's Fighting</H2><P>God honored Daniel's fighting, and Daniel and his companions became the overcomers among the remnant of God's defeated elect. The elect were defeated, but the young overcomers were victorious. Their victory was God's victory. Because of this victory God could boast and tell Satan that in the midst of Babylon, Satan's territory, God still had some overcomers, four young ones who were victorious over Satan's devices.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Apparently Being Defeated but Actually Preserving His Worship and Testimony</H2><P>Because of the captivity in Babylon, apparently God was defeated in His interests on earth. Actually He preserved His worship and testimony through the young overcomers among His defeated elect. In Catholicism and Protestantism today God has some overcomers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God Blessing Daniel and His Companions<br>with Knowledge and Insight</H2><P>God blessed Daniel and his three companions with knowledge and insight in all learning and wisdom, and He blessed Daniel especially with understanding in all visions and dreams (vv. 17-20). This blessing was God's way of indicating that He agreed with these four overcomers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. God Blessing Daniel with Longevity</H2><P>God blessed Daniel with longevity, so that he lived through the captivity of seventy years and saw the release and return of the captives from the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, after the fall of Babylon (v. 21; 6:28; 5:30-31; Ezra 1:1-5). From God Daniel received wisdom, insight, understanding, and longevity. With him and his companions we see the story of God's victory continuing on earth through the young overcomers. I hope that today as well there will be groups of overcomers who will be God's boast to Satan.</P>
