<H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>NUMBERS 31</H2><P>Verse 2:"Avenge the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people." May we overcome the enemy before we die.</P><P>Verse 3:"And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian." When we fight with Satan, we are avenging the Lord. Although God can avenge His own foes, He wants His people to work with Him.</P><P>Verse 7:"And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses, and slew every male." Obedience leads to victory.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and they took as plunder all their cattle, all their livestock, and all their goods." The enemy always tries to defeat us in the midst of our victory.</P><P>Verse 19:"And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever of you has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day." The most necessary thing after a victory is to purify ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ECCLESIASTES 7</H2><P>Verse 4:"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth." "The wise" feel this way, and "the fools" give themselves to indulgence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 9</H2><P>Verse 4:"We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work." Compare this with verse 5. "Day" refers to the time when Christ was on earth, whereas "night" refers to the time when Christ has left the earth.</P><P>Verses 8-9:"The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg? Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one." An inevitable condition after a person is saved is "to be like him and yet not be like him."</P><P>Verse 16:"Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them." This division lasts until today.</P><P>Verse 25:"Then he answered, Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see." This is the best testimony in the world.</P><P>Verse 29:"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from." They did not know where He came from, yet they "knew" that He was a "sinner" (v. 24)!</P><P>Verse 35:"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?" It is both inadequate as well as useless (Matt. 16) to believe that the Lord is a prophet (John 9:17). This is why the Lord also taught the man who had been blind that He is the Son of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 32</H2><P>Verse 5:"And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not take us across the Jordan." The rest of Canaan is a type of the millennial kingdom. But before one enters Canaan, he has to cross the river Jordan. Those who have not died with the Lord cannot reign with Him. The descendants of Reuben and Gad wanted to: (1) come into rest without crossing the Jordan, and (2) come into rest before the rest of the family came to rest. How inferior is the joy and pleasure of this world compared with that of the millennial kingdom!</P><P>Verses 33-42:"And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land all round. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, Bethnimrah and Bethharan, fortified cities, and sheepfolds. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, Nebo, and Baal-meon, (the names being changed), and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair. And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name." The land received by the two and a half tribes stood in opposition to that received by the other nine and a half tribes. But though this land was good, it was dangerous! Please read 2 Kings 10:32-33 and 1 Chronicles 5:26. Besides God's will, there is no rest in this world!</P>
