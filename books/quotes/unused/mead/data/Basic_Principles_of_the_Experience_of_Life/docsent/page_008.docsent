   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third step, or stage, in the experience of Christ is that Christ is formed within us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The experience of Christ is not the experience of humility, patience, or any aspect of good character.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All those things are not the real experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real experience of life is Christ Himself experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is regrettable that today there are very few Christians who can differentiate between Christ experienced by us and mere patience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Someone can be very patient or humble yet be one hundred percent without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To experience Christ as our patience or humility is absolutely different from simply having patience or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A brother may have been taught to be patient, and he may have made up his mind to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day and night, morning and evening, he tells himself to be patient, and he may even place a slogan or proverb in his room to remind him to always be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is mere patience and nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he succeeds in being patient, he may be very proud of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may say, "I am the most patient one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Look at that brother and sister; they are not patient."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, he is self-deceived, and he is also deceiving the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others may say, "Oh, look at that brother!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is so patient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is very much of the Lord and like the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a form of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not the real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The real experience of Christ is that day by day, even today, Christ meets us and we meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may not know anything about patience, but we do know something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have no intention to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our dictionary there may not even be such a word as patience, but we have it unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we go to the Lord, we may not feel or sense that we are patient.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we may confess, "O Lord, I do not love You enough, and I do not keep myself in contact with You moment by moment."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the brothers and sisters can realize that within us there is a divine, spiritual, and pleasant patience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The real experience of life is nothing other than the experience of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this spiritual dictionary there is only one word: Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is very easy to have this spiritual vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are not many words but only Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we pray to ask the Lord to help us in certain matters, such as loving others, being humble, and being patient, He never answers such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we pray to love others, the more we find that we hate others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we pray to be humble, the more we find that we are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord never answers this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Real prayer is to say, "Lord, I feel that I have not contacted You much this day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I did not go along with You moment by moment."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The real experience of life is the experience of Christ Himself, that is, Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, and Christ formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ Being Magnified in Us</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fourth stage of the experience of Christ is that Christ is magnified in us Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For Christ to be formed within us is something inward, while for Christ to magnified in us is something expressed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, and Christ to be formed within us, and we also need Christ magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For Christ to be magnified in us means that there is always something of, or something as, Christ Himself expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People can always sense something of Christ expressed and magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the real experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not simply to be humble, to be patient, and to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be humble, patient, and loving is common among humans.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the history of China there were certain men who succeeded in their practice to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were so good that compared to them, many Christians may be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians put together could not compare with them in their good character.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, that is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Good character is not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ Himself is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not try to teach Christians simply to have a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the teaching of fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, do your best to experience Christ as everything in the spirit, and try your best to help others to experience Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can we realize what the real experience of Christ is and what the experience of something other than Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we experience something other than Christ, we are always aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we love others merely by ourselves, we know that we are loving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are patient and humble merely by ourselves, we know that we are the most patient and humble person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be aware that we are humble and patient with the brothers simply proves that we are not experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we experience Christ, we simply sense Christ Himself, and we are not aware of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Other people realize that in us there is something strange, heavenly, and divine, but we ourselves do not sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we know we are loving the brothers, that means we are not loving by Christ; we are not experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Try to test this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we can say, "O brothers, do you realize how humble and patient I have been with you?", this simply proves we are now out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we can feel how good we are, this shows how much we are out of Christ.</S>
