   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the beginning of the Old Testament, the Triune God had not yet been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But at the beginning of the New Testament we have the first step of God's process incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Triune God, who created everything, entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This certainly was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God here is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Triune God, as the Word, became flesh v. 14 . Christians often say that the Son of God became flesh, but they rarely say that the Triune God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Bible does not say that the Son of God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, the Bible says that God was manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The God who became flesh, who was manifested in the flesh, was not a partial God but the whole God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This very God was begotten of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a human virgin and came forth from the womb with the human essence, the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in this wonderful One we can see both the divine essence and the human essence, both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our Jesus is both the complete God and a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, after spending some time in Egypt, the Lord Jesus was brought to Galilee and grew up in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, He became a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a Nazarene, He lived in the home of a poor carpenter for thirty years, doing the work of carpentry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the Triune God to remain in the womb of a human virgin for nine months was amazing, but for the God-man, as a Nazarene, to live in a poor carpenter's home for thirty years and do the work of carpentry was even more amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the age of thirty, the Lord Jesus came forth to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He was baptized by John, "the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him" Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, as the One who was begotten of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a virgin to be the God-man, He, with the Spirit upon Him, began to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His ministry He called certain ones to follow Him, attracting them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day, the Lord Jesus brought three of His disciples to the top of a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There on the mountaintop "He was transfigured before them, and His face shown as the sun, and His garments became white as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And behold, Moses and Elijah were seen by them, conversing with Him" Matt 17:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While Peter was making the foolish suggestion that they build "three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah" v. 4 , "a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him!" v. 5 . God was telling the disciples not to hear Moses and Elijah but to hear His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the Lord was transfigured, He spoke to His disciples about His death and resurrection Matt 17:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, He went to Jerusalem, where He was judged by the Jewish religion and the Roman government, and then He was crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The disciples, of course, were deeply disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the third day, the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, He appeared to the disciples in a very mysterious way, in a way that we cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult to say whether He appeared physically or spiritually, because He had a physical body that could be touched, yet He suddenly appeared in the room without coming through the door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The wonderful One, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, had become, through death and resurrection, a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He became the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As such a One, He breathed Himself into His disciples.</S>
