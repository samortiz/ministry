   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Receiving but Not Committing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Responsibilities in the Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>with Different Views</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we receive brothers and sisters with different views, we cannot commit any responsibility in the service to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This prevents problems in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Receiving is one thing, but bearing responsibility in the service is another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We feel that in raising us up the Lord has commissioned us, and we should be faithful and responsible to His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, although the Lord s table is open to all God s children and every believer can partake of it, we cannot be so open related to responsibility in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only brothers and sisters with the same view should join in and bear the burden together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If those who do not have the same view bear responsibilities, neither they nor we will profit from it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be able to make this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being unable to bear responsibility in the service should not prevent one from being received, nor does being received mean that he can bear responsibility in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This matter is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, we should not refuse a brother who emphasizes sprinkling and wants to break bread with us, even though we practice immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should still receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, after receiving him, there will be problems if we ask him to immediately take up responsibility in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will bring in his ideas and opinions and contend and argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, neither he nor others will benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we need to exercise wisdom in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no problem with breaking bread and fellowshipping with this brother, but giving him responsibility in the service should not be done quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that we will never give him responsibility but that this needs to be done slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to find opportunities to have thorough fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps our views are wrong, and we should be adjusted; or his views are wrong, and he can be gradually subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In any case, we must have the same view in order to bear the same responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some who are still not clear concerning this may think that we are being too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would simply ask, Can every believer be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though every saved person is a brother and can come to break bread, not everyone can come here and be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because breaking bread is a matter of salvation, but the eldership involves a commission of responsibility that can be assumed only when a person arrives at a certain level in spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here is another illustration: While we all have equal opportunity to serve, not everyone can give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone can break bread, but not everyone can stand up to minister the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because ministering the Word is a matter of commission, a matter of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is impossible for an eighty-year-old grandfather, a fifty-year-old father, and an eight-year-old child to bear the same responsibility in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At mealtime there is no distinction between the three at the dinner table.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, in relation to bearing responsibility for the family, no responsibility would be given to an eight-year-old or even to someone who is eighteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because they are not matured.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Giving them responsibility for the family can only cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is all right to let the children do some daily, trivial tasks, but when weighty matters arise in the family, only the father, the mother, and the older brothers and sisters can participate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must see that although the Lord s table is open, responsibility in service is restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not wrong for brothers with different views to invite people and accompany them to gospel meetings, but the responsibilities of the church cannot be committed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Responsibility can be given only to those who are more experienced and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that all the leading ones in the churches can understand this and will not give responsibility to someone simply because he has been received or not receive a person because he is unable to bear any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be able to discern between receiving someone and committing responsibilities to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Encouraging the Brothers and Sisters,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever They Arrive in a Locality, to First Look for a Meeting That Is on the Ground of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>in Order to Meet and Serve Together</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>with Such Saints; If No Meeting Is Found, Endeavoring to Preach the Gospel,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lead People to Salvation, and</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lead the Believers to Know the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and Establishing a Meeting on the Ground</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>of the Church with Them</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we go to a place, we should first find out if there is a meeting that is on the ground of the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If there is a meeting on the ground of the church that is proper in nature, not belonging to a sect or denomination, we must meet and serve with them, regardless of whether we knew of or fellowshipped with them previously.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not set up another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we set up another meeting that is apart from them in that locality, we are creating a sect; we are dividing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If such a meeting cannot be found, we need to be faithful and not fear the hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On one hand, we should not take part in a denomination that may be there, and on the other hand, we should endeavor to preach the gospel to lead people to be saved, to know the church, and to have a clear understanding of the ground and the way of the church so that a proper meeting on the ground of the church can be established with them.</S>
