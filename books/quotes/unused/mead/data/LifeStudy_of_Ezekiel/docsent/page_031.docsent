   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE EIGHT THE COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES 2 Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:11-14; Rom 12:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the vision in chapter one of Ezekiel, we have paid close attention to the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, to the four faces of the living creatures the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle and to the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous message we began to consider the coordination of the four living creatures, and in this message we will consider this matter further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD S EXPRESSION, MOVE, AND ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is crucial for us to realize that Ezekiel 1 shows us the desire of God s heart and unveils to us the purpose that God wants to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we read this chapter, we may think that it speaks merely about four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if we read this chapter carefully, we will see that it speaks of God s desire to be expressed in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The four faces of the living creatures signify the complete and adequate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, the four living creatures with their four faces signify a coordinated, corporate entity, the corporate Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This corporate Christ is the corporate expression of God among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The four living creatures exist for at least three reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, these living creatures are for God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God in the Son wants to express Himself among men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, the living creatures are for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As they coordinate together, they are full of burning, shining, and enlightening, and the great and high wheel, which is for God s move, follows them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This one entity composed of four living creatures is both for God s expression and His move.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their expression of God is for the move of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, the living creatures are for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Over their heads was the likeness of an expanse, or a firmament Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1:22 , and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne v. 26 . The throne is for God s ruling, God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God has His expression, move, and administration, He can manifest Himself in His glory and complete His eternal purpose and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today many Christians think that the reason for believing in the Lord Jesus is that they may have peace and well being in the present and that in the future they may go to heaven to enjoy eternal bliss.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This thought falls far short of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Ezekiel 1 God reveals that He needs a group of living creatures who can coordinate together as one entity for His expression, move, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God gains such a corporate expression, His purpose will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church life God s plan is fulfilled on a small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We who have received grace and have experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum are a group of living creatures with four faces to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have God s grace and power as the wings for both moving and covering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also have the calf s hoofs and thereby have a walk that is full of discernment, enlightening, and freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we can be coordinated together for God s expression, move, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this is our situation in the church life, then when others contact us, they will say, God is among you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There needs to be such an expression of Christ in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regarding the coordination of the living creatures, there are five points that we need to consider: the basis of coordination, the need of coordination, the prerequisites of coordination, the practical condition of coordination, and the result of coordination.</S>
