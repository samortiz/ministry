   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUTURE OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is" 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oh how great is this revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the future has not yet been manifested, nevertheless, do not the two words "like Him" include everything?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Should this not cause our hearts to rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there is a great deal of opposition in the world today, yet all will be well when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we were very lowly and mean, the Lord wants us to be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a glory!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the original intention of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He came down to the world to die so that He could lead "many sons into glory" Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God....into the freedom of the glory of the children of God" Rom 8:19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the creation was subjected to vanity and put under the bondage of corruption, it now groans and travails in pain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But once the children of God receive the glory and the millennium appears, the time of "the restoration of all things" Acts 3:21 will be here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This glory, however, is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the present time, the children of God, along with God's only begotten Son, still suffer the rejection of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross is our portion for today; the crown is for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the present way is narrow, when the millennium begins, "then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father" Matt 13:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reigning with the Lord in the millennium depends on suffering with Him today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, when we think of the future of those who are not the children of God, we have to take warning from them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ours is the glory; theirs is eternal perdition in the lake of fire, the everlasting fire of hell, which is "prepared for the devil and his angels" 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eternal punishment is what the "children of wrath" deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, we have been saved fully.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have seen the Bible's opinion regarding the concept that all in the world are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible altogether denies this untrue concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dear reader, do not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that because all men are the sons of God, there is no need for regeneration, that it is enough just to improve oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need to know: if God demands man to improve, what will happen to those who have so deeply fallen into sin that they are beyond any hope of improvement?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To those people, this kind of "gospel" is indeed not much of a gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the present time, God's door of grace is open wide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whosoever is willing to enter will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God will accept all sinners because of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whosoever believes and trusts in the Lord Jesus can become a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take heed!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Which side are you actually on on God's side or on the devil's side?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are you God's children or the devil's children?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it salvation or perdition, eternal life or eternal death for you?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no neutral ground between them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Which side are you on?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have not yet accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior and have not become a child of God through Him, you are still of Adam and of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam sinned, begetting children in his own sinful image Gen 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are the direct descendant of Adam; apart from regeneration, there is no other way for you to become a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that because you are better than others that you are not a child of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must know that God has only one kind of children: those who have been redeemed by the Lord Jesus through believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only they are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not care for anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please do not wait until it is too late to believe in Him.</S>
