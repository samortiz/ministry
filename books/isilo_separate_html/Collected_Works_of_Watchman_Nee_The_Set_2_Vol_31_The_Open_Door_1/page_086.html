Forgive me for waiting to greet you until now. I heard my father tell his company in Hankow to send X dollars to you in January. Did you receive the wire? Are you safe in Chungking? Are Sisters Wang and Chang well? If you have time, please send me a note. The business in Hong Kong has received God's protection and blessing. It has doubled since last year. My father went to Singapore on January 2. He hopes to buy a store there. Please pray for him. If God is pleased, we will open a branch store. Although I am so busy, my health is still holding up. It is all the Lord's grace. My brother has returned to Shanghai. He will not open a store for the time being. Sister Liu Ching-dong is now helping me in the store. I will tell you the rest later.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Huang Shiu-bao<br />February 12<br />[Addresss omitted]</p><p>(This letter was sent by Brother Huang Tsao-ling's daughter Shiu-bao&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><p>Dear brother in the Lord:</p><p>I think you will want to know about the condition of the church in Singapore and Brother Luk's work. I will report some of it to you. We are now temporarily meeting at...Singapore. This is Brother Wang Kai-sen's home. (Brother Wang is one of the responsible brothers in this locality.) The number of people has increased, and the place is too small. We are looking for a meeting hall. There are more than fifty brothers and sisters, with more brothers than sisters. This is different from other places. There is a gospel meeting now at 10:00 a.m. on the Lord's Day and an edification meeting at 2:30 p.m. The table meeting is at 7:30 p.m. There are meetings every day from Monday through Saturday, such as the prayer meeting, the sisters' meeting, the brothers' meeting, the Bible study, etc. The Lord has raised up the work among us. The brothers sent a letter inviting Brother Ke-san, Brother Lien-jun, and Brother Stephen Kaung to come. We do not know what the Lord will do yet. Brother Luk will be leaving tonight (January 10) for Penang. He will return to Singapore in about ten days. We hope you will pray for all matters concerning us. May the Lord be with you until that day. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Ren-shan<br />January 10</p><p>(This letter was sent from Singapore to K'un-ming&mdash; Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise our Lord for His faithfulness. His promise to me on January 1, 1937 was true. The eternal God is really our hiding place and shield. Praise His name! When I felt that I should travel south, I placed the matter before God. Thank the Lord for leading me step by step. I told the Lord that if it was His will for me to leave Shanghai, He should prepare someone to rent my house and furniture for a certain price. I went through several months of testing. It seemed that my house was not going to be rented, but I kept saying that what was difficult for man was not difficult for God; I was peaceful in my heart. Indeed, the Father had already made arrangements for me secretly! I not only rented my house for the price asked, but the timing was perfect. The lease on the tenant's old house was not up until December 20, and we could stay until that day. On the twenty-third, there was a boat to Manila and our passports were ready about the same time. I really saw the Lord's love. He is not a respecter of persons. He really remembers the orphans and the widows. The Lord prepared a job for Mrs. Chien and a home for Yi-tseng (Mrs. Chien's son). Thank the Lord, He really is the Lord who does beyond what we ask or think! Praise His name! We left Shanghai on December 23 and passed though Hong Kong on the twenty-fifth. We met with many brothers and sisters there. We really saw the Lord's love everywhere! We felt both thankful and ashamed in our hearts! We arrived safely in Manila on the twenty-seventh and are now living in my elder brother's house. May the Lord accomplish what He wants to do in His children. Please pray for me. Please greet Sister Chang and Sister Wang for me. Peace in the Lord. En-hung and my daughters all ask me to greet you.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yun-chang<br />January 18</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> </body></html>
