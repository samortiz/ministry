   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IS IT OCCUPIED?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once I was preaching the gospel with a co-worker of mine in a village.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the way back we were extremely thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was neither a teahouse nor stream for us to get water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact the whole area was uninhabited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After walking for a while we came across a thatched hut.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We went to the door quickly and knocked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For a long time there was no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We thought that no one lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we opened the door and went in, we found that the floor was swept clean.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In one of the rooms was a bed with nicely folded sheets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a teapot on the table, and the tea in it was still warm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I said, "Surely someone must be living here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the arrangements indicate beyond doubt that this place is occupied by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not drink this tea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must get out quickly or else people will think we are thieves."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We walked out and waited for the owner to return.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By observing the arrangements of the house, we concluded that someone was living there, without having seen the occupant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way, we know that God is there by the arrangement of everything in the universe, although we cannot see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every single phenomenon of nature is so balanced, organized, meaningful, and functional.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say that they come by chance, but it is impossible for me to believe that chance is its sole originator.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only foolish people can say in their hearts that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHANCE OR DESIGN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The universe has to be created by Someone with profound wisdom, vast knowledge, and intricate design.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you cannot accept the concept of random formation of the universe, you have to admit that it was created by such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There cannot be a third explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The choice is left to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to decide if the universe came by chance or whether it was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A DEMAND AND ITS OBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One witness may not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will call in another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This time we will consider man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before doing so, we should also observe one fact: wherever there is a desire, there must first be an object for that desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, an orphan who has never seen his father naturally has a desire for a kind of paternal love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have asked many people who were orphans, and they all have felt this irrepressible yearning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this we can see that every desire of the heart arises out of an object in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As human beings we have a need for social belonging.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need companionship and mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you put a boy on a deserted island and he grows up alone, he still has the yearning for companions, for beings like himself, even though he has never seen a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This yearning or desire is the very proof that somewhere in the world there is something known as "man."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At a certain age, man begins to think about posterity; he starts desiring children and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not a mere fantasy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This desire stems out of the existence and possibility of offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, where there is desire, there is an object for that desire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THERE IS GOD IN THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do we have any desires other than social identity and self-propagation?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What other cravings do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Deep in everyone there is a craving for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether they are highly civilized races, such as those among the Caucasians, or the ancient civilizations, such as the Chinese civilizations, or the African natives and uncultured aborigines, they all have a common craving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as they are men, they have a yearning for God, no matter what race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You cannot argue against it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone is seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everywhere man is craving for God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By applying the principle that we just mentioned, we can see that since our heart feels the need for a God, there must necessarily be a God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since there is a need for God in the heart, there must be the existence of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If no God exists, we would never have such a craving in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all have an appetite for food.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same way, we all have an appetite for God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It would be impossible to live if there was only an appetite for food but no food.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, it would be impossible to live if there was a capacity for God but no God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT GOD?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once an atheist rudely rebuked me in a loud voice: "You said that a man has the psychological need for a God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But there is no such thing, and I do not believe in it."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said, "Well, do you mean to say that you never think about God?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In fact, even while you were talking, you were thinking about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This indicates that you do have a capacity for God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no one who has never thought about God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He may try not to think much about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since this thought is in you, there must be such an object outside of you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>THE WORDS AND THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A young man once came to me to argue about God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was vehemently against the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He gave me one reason after another for saying that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As he was enumerating the various reasons why God should not exist, I listened to him quietly without saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then I said, "Although you insist that there is no God and support yourself with so many arguments, you have lost your case already."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He said, "What do you mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I went on to explain: "Your mouth can say as much as you want about there not being a God, but your heart is on my side."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He had to agree with me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although one can give all sorts of reasons in the head, there is a belief in the heart that no argument can defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A stubborn person may give a thousand and one reasons, but you can have the boldness to tell him, "You know better in your heart that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why bother to look for evidence outside?"</S>
