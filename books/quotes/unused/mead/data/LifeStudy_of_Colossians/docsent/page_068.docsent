   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WAR AT THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 2:15 portrays the fighting that took place at the time of Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Evil men had put Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By His crucifixion Christ labored to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God the Father was also working to judge sin and to nail the law to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time, the rulers and authorities were busy in the attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reference to triumph in verse 15 implies fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It indicates that a war was raging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While Christ was accomplishing redemption and God was dealing with the law and with the negative things, the rulers and authorities came to interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They pressed in close to God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But at that very juncture, God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to an open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 2:15 is a small window through which we behold a marvelous sight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time of Christ s crucifixion, a battle was raging between God and the rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God stripped them off and triumphed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>PAUL S CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul s concept in these verses is that the law and the angels have been set aside through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law was nailed to the cross, and the evil angels have been stripped off by means of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in God s economy in His salvation there is room neither for the law nor for the angelic rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How wrong the Colossians were in following ordinances and in worshipping angels!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law with its ordinances, including the keeping of the Sabbath, had been nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Colossians were altogether wrong in allowing these things to pervade the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, in the cross God overcame the angelic rulers and put them to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a blunder to be led astray to worship angels!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR THE ENLIVENING OF HIS CHOSEN ONES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we see the vision conveyed in these verses, many problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, no one will be able to convince us to go back to the observance of the seventh day Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one will be able to persuade us to be subject to the ordinances God has nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To follow such ordinances is to be blind and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is to be ignorant of the Bible or to know it only superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who advocate Sabbath keeping may appeal to certain verses in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may try to argue that both the Lord Jesus and Paul went to the synagogue on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, 2:14 and 16 make it clear that the ordinances, including the observance of the Sabbath, have been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who advocate the observance of the Sabbath have never touched the depths of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not realize that through the cross the ordinances have been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the rulers and authorities who gathered around God and Christ in displeasure at what was taking place on the cross have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When these evil angels surrounded God and Christ, God overcame them and stripped them off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the law has been nailed to the cross, and the rulers and the authorities have been stripped off from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What remains now is God s redeemed people who are in a position to be enlivened by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now that the law and the angels have been set aside, God has a clear ground and a peaceful environment for the enlivening of His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He now has a proper atmosphere to carry out the pleasant task of enlivening the very ones He chose in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He delights to put His life into them and to make them alive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Colossians needed to see such a vision, and we also need to see it today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because they lacked this vision, the Colossians were trying to keep the law and were worshipping angels.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How foolish!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The aspects of the economy of God s salvation in 2:13-15 are presented in a good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the economy of His salvation God enlivens us, nails the law to the cross, and strips off the evil rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The law is a frustration, and the rulers and authorities are troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because God has removed the law and the angels, we, His chosen people, are alone with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are no longer bothered by terms, conditions, or requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is here to enliven us, and we are here to be enlivened by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should forget the law and the angels and allow God to put Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The law that was used to expose our sinfulness has been nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, the angels have been stripped off from God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have you ever realized that at the time of the crucifixion God and Christ were so busy?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Have you ever seen that the evil rulers and authorities were swarming around God and Christ and that a warfare was raging at the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe that few Christians have seen these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise the Lord that by triumphing over the angelic powers and stripping them off, God has cleared the ground to enliven His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of the subtlety of the enemy, the believers at Colosse were returning to the ordinances of the law and even were worshipping angels.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a great heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The principle is the same among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christians may follow various ordinances, and those in Catholicism may even worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who do not worship angels may still greatly admire them and unconsciously aspire to be like angels.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many sisters especially desire a type of angelic spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But in principle to admire angels is to adore them, to worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I can testify that in me there is no place for angels.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has the ground to contact me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The law and the angels are not between me and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The environment and the atmosphere are very suitable for God to contact us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, God is not here to judge us, for He has already judged us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is not even here to deal with us, because He has dealt with us already.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God is here to accomplish one thing to enliven us by imparting life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God is giving life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the meetings of the church life, we are being enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Concerning this, the law and the angels have no place.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should remind the rulers and authorities that at Calvary God stripped them off and triumphed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Based upon God s victory, we can order them to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we need today is not the law or the angels, but the enlivening One, the life-giving One.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the economy of God s salvation.</S>
