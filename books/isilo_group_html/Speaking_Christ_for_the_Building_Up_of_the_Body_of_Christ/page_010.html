<h1 class="title">THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 8:4; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52; Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:31, 8; 13:9; Phil. 3:8-10, 12-14; Col. 3:16; John 15:7; 1 John 2:14; Eph. 5:19; 1 Cor. 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31</h1>
<p>In order to enrich and enliven our meeting, we must learn how to speak the word of the Lord in the Scriptures. We must learn to speak and not just read the word. We must also learn to have a corporate speaking of the word in our meetings. This practice is new among the Lord&rsquo;s children. Everyone in the meeting should exercise his spirit and pay much attention to speaking and listening. When one speaks, the others should listen. When we have the speaking that utters and releases the holy word, the riches of God&rsquo;s word will be prevailing to touch all the attendants. We must practice this.</p>
<p>In order to be a speaking one in our meetings, we should be people with a proper character. Without a proper living, our speaking will have no backing. Our daily living, our character, or what we are, is the real backing of our speaking. In the previous chapter we saw eight points concerning the kind of persons we need to be so that we can be the proper speaking ones. In this chapter we want to see nine more aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING CHRIST TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE<br />
DAILY IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON</h2>
<p>We need to be those who speak Christ to all kinds of people daily in season and out of season (Acts 5:42; 8:4; 2 Tim. 4:2). We should speak Christ to people from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation (Rev. 5:9). In Mark 16:15 the Lord Jesus charged us to preach the gospel to all the creation. This indicates that we should pick up the burden for the preaching of the gospel to such an extent that we would speak to whatever is around us. We should speak to the mountains, the trees, the rivers, the animals, and the entire creation. If we practice this, we will become exercised in speaking. This will strengthen us to speak with power. If we speak awkwardly, that will weaken our speaking and even weaken the contents of our speaking. This is why we should practice speaking Christ all the time even though no person may be present. We always have the entire creation to speak to. I am grateful to the Lord that I practiced this when I was a young man.</p>
<p>When I talk to the saints about the matter of speaking, some tell me that it is not the right time for them to speak. According to their realization, no time is the right time for us to speak. But we have much time to talk on the telephone. It seems that every hour is available for gossip, but no time is available for speaking Christ. This is why Paul charged Timothy to speak the word of God in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2). Whether the time is the right time or the &ldquo;wrong time&rdquo; for us to speak, we still have to speak. In season or out of season, we have to speak. Our obligation is to speak forth Christ. To speak Christ is never wrong.</p>
<p>When we gossip or speak foolishly, we make ourselves useless. Nothing can destroy our speaking of Christ like a telephone call. To gossip on the telephone is a real temptation. The telephone is a part of American life, but we should not be addicted to talking on it. Sometimes the telephone can be like fly paper. Once we get stuck to it, we cannot get away. The more we indulge in vain talk on the telephone, the more we kill our spirit. Sometimes after talking on the telephone, we are unable to pray because our loose talk has deadened us. Why would we not talk to people about the Lord and about the holy Word? We should learn to save our time and even our spirit by escaping from unnecessary talk on the telephone.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
