   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 72 CHRIST GAINS THE EARTH BY WATERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the last Psalm of Book II, Psalm 72.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Psalms are like a great mountain with many peaks, and here we have another peak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 72 tells us how Christ shall reign over the whole earth and how the saints shall be glorified and blessed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly we see that He will reign with righteousness and justice, by which peace will be ushered in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Christ returns, He will be the King, ruling over the entire earth with righteousness and justice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the earth will be full of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>People today speak much about peace, but there will be no peace until Christ returns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under His rule, real peace will begin its reign.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mountains shall bring peace to the people" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Secondly, this Psalm presents Christ in His rule like rain watering the earth; so the saints shall flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even at the time when Christ returns for judgment, He will be like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the way Christ gains the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He gains it by His watering, not by fighting, not by condemning, not by judging.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This river is the same as the one mentioned in Psalm 46: "There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is really meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That river signifies the flowing out of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the Lord's kingdom and reign is spread to the ends of the earth by the flowing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His dominion is by Himself as the watering river, and He gains the dominion by watering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether you say watering or flowing, rain or the river, they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rain is the river, and the watering is the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord will recover the entire earth, not by examining, not by judging, not by smiting, but by watering!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Undoubtedly the Lord Jesus will return to exercise His righteous judgment upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But that is only one aspect of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The other is that He will come back as the rain to water the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the entire earth is as a dry and barren wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many evil and sinful things spring forth from this drought and dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Men are sinful because they are disappointed and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you merely judge them, smite them, and condemn them, the problem will not be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, the Lord Jesus in His righteousness must exercise His judgment upon all sinful things; but this is not the main aspect of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The primary feature is that He will come down as showers to water the dry and thirsty land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will have pity on this earth, and thus His dominion will not be by judging and smiting, but by watering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a Christ will have dominion from sea to sea and will flow as a river to the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where the flow is, there also is the dominion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In that day all people black and white, yellow and red will be rained upon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will be so happy under Christ's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>O the watering, O the satisfaction, O the peace, O the security when Christ returns!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus will return to satisfy people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will be the King, not by exercising power to subdue others, but by supplying living water to satisfy the thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All will be satisfied by His living water.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will reign from the river to the ends of the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He shall have dominion over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I was a young Christian, I was given much teaching concerning the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these teachings set forth Christ as a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was taught that He would blast and smite the people in His anger.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Never did I hear a message saying that the Lord Jesus would come back so graciously as showers of rain to water the barren land and satisfy the depressed and empty people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But from the Psalms I have assurance to say that, while in one sense He will come back to judge, yet even in His judging the earth will be watered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The river will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will come to possess the earth not only by exercising power, but by the flowing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will take the earth by means of that river, the river which flows from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jerusalem in that day will be the center of the earth, and in the center of Jerusalem will be the house, from which the river flows.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I believe that this river will reach all the earth in four directions, as in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His dominion will be from the river unto the ends of the earth not just by power, but by watering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In that day all the nations shall worship and serve Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He shall deliver the needy and have compassion on the poor, and deceit and violence shall vanish away vv.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These evil things will disappear, not by being judged, but by being watered, by being satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>People steal because they are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But when the Lord Jesus returns, all will be satisfied; so there will be no more deceit and violence.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They will vanish by the Lord's satisfying riches.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He shall live forever, the earth shall be restored because of Him, and men shall be blessed in Him and bless Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do you still remember how Psalm 1 begins?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It says, "Blessed is the man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>" But here it says, "Blessed be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>" This is a real improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God's name is blessed forever, and His glory is manifested in the whole earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Psalm 72 gives a glorious picture of what it will be like for the Lord to recover, possess, and reign over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no "Amen" in Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But here we have "Amen, and Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Praise the Lord for such an improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Praise Him that we may now be in the house within the city in anticipation of that soon coming day when the Lord will take the earth in such a way.</S>
