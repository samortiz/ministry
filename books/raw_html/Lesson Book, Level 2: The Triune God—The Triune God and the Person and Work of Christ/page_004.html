ALL THREE&#151;FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT&#151;BEING GOD</H2><P>In Lesson One we saw that there is only one God, yet mysteriously this God is Triune (three-one)&#151;the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. But the Father is not one-third of God, the Son another third and the Spirit the last third. No! The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Spirit is God. First Peter 1:2 says, "God the Father." Ephesians 1:17 says, "God...the Father of glory." These verses tell us that the Father is God. Hebrews 1:8 says, "As to the Son...O God." John 1:1 says, "The Word was God." These verses tell us clearly that the Son is God. Acts 5:3-4 says, "Why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to the Holy Spirit...? You did not lie to men, but to God." This verse definitely tells us that the Spirit is also God.</P><P>Therefore, the Scriptures clearly reveal to us that all three&#151;the Father, Son, and Spirit&#151;are God. This does not mean, however, that They are three Gods. We have already seen that the Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one. Although there are three&#151;the Father, Son, and Spirit&#151;the three are not three Gods, but one God. This is really a mystery! It is unsearchable! But praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ALL THREE BEING ETERNAL</H2><P>All three&#151;the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&#151;are eternal. Isaiah 9:6 uses the term the "everlasting Father." The literal translation of this Hebrew phrase is "Father of eternity" or "eternal Father." Hence, the Father is eternal.</P><P>The Son is also eternal. Hebrews 1:12 says of the Son, "You are the same, and Your years shall not fail." Hebrews 7:3 says that He has neither beginning of days nor end of life, meaning that He is eternal. "Eternal" is something that has no beginning or ending. This is why a circle rather than a straight line is a sign of the eternal God. It has no beginning and no ending.</P><P>The Spirit also is eternal, for Hebrews 9:14 speaks of "the eternal Spirit." Therefore, in accordance with the Bible, we declare that all Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are eternal.</P>
