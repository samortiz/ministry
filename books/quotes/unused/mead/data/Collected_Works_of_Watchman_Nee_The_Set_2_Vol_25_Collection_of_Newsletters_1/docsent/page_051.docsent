   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On Saturday evening, there is a brothers' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Any question can be asked What is following the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is walking in the way?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do I know the voice of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are questions our brothers have asked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the Lord's Day morning, Brother Chang Kuang Jung is responsible for a building up meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are also many people who come from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although there are those who come from the denominations and they sometimes debate in the meeting, we maintain a humble attitude, and they cannot find anything against us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the afternoon, there is the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On this day we also go out in the streets to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers are zealous in passing out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are also bold in testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we still do not see the results of this type of work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It really needs prayer behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also ask the brothers and sisters to pray.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sisters have also clearly seen the center of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We really hoped that Miss Lee could stay here for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unfortunately, she could not do as we had hoped.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is now a brother in Tsinan, Mr. Ch'ao Miss Lee also knows him who desires and pursues spiritual matters very much with his wife.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I sometimes go with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is difficult for them to understand much all at once because they have not been saved for very long.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We hope that God will gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Nee!</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I continue in that position, I do not know whether I will get a raise or a pay cut!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Maybe I will get a five percent cut in pay.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not know when the provincial hospital will be able to establish a lab.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I also hope to be able to go work in the South, but I do not want to go against the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, I can only wait in this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I also ask you to pray for me and keep a look out for a position for me there are still eight or nine weeks left.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know this is a trouble to you.</S>
