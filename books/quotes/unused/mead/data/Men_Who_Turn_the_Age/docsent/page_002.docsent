   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE NEED FOR MEN WHO TURN THE AGE Scripture Reading: Dan 1:1-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we would like to consider how young people who are under God's hand can be used by Him to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD PURPOSELY USES YOUNG PEOPLE TO TURN THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to realize that many times God does things on earth to turn an age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God works on earth, He does so age by age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason that God has many age-turning moves is that men used by Him in one age often become fallen and fail to reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This forces God to turn the age, that is, to have a new start so that He can do what He wants to do in a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can see many cases like this in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God would bring in a new age by doing something through some people during a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, due to man's degradation, that age would soon become fallen and degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would become so degraded that God could not have a way with men on earth and could not do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, God would have to bring in a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only by bringing in a new age could God do any work again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unfortunately, the next age did not continue for long before it fell again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God once more could not do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consequently, He had to bring in another age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When one reads the Old Testament, he can see that one age came after another had degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One age rose only to see it wane again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another age rose and then also failed again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would like you to realize that God's work in turning the age is always done through men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before a new age is ushered in, there are always men in the previous age who are used by God particularly to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And in every age-turning work, God purposely uses young people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two most obvious examples are Samuel and Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE TURNING OF THE AGE BEING FOR THE BRINGING IN OF GOD'S AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Samuel turned the age of the priesthood to the age of the kingship, whereas Daniel turned the age of captivity to the age of return.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The age of the kingship brought in by Samuel, properly speaking, began with David.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It came to its golden peak when King Solomon built the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time God's authority was manifested through men; God was able to rule through men under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, God's glory was also expressed among men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In those days in Israel, on the one hand, there was the throne of the house of David and, on the other hand, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The throne speaks of God's authority, and the temple, of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One should remember that the glory of God filled the temple when Solomon consecrated it to God immediately after its completion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know that there is symbolic significance in this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The throne and the temple among the Israelites show us that God desires to rule and to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that the young brothers and sisters will see these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants to have a throne on earth and a habitation on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The throne speaks of His ruling, and the habitation speaks of the expression of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such an age was brought in by Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, he brought in a throne and, on the other hand, he brought in a habitation through this throne.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This situation was quite apparent among the Israelites after King Solomon succeeded in building the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God established a throne and ruled through it and obtained a dwelling place, a place for His expression through which He manifested His glory among men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This period can be considered a very normal age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, this condition did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Due to man's corruption and Satan's attacks, this testimony was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Solomon was old, the age had become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time it seemed that God's throne was laid aside and His glory was neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From King Solomon on, his descendants began step by step to fall further.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of King Ahab, their condition could not have become more fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the end of the books of Kings, which was the very end of the age of kingship, everything had become degraded and desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no more of God's throne or God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both of these had disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What could God do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God could only give them up and let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, the enemies came in, and Jerusalem was destroyed; the temple was burned down, and all the utensils for serving God in the temple, together with the Israelites, were carried away to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It totally became the age of captivity because everything was carried away.</S>
