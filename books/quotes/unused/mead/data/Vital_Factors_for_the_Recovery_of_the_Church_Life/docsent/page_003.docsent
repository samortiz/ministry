   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING INCARNATED IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This very God became incarnated in the flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day He entered into the womb of a virgin named Mary, and He accomplished a wonderful conception in that human womb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This happened nearly two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the record of the Bible, God created Adam approximately six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, after two thousand years God came in to call Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God then waited for another two thousand years, and He came to visit a young virgin by the name of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The very God as the Holy Spirit came upon Mary and entered into her womb to conceive the child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Luke 1:35 and Matthew 1:18 and 20 we are told that a child was conceived in the virgin Mary, not of any man, but of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit, who is the very God reaching man, entered into Mary s womb and accomplished a marvelous conception.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He remained in that womb for nine months and was finally born out of that womb as a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After His birth, that little child was put into a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Isaiah 9:6, that little child born to us is called the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you believe that a child born out of a virgin and put into a manger two thousand years ago was the Mighty God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most of the Jews do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They say that their God, who is the very Creator of heaven and earth, could never become a little child who was born out of a human virgin and put into a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Jews deny that Jesus is their God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even today, after twenty centuries, the Jewish people still reject Christ as God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, a small number of Jews were called by this Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Jesus came out to minister at the age of thirty, He called four disciples, Andrew, Peter, James, and John Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These four disciples were all Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, they believed that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, a strong one among the Jews by the name of Saul was opposing and persecuting the people who declared that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But one day, while Saul was on the way to Damascus to arrest all the people who believed that Jesus was God, all of a sudden a great light shone around him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He fell to the ground and heard a voice from heaven say, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Acts 9:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That was a great surprise to Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After hearing the voice from the heavens, he may have thought, I never persecuted anyone in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I persecuted Stephen and other followers of Jesus, and I am going to Damascus to arrest all those who believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of these people are on the earth, not in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why does someone in the heavens come to me and tell me that I am persecuting him?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his bewilderment, Saul said, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The answer was, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Saul s concept, Jesus was crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could this Jesus now be in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The answer is that Jesus is actually the very God of Saul s forefathers Acts 22:14 , the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through this encounter, Saul was converted; Saul believed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had no choice but to confess that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Jesus were not God, how could it be that after He was crucified and buried, He spoke to Saul from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Saul, who was also Paul Acts 13:9 , became the strongest among the Jews not only to believe that Jesus is God, but also to preach this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wherever he went, he told the Jews that the very Jesus whom they rejected is the very Christ, the Son of God Acts 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Genesis 18, one day Jehovah came to visit Abraham with two angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While Abraham sat in the door of his tent on a hot summer day, all of a sudden three men came to him, and he welcomed them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One of these three was Jehovah in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know that Jehovah had a human body because Abraham prepared water that He might wash His physical feet v. 4 . Furthermore, Abraham asked his wife Sarah to prepare a big meal for them, and Jehovah ate that meal vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, Jehovah talked with Abraham as a man would talk with a friend vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>17-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who was that man who visited Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, He was Jehovah, but He appeared to Abraham in a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Was He merely God, or was He a man?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether you dare to say that He was a man or not, still He was in a man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In John 13 Jesus washed the feet of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do believe that while He was washing the feet of Peter and John, He still remembered how Abraham prepared the water for Him to wash His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may say that this could not be true, because at the time of Genesis 18 Jesus was not yet born.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fact that God appeared to Abraham as a man before the birth of Jesus is indeed a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This mystery points us to the fact that Jesus is Jehovah, the very eternal God.</S>
