   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Also, we must realize that the small phrase "in love" is used six times in the book of Ephesians 1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may pick up the things mentioned in Ephesians, yet neglect this little phrase in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians five Paul charges the wives to submit themselves to their husbands v. 22 . Paul does not say, however, that the wives submit and that the husbands rule.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul says that the wives submit and the husbands love v. 25 . A husband should not rule but love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a husband firstly rules, he will eventually eat the fruit of separation and lastly he will eat the final fruit divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ruling only brings forth separation and then divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The best way for a husband to have the best wife is to love her to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more you love her, the better she becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The worst wife can be the best by the husband's loving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Submission is on the wife's side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the husband's side there should not be ruling but loving.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner, submission is on the believers' side, but on the elders' side there should not be ruling but loving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the elders try to rule, the issue will be "separation and divorce."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the elders are ruling the saints in their locality, they will eat the fruit of this in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders must learn how to love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more they love the better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the family life, in the church life, and in the neighborhood life to love is best.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn this lesson to love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Managing and leading gives the elders some kind of authority to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They must remember, however, not to say or do anything without love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let love protect you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let love balance you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In your leadership, always do something in love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In your management always say and do things in love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will protect the church, this will preserve the saints, and this will preserve you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NO SPECIAL GROUP</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, the elders should not let any kind of special group come into existence in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, as a leading one in the local church, you should not practice to attract a small number of saints to be your people, your group.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once you do this, you will open the door for some other groups to arise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We human beings are very prone and apt to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because I am one of the leaders and I need someone to help me, this could become a cloak under which I build up a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, that small group becomes not only your helper, but also your "spies" to collect information for you to protect your interests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many years ago in China, I saw a locality in which five elders had formed two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This happens in any kind of society or in any kind of human organization, but this should be altogether put aside in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not take any lead to form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will corrupt the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever such a thing is produced in your church, immediately there are spies on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The persons in a certain group are always collecting information.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While they are doing this, others who are not in any group would also collect information.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, in most of the church meetings, the main job might be to collect information.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all love the Lord, we all love the church, and we all love the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we are in the recovery, but we human beings have our weakness in our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We like to know others' things and we like to keep all things secret.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Also, we like to protect our own interests.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, there is a basic element of competition compelling us to get helpers, especially when a brother becomes an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before he became an elder, he was nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then after he became an elder, he considered himself to be somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Spontaneously, then, a group is formed and sometimes this group which was formed was due to a very positive need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may need some helpers in your work, but when you get the help you must try to stay away from forming a close group.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once you do this, you damage yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You get the benefit and the help temporarily, but that help contains many corrupting germs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By the Lord's mercy I have always had very close helpers, but I do not have any close group.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have stayed in the United States, working and living here for over twenty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>None of the brothers, however, can say that they are very close to Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whoever has said this has left the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not have any close ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the brothers are one with me "at a distance."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The only one you should be close to without distance is your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are close to anyone without any distance besides your wife, this is corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has ordained that only a couple, husband and wife, should be absolutely one, even one flesh without any distance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With a man and a wife there is not only no distance but also no separation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A man and wife are one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we should not be one with anyone, other than our wife, without some distance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Keeping a distance in this way preserves you and keeps the Lord's work from being corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This also keeps the church from being ruined and keeps your helpers very healthy in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all have to pray, "Lord, have mercy upon us that in the local church where we are there would not be a spy."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am not referring to opposers, but to so-called parties in the local church as spies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I must regretfully say that in some localities some spying goes on even at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This has to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whenever someone comes to you to talk in this way you should not talk and you should stop his talk.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why gossiping in the church life always brings the death element everywhere and to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must also realize that the sisters, with their female nature, are very subjective and cannot be objective as easily as the brothers can.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must also realize that subjectivity always opens the door for corruption to come in. The brothers do not fall into friendships so easily, but the sisters do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Unintentionally, some of the sisters may spontaneously form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you would tell some of the sisters not to form this kind of group around themselves they would say, "Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I don't have one."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Actually they have one unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Immediately after this kind of speaking, one sister may go to another and tell her, "The brothers indicated that we sisters easily form groups among ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I don't have one, do you?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The sister might respond that they do not have a group.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Actually, however, these two sisters are one group already.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Immediately after the brothers' speaking, this sister would always go to certain other sisters and never to some other ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Eventually, these two sisters and the other ones in their group begin to tell one another how terrible it is that the brothers are always belittling the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They may even have a "telephone conference" which is eventually filled with negative talk and gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is a corruption and a ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>By the Lord's mercy always try to avoid this and to kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This does not mean that you have to "declare war" on the sisters involved in this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As elders who take the lead to shepherd the church, to feed the flock, we should always minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we hold such an attitude of exercising our spirit to minister life to the flock, life itself will kill the germs.</S>
