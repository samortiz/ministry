   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE SIX CALMNESS OF MIND Issue No. 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is very easy for the heart to become cold; it is also extremely difficult for the head to remain calm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not have to plan or endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the twinkling of an eye, when we are just slightly unwatchful, our loving heart toward God and man spontaneously cools down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But it is not so with our head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times, the more we think, the more confused we become, and also the more we think, the hotter we become.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We lose our calmness because we are agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heart should be hot and the head should be cool.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being calm in our head is to keep from being agitated in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Saints who seek for the fullness of life must pay attention to their head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although a man's thoughts cannot control his life, they do affect his life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man is not calm in his head, he will not be calm in his attitude and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once a man's head is hot, he cannot control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Self-control is the ninth item of the wonderful fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Losing self-control is to lose the fragrance of the Holy Spirit which runs through our life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once our head is agitated, we unconsciously change from the way we normally behave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under these circumstances, we are tossed to and fro like waves, floating in the air, and unable to control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our words, deeds, and conduct are subconsciously affected by the mental agitation in our head; so we begin to act abnormally.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notwithstanding, believers who have suffered this do not realize their loss.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are calm, it is easy to discern the agitation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we are agitated, we may not see our own problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we observe the actions, words, and attitude of an agitated person, we may condemn him, saying, "So-and-so is bound by his flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, when we are agitated and behave the same way, we may not see our own problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the difference between being calm and being agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are calm in our mind, we will have a very clear understanding and accurate evaluation concerning everything; otherwise, we will confuse right with wrong and lose all standards of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only can we observe this behavior in others; we can see it in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we are agitated and changed in our behavior, which results in abnormal conduct and abnormal speech, our anger begins to subside and our head begins to calm down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would quietly reflect upon the way we conducted ourselves during our agitation, we would secretly laugh at our previous mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Either we will deeply condemn ourselves or be ashamed of our former conduct and secretly blush.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our head is calm, we will not repeat the same things that we did when our head was hot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we maintain our calmness, we will not approve of agitated conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, we have become agitated many times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are agitated, our conduct becomes either sinful or loose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we consider, the angrier we become.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We burn with fury within and become agitated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, we fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are agitated, we often sneer unnaturally, jest, or speak words which contradict our inward feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tide of our thoughts roars, rising and falling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes we can neither sleep at night nor eat during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we are joyful; sometimes we are sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes we fiercely plod on and labor, or we purposely hold back and drag our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>None of these phenomena portray our true intention.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When everything is over and we sit before the Lord to reflect and examine ourselves under His light, we would often laugh at ourselves and wonder that we have been so soulish!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all know that the way we behave during times of agitation is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, when we are agitated, we have no power to control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since this is the case, we should guard ourselves from agitating things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should maintain a calmness in our head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we know that we have been agitated, we should say to ourselves, "I have been agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I better not do anything now or I will have another failure."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should resist Satan and stop him from taking advantage of these agitating situations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Learn to be a master over yourself at such times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Learn to manage the agitation and subject it to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first victory will increase your capacity to have the second victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not know whether we are agitated, we should ask ourselves, "Am I speaking, thinking, and behaving this way because I am agitated?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If so we should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen us so that we can control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should control the agitation rather than being controlled by the agitation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Agitation is often the instrument that Satan utilizes to cause saints, first, to commit sin especially anger and, second, to stray from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If by any chance we become careless in this matter, we bring shame to the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever your thoughts are shaken and your emotions confused, do not forget this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Calmness of head is the condition for maintaining one's peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The loss of peace occurs mainly because your head becomes agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Agitation usually results in the loss of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, it is possible for one to keep his peace even after he is agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the cross, manifested by God's word, works deeply within us, causing our spirit and soul to be divided in experience, we will have the full power to take charge of the agitation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though the environment and things surrounding the heart may be confused and uncertain, the heart will not be moved, and an inward, calm serenity will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Though things done in agitation may sometimes be good, none of them are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Having a calm head is a necessary condition for the Holy Spirit to lead us to walk according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are agitated, Satan will have the opportunity to manipulate us and will lead us off the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A calm head will give the Holy Spirit an opportunity to lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Holy Spirit cannot utilize our confusion; rather, when we are in a calm spirit, He will shine calm light into our mind so that we may know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even the most spiritual saint cannot completely avoid agitation; unless he is on the alert all the time, he is not free from this danger.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who follow the Lord soberly must pay attention to this matter.</S>
