   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In January 1934 he held his third overcomer conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following excerpt is taken from his announcement of this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The announcement appeared as part of his open letter in the thirty-second issue of The Present Testimony of October December 1933 and tells us the nature of that conference:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The conference held in November of last year was of a different nature, and for that reason we consider the upcoming conference to be the third overcomer conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I want all the brothers to understand the nature of this type of conference; no attention will be paid to the less significant matters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we want to see in the Holy Spirit is Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matters such as prophecy, church organization, Scripture exposition, types, baptism, laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, miracles, and a hundred other questions have their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Christians we should not deny them their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, these are neither the center of the Scriptures nor the center of the life of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has only one center, which is Christ Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our annual conferences of this nature are to bring us back to this center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we are reluctant to mention any minor matters in these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we would emphasize only the central point which God Himself stressed....</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our conference this time, as before, we wish to stress the central message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After much prayer I feel the theme which the Lord has given me for this conference is "God's overcomers."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything in the conference will focus on this center....</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, in this conference, our hope is to meet Christ, to receive light and revelation from heaven, and to be filled with the life that is unknown to ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not intend to pay attention to the many minor, outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"To know Him" Phil 3:10 this is what we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
