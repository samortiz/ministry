   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wilderness is the place for the lost and wandering sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also the place for the hungry ones who cannot find satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wilderness is not related to sin, but is related to desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Describe how the desolation of human living is like the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All things of human living are tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Solomon said, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He also said all things under the sun are like chasing the wind and grasping a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here you need to make all the things of the world sound so desolate, and make home, school and business sound meaningless and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The wandering of human living Point out that in the eyes of God men are His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man did not come into being by himself, but he came from God and belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of man s living comes out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So men are God s flock, and God is a God who created men and who cares for men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When man lost God, he became a sheep without a shepherd just like a sheep who lost its shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because man lost God, man s living became a wandering, without a master.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a saying, Everything has its own master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is your master?</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have no master.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you are sick, there is no one to comfort you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a tragedy overtakes you, there is no one to rescue you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of this is true because you are a sheep without a shepherd and without a master.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This section is to speak about the situation of the wandering of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because you are a person without a master, your living has no purpose, and you are just wandering around in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The vanity of human living Those who were with Jesus in that day were like sheep without a shepherd on one hand, and were hungry on the other hand.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Human living is dissatisfied because of the lack of food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is nothing that can substitute for food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You might have fame, position, etc., but you are still empty and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the wilderness you cannot find food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have no food, and you have nowhere to buy food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You should stress the point that in the wilderness of human living, you have no way to satisfy yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if you paid a great price, you would still be dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People like the monks, nuns, and those who strive to cultivate their morality all end up dissatisfied, empty, and having nothing to fill themselves up with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Jesus came That day the Lord Jesus came to the wilderness, the place of the desolation of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You need to portray how into such a big wilderness there came the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Seeing the multitude of the hungry ones, Jesus was moved and had compassion for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus fed them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This feeding was miraculous, because the bread was not purchased and had not been brought along with them, but it was supplied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This supplying was done through a supernatural power; only Jesus can supply the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the wilderness of human living, there is nothing to satisfy man; only Jesus can supply the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus became the good shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Inasmuch as He had satisfied men and made them His sheep, He is responsible for all their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Formerly you had no one to lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now that you are saved, Jesus will lead you, and He will become the good shepherd of all your life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How to be saved Receive Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To receive is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fact that they received the bread into them means that they received Jesus by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jesus is the bread of life, and needs to be received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus is also the good shepherd, and needs us to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To receive the bread solves the problem of the vanity and emptiness of human living; to follow the shepherd solves the problem of the wandering of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as our vanity, emptiness, and wandering are over, the wilderness is past.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The result of receiving Fed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jesus is the bread of life, causing us to be fed and satisfied.</S>
