   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your divine intention.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You want to make us exactly the same as You are in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, You have added Your divine life to our created, fallen, redeemed, and resurrected humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, You have sanctified our crooked disposition to make us like You are in Your holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, You are still working until we are redeemed in our body to make us like You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, we will be able to say, "Lord, what You are, we are, and what we are, You are."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only difference is that You have the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We thank You and worship You that we don't have the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are the Triune God, processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have humanity plus divinity, and You have divinity plus humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What a wonder that God has humanity!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The processed, consummated Triune God has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, open the heavens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to be in heaven to see all the things as You see them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Give us the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is absolutely a new culture in a mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need Your language; we need Your utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO OPEN THE SEVENTH SECTION OF CONFORMATION A. The Consummation of Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Conformation is the consummation of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Transformation is a gradual work to transform us into the glorious image of Christ 2 Cor 3:18 that needs a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are still in the process of being transformed, but our transformation has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The consummation of our transformation is our conformation to conform the transformed believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God the first God-man Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see the difference between Christ as the only begotten Son and as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ being the Firstborn indicates that many sons are following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ's resurrection three big items were produced: the firstborn Son was produced, the life-giving Spirit who is the transfiguration of the last Adam was produced 1 Cor 15:45b , and all the chosen, predestinated ones were regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What an outcome this was!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. The Full Growth of the Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a conformation is the full growth of the processed Triune God the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit as the divine life in Christ Col 1:28 that grows in the believers unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. The Full-grown Man</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is also the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ 1:23 , which has a stature with a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is all-inclusive and all-extensive, unlimited; He is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a One has a Body, and this Body is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Body has a stature, and the stature has a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who can measure the stature of the Body of Christ, the fullness of the unlimited Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But our conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God will be the full-grown man at the proper measure of the proper stature of the proper expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Body is the aggregate of all the believers who through transformation have been conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although such a measure is immeasurable, we can attain it through our conformation.</S>
