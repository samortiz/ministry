   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PROFIT AND LOSS COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HOME MEETINGS AND BIG MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23b, 26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I originally intended to use only the first two nights to speak about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the more I speak the more burden I have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tonight I will speak more on the comparison of the profit and loss of the home meetings and the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I feel that we should consult the methods of others and also reconsider our experiences in the past thirty-six years here in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that by comparing these two kinds of meetings, we will receive much benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PROPAGATING FROM ONE SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>TO ALL SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must admit that God s wisdom surpasses all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s works are created by Him and accomplished by Him and have no need of any improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result three thousand were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately the church was established and began to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 2:46 says, And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, we see in verse 42 that they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see a clear picture that the church meetings include on the one hand the big meetings and on the other hand the small gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The big meetings were in the temple and the small gatherings were from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the big meetings in the temple surely Peter spoke and others listened to his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When it came to the meetings from house to house, there must have been a good number of people sharing what they had heard in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 42 says, ...continuing steadfastly in the teaching...of the apostles, and verse 46 says, breaking bread from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two verses are two little show windows through which you can see the contents inside.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They met from house to house and everyone spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did not speak of their own things but they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and spoke whatever Peter had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Within one to two days one speaking brother, Peter, was propagated into hundreds of speaking brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SPREADING OUT FOR THE PROPER GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can deny that the home meetings have recovered some people, but they also have a danger.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The danger of the home meetings is that while the capable ones are holding back, those who speak nonsense will speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result of this situation is that nobody enjoys the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In my garden there was a piece of lawn where the old grass was not growing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers came to replace it for me, and they threw pieces of new sod here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After two to three months, these pieces of new sod all spread out and green grass grew everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a few years the grass will have no place to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then it will crowd itself out and it all will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this matter I learned a lesson that the church is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Taipei, at the beginning we threw pieces of sod out, but we did not have the assurance, for example, that the small meeting in Mu Zha was a church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We dared not say that the one in Shi Lin was a church or that the one in Pei Tao was a church, fearing that they would all be scattered by this kind of throwing out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But history tells us that the piece in Mu Zha became a church, the piece in Shi Lin became a church, and the piece in Pei Tao also became a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Originally we were extremely worried about the small number meeting in Yong Ho and expended much effort there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To our surprise, today Yong Ho is larger than hall one in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters in Yong Ho, if you do not spread further you will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today in the church in Taipei there is too much old grass crowding there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1949 we met first in hall one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The following year meeting halls were built.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately after the subdivision the small groups were established, group after group.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these pieces of sod were scattered and they grew very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later on we got distracted, and a group of young people were influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They began to have dissenting opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these circumstances the Lord led me to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since I arrived in the United States in 1960, three hundred fifty churches have been raised up in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet here in Asia we have degraded into the Christianity way of meeting, the way of emphasizing the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The meetings in homes and small groups were either put aside or disregarded.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We hoped that the big meetings would be attractive and that the number attending the big meetings would increase.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We gave message after message, expecting to raise up some capable speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this way did not bring in many and retained even fewer people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After twenty-seven years of labor the actual number of those attending the meetings was lower than it was over twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the history.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In these twenty-seven years many were baptized but they were not retained.</S>
