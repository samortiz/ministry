<P>The work of the first day was God's calling of light to come forth through His word. The initial work of the Spirit of God and the word of God cause light to shine out of darkness. Sin caused the eyes of man's heart to be darkened; it blinded the eyes of his understanding. If man stands alone without any help, he will never know that his position is perilous and his future is perdition. Spiritually speaking, he is completely blind, not knowing that he needs a Savior. The loves within his heart, the thoughts within his mind, and the decisions from his will do not afford him any light. But God's light can come and shine in his heart. Only God's light shining on the desolate scene can expose the real condition of the creature to the uttermost! Everything remains the same. The only thing that changes is darkness itself. Nothing that is exposed can please God's heart. The only thing good in God's eyes is His own light (Gen. 1:4). Within man, there is not one thing that can satisfy God or be acceptable to Him. Nevertheless, He delights in His beloved Son (Matt. 3:17), who is the true light of the world (John 1:9). Concerning the work that God did on the first day, the apostle said, "Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6). Just as God's light shined on the dark world before, today the Christ of God also shines in the dark and sinful heart.</P><P>Once man receives God's enlightenment, the light is divided from the darkness (Gen. 1:4). Thus, spiritual sense and knowledge are gradually recovered. The things a man once thought were right, he now realizes are wrong. What he formerly considered to be wrong, he now realizes to be right. Although in the experience of most people they do not have an accurate discernment right away, nevertheless, within their heart the division between light and darkness becomes a reality. At this time the word of God (through the light emitted from it) begins to divide man's bright spirit from his dark soul (Heb. 4:12). From this point on, within a person there is a division between "that which is born of the flesh is flesh" and "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:6). Although this division has yet to reach its perfect state and the believers have yet to experience it in full, in fact, the division between these two has been accomplished.</P><P>God divided the light from the darkness, and He gave light its position and named it light. Darkness was still there, and it also had its position and name (Gen. 1:5). Darkness is still darkness; in eternity it will still be darkness, and it will never change into light. The earth has never been the source of light. Whenever the earth turns its back to the light, it remains in darkness. When darkness is controlled by the light, it is powerless to do anything to lessen the brightness of light. Once light comes, darkness and shadows are gone. Both still exist as before. Our old nature (the flesh) and our old life (the soul) will always be darkness. However, whenever the spiritual life, the divine nature, is strengthened, the former things become completely powerless. However, if we do not walk in the light, we will do deeds of darkness once again. As long as we are in this world, we can always walk in the light. However, we can never eradicate the darkness completely nor can our sinful life and nature be changed. Although we are children of the day and children of light, we still have to walk in God's light. Otherwise, the night will return.</P><P>Strictly speaking, the day is not completely light. It is composed of "evening" and "morning" (v. 5). While we are on earth, the most noble life we can have is the "day." Nevertheless, it is still composed of "evening" and "morning." If there is only morning and no evening, that is not the "day" the Holy Scripture talks about. "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves" (1 John 1:8). "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar" (1 John 1:10).</P><P>Although darkness itself is "night," once the light comes in, darkness is no longer "night," but rather "the evening." Once God's light comes in, no matter how much darkness there is, the night cannot be night if there is a single beam of light. Since the night has some light, it should no longer be called night, but rather "the evening." After being enlightened by God's light, a believer's darkness still remains. It has not changed its nature. Yet after being enlightened, his darkness becomes a darkness that is under the control of the light; it is no longer without restriction. Sometimes his darkness may even be intensified; yet what he has is just the evening. It can no longer be completely "night," completely dark. Although sometimes he may fail completely and fall utterly, he cannot lose all of the light or the life that comes from the light. Neither can he revert to being an unbelieving sinner. Once a man believes in the Lord Jesus, he is born again; and once he is born again, he has the eternal life. He may fall, but he is still a son of God. While he may be occasionally overcome by trespasses (Gal. 6:1), they cannot cause him to return to a sinner's position. This is the grace of God!</P><P>In Genesis 1 it mentions "the evening and the morning" six times. Although the light is called "Day," during the six days it is referred to as "morning." The real experience of the "Day" has not yet come. Morning is only the beginning of the day; it is not the peak of light. In God's ordination, after evening there is morning. Although we have the dawning light, the time for this shining to shine "more and more unto the perfect day" (Prov. 4:18) is in the future. All we have today is the morning. One day, when God's work is completed and His heart is satisfied and at rest, the "perfect day" will appear. There will be no more evening or morning. We will enter into God's rest and eternally rejoice in the bright, nightless day. "Day to day pours forth speech, / And night to night tells out knowledge" (Psa. 19:2), yet those who hear and understand are few.</P><P>Indeed, the light we have now is only the "morning." The time when we will brightly shine is still in the future. At that time the temporal things will pass away, and we will enter into God's perfection.</P>
