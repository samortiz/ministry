   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us assume for now that a person has one hour a day to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He can allocate his time in the following way:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Twenty Minutes Studying by Subjects</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The experience of some people suggests that an hour of study can be divided into four sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first session of twenty minutes is for studying specific subjects like prophecies, types, parables, dispensations, the Lord's teachings on earth, or a specific book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One can read all the related passages and find the verses that deal with the subject chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If one is trying to study one book at a time, he should select the book he wants to study.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may choose Romans or the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After he finishes one book, he should go on to the next.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He should study the whole book and find out the content of each book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you decide to dedicate twenty minutes of your time each day to this kind of study, do not prolong or shorten it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must learn to restrict ourselves and never be a careless or loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Second Twenty Minutes Word Study</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second twenty minutes can be used for word study.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many special terms like reconciliation, blood, faith, joy, peace, hope, love, obedience, righteousness, redemption, mercy, etc., which are scattered throughout the Bible, and they all are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they are grouped and compiled together, we can get a better grasp of their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, we may study the word blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we should jot down all the chapters and verses that mention the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we should analyze the meaning of each occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What has the blood done for us before God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What type of persons does the blood deal with?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What and how much has the blood accomplished for us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old and New Testament, we can find many verses which speak of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can analyze them all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This cannot be accomplished in one sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One cannot hope to see much result on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he has access to a concordance, he can save much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Third Ten Minutes Gathering Information</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One can choose specific topics and spend the next ten minutes solely gathering information concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many topics in the Bible, such as creation, man, sin, salvation, repentance, the Holy Spirit, regeneration, sanctification, justification, forgiveness, freedom, the Body of Christ, the Lord's coming, judgment, the kingdom, eternity, etc. You can choose certain topics and then gather information about them from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The most one can handle at one time is five topics; if there are more than five topics, there will be too many clues, and it will be difficult to handle them all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not gather material for one topic alone; this is too time consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One may find material for more than one topic in a chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, you may be studying about the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the particular chapter you are on may not have anything on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But you can definitely find other topics in the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a bad idea to gather information on two, three, four, or five topics at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But do not take more than five at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Each topic may require some time to complete its study.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every day you have to add more material to your study.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Write down all the materials verses you have gathered, and from these write down the main words and meanings of each passage.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is useless to merely jot down the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must know what the verses are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose you are studying the Holy Spirit in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In writing down "sealed with the Holy Spirit" in 1:13, you should also write down the meaning of the word seal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, write down the verse, then the related terms, and finally the meaning of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should gather all the information this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day when you need to deal with such a topic, these materials will be on hand for you to apply.</S>
