   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO BE IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today many Christians are talking about the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But they do not know the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although they are talking about the church, they are not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without the churches, we cannot be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are you in it?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Were you in the church ten years ago, five years ago, five weeks ago?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past, we were not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were with other Christians, but deep within we realized that that gathering of Christians was not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the book of Revelation, the churches are not in the heavens; they are in cities on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are not in one of the churches, you are not in the church, no matter how much you talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To contact the church and be in it, you need the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ACCORDING TO ITS KIND</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider the type of the church in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God had created all the animals, He eventually created man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, God did not create a wife for man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He brought the living creatures to Adam and showed them to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam seemed to say, Those do not look like me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is a horse, that is a turtle, and that is a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the animals were presented to Adam one by one, he did not find one that could match him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A turtle is a turtle, a horse is a horse, and a wife is a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And I would also say that a denomination is a denomination, a free group is a free group, and a church is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past some dear friends tried their best to argue with me, saying, Brother Lee, you claim that you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why are we not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I answered them very simply and said, Don t you call yourselves Presbyterians and Baptists?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now you come to argue with me saying that you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are the church, why don t you call yourself the church?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then they said, The names Baptist and Presbyterian are merely denominational names.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They don t mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I replied, I am glad to hear that these names mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since they do not mean anything, why don t you drop them?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why still hold on to something that has no meaning?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They answered, Brother Lee, how can we drop these names?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I pointed out that their words were contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, they said that the name meant nothing; on the other hand, they said that they could not drop their names.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then I asked, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are the church, then say you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose a woman wearing a name tag that says Mrs. Jones comes to you and claims to be Mrs. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would say, If you are Mrs. Smith, why do you bear the name of Mrs. Jones? If you say that this is just a name and that it means nothing, then I would tell you to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you find it difficult to drop that name, it must prove that you are Mrs. Jones, not Mrs. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers, if you are the church, why do you call yourselves Presbyterians, Baptists, and Lutherans?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day I pointed out to a friend that there was a group called the Church of England in China and that there was a group called the Chinese Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What confusion this is!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Genesis 1, everything is after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A sheep is after its kind, a horse is after its kind, and an ox is after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But what are the Church of England in China and the Chinese Presbyterian Church in the United States of America?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They certainly are not according to their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The head of the Church of England is the Queen, and every British subject is considered a member of the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to be a member of the Church of England, there is no need to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Natural birth is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is such a thing the church?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is it according to its kind?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>WHY WE SAY THAT WE ARE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>IN A CERTAIN LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1963 I was invited to speak to a group of Christians in Missouri.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the end of one of the meetings, my host asked me, Brother Lee, why do you call yourselves the church in Los Angeles?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I said, The church in Los Angeles includes all the saints in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But so many of them do not meet with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, they stay with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only a small number are willing to meet with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Consider the example of the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose the Smith family has twenty-six members and that nineteen of them have left the family.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only seven remain at home.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Are those seven not the Smith family?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they are not the Smith family, then what are they?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We realize that all the Christians in Los Angeles are part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But most do not want to be with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thousands are in the Catholic Church and in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we, the small number who want to remain in the church, do not call ourselves the church, then what would you call us?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Give us a name.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Any name you give us will simply cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>So many members of the Smith family have gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some have gone to the movies, others to the seashore, and others to the dance hall.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only seven are at home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Nevertheless, those seven certainly are the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They had to admit that we were right in saying that we are the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, after that time, some began to doubt, saying, Is that really the Smith family?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Smith family includes twenty-six members.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How can those seven say that they are the Smith family?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers, this is a day of confusion and division, and we must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must know how to discern what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need the local church in order to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many of us can testify what a blessing it has been to touch the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We can testify that we are in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not care for the number.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even if the Smith family has only a few members remaining, they are still the Smith family.</S>
