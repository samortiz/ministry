Eventually, He reached the point where He did not talk to them any further. Rather, in chapter twenty-three, He gave them a final word....In His rebuke of the Jewish religionists, the Lord first spoke against their hypocrisy (23:1-12). [He exposed their hypocrisy in the following areas: 1) seating themselves in Moses&#8217; seat and saying but not doing (vv. 2-3); 2) binding heavy burdens and laying them on the shoulders of others, but not moving them with their finger (v. 4); 3) doing all their works to be seen by men (v. 5a); 4) broadening their phylacteries and enlarging the fringes of their garments (v. 5b); 5) loving the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues (v. 6); 6) loving the salutations in the market places and being called Rabbi by men (v. 7); and 7) a behavior that is in contrast to the humility of the kingdom people (vv. 8-12)].</p><p>In 23:13-36 the Lord pronounces an eightfold woe upon the scribes and Pharisees. In chapter five we have a ninefold blessing, but here we have an eightfold woe.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s rebuke of the scribes and Pharisees affords us an accurate picture of today&#8217;s religion. Everything found in 23:1-36 resembles the situation today. Remember, this rebuke is found in the book of the kingdom. Matthew&#8217;s intention is certainly to present the negative in order to reveal the positive. The kingdom life must be the opposite of what is exposed in 23:1-36. It must be an absolute contrast to this black and hellish picture. Only by the mercy and grace of the Lord can we escape the situation portrayed here. Thus, we all need to pray, &#8220;O Lord, save me! Rescue me! Take me away from this terrible situation.&#8221; (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 699, 702, 705)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>2<sup>1</sup> ...Those who knew the Scriptures (Ezra 7:6).</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> The Pharisees were the strictest religious sect of the Jews (Acts 26:5). This sect was formed about 200 B.C. They were proud of their superior religious living, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures. Actually, they had degraded into pretension and hypocrisy (23:2-33).</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> Phylacteries are small leather boxes containing parts of the law written on parchment. According to Deut. 6:8 and 11:18, they were worn on the forehead as a frontlet and on the left arm. The scribes and the Pharisees broadened them and considered them a charm.</p><p>5<sup>2</sup> The law required the Israelites to make fringes on the borders of their garments with a band of blue. The fringes signified that their conduct (typified by the garment) was regulated by the heavenly rule (indicated by the band of blue), and they were to be a reminder to them to keep God&#8217;s commandments (Num. 15:38-39). The scribes and Pharisees enlarged the fringes, pretending that they were keeping God&#8217;s commandments and were being regulated by them to a surpassing degree.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 699-705; Hymns: #944</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
