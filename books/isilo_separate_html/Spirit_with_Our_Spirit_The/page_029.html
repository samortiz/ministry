Ranked as the Second in the Divine Trinity</H2><P>In Revelation 1 the sevenfold Spirit is ranked as the second in the Divine Trinity instead of the third, indicating the intensification of the Spirit (vv. 4-5a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. As the Seven Lamps Burning<br>before the Throne of God</H2><P>Revelation 4:5 says that the seven Spirits are the seven lamps burning before the throne of God to carry out the divine administration for the consummation of the divine economy. God's administration today is not weak. The administration of God today on this earth to accomplish His economy is strong in a sevenfold way. The sevenfold Spirit is the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God to direct the world situation in order to execute God's economy in the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. As the Seven Eyes of the Lamb</H2><P>The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the observing parts of our Redeemer, to observe all the churches in all the nations for the building up of His Body to consummate the building up of the New Jerusalem, accomplishing the eternal economy of God (Rev. 5:6; 21:1-3). Eventually, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, has become the sevenfold Spirit as the seven eyes of the Lamb. This exposes the wrong teaching that Christ and the Spirit are separate. The seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ. How could your eyes be separate from you? They are a part of you. A person's eyes are for observing and transfusing. When you look at someone, you observe him and your looking at him transfuses something of you into him. The sevenfold Spirit today is the eyes of our Savior. He observes us and transfuses all His riches into us by His seven eyes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Be the Speaking Spirit to All the Churches</H2><P>The sevenfold intensified Spirit is the speaking Spirit to all the churches. The Lord's epistles to the seven churches are in Revelation 2 and 3. At the beginning of each epistle, it was the Lord Jesus speaking (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14), yet at the end of each epistle it says that whoever has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to all the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).</P><P>He is the speaking Spirit in the beginning of the book of Revelation. Then He becomes the consummated Spirit as the totality of the Triune God at the end of Revelation. Today He speaks to the churches, but at the end He and the church speak together, and the church is His bride (Rev. 22:17a). The processed Triune God consummated as the Spirit is married to the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, glorified tripartite man as His wife. The Triune God and the tripartite man become a married couple. The New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the Bible is the marriage life of the processed God married to the transformed man. They live together as a couple in eternity, and their life is portrayed in full in the New Jerusalem.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
