Verse 51 says, “And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.” This signifies that the separation between God and man had been abolished because the flesh of sin (the flesh being signified by the veil) taken by Christ (Rom. 8:3) had been crucified (Heb. 10:20 and note 2).…Now the way to enter into the presence of God is open for us. What a wonderful effect of the Lord’s death! His death was not martyrdom; it was an act of redemption.</p><p>[Matthew 27:51] also says that “the earth was shaken and the rocks were split.” The shaking of the earth signifies that the base of Satan’s rebellion was shaken, and the splitting of the rocks signifies that the strongholds of Satan’s earthly kingdom were broken. Hallelujah, the Lord’s death tore the veil, shook the base of Satan’s rebellion, and broke the strongholds of Satan’s kingdom! What a death! Praise the Lord for His death! Because God’s righteousness was fully satisfied, Christ’s death could be so effective.</p><p>[In verse 52] the opening of the tombs signifies that the power of death and Hades was conquered and subdued, and the raising of the bodies of the saints signifies the releasing power of the death of Christ. Verse 53 says that they came out of the tombs after His resurrection and entered into the holy city and appeared to many. In the type, the firstfruits of the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11) were not a single stalk of wheat but a sheaf of wheat, typifying not only the resurrected Christ but also the saints who were raised from the dead after His resurrection, as seen here.…The Roman centurion and guards testified that Jesus was truly God’s Son when they saw what happened at the death of Christ (v. 54).</p><p>Verses 57 through 66 reveal that the Lord Jesus was buried by a rich man.…This righteous One was surely worthy of such a burial.</p><p>After the Lord Jesus was buried, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate and asked him to secure the grave until the third day (vv. 62-64). [This securing was] probably by a cord stretched across the stone and sealed at both ends (see Dan. 6:17). On the negative side, this sealing was intended by the opposing Jewish leaders to be a precaution, but on the positive side, it turned out to be a strong testimony of the Lord’s resurrection. Without such a sealing, the resurrection of Christ would not have been as significant.

Joseph, a rich man (Matt. 27:57), and Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews (John 3:1), came to take care of His burial, binding His body with myrrh and aloes and burying it in a new tomb with the rich (Isa. 53:9). In human honor of a high standard, the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to rise from the dead.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 812-814; Hymns: #1089, #169 (vv. 1, 3, 5)</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
