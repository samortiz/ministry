   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX GETTING RID OF THE LEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND NOT TURNING FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>INTO AN OCCASION FOR THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Gal 5:7-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we saw that Paul spoke to the Galatian believers about not being brought to nothing from Christ 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was Paul s first charge related to the daily walk of the heirs of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider the second and third charges respectively: the charge to get rid of the leaven and not to turn freedom into an occasion, an opportunity, for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. GETTING RID OF THE LEAVEN A. Not Dissuaded from Obeying the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 5:7 and 8 Paul says, You were running well; who hindered you that you should not obey the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This persuasion is not of Him Who calls you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 4:20 Paul told the Galatians that he was perplexed about them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here in 5:7 and 8 Paul assumes a rather mild tone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He praises them by saying that they were running well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he asks them who hindered them that they should not obey the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Truth here does not refer to doctrine, but refers to the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these verses it is difficult to tell whether Paul is mild or bold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, he praises them, but, on the other hand, he seems to rebuke them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In talking to the Galatian believers Paul was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 5:8 Paul says, This persuasion is not of Him Who calls you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The persuasion Paul mentions here is that of the Judaizers teaching, which was distracting the Galatians from Christ to the observances of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This persuasion was not of God, the One who had called them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, it must have been from another source, from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul s word here is a strong indication that the Judaizers were one with Satan in acting against God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may apply this principle to our situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The persuasive talk of the opposers and the dissenting ones is not of the One who has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, its source must be Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Be careful when listening to the persuasive speech of dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not just listen to their words, but check whether or not their speech is of the One who has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Discern whether or not their persuasive talk is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not be misled by pleasant words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Deceivers are often sweet talkers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They use soothing, comforting, enticing words in their attempt to persuade you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But concealed within these words there is poison.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Speaking with sugar-coated words, the dissenting ones may try to entice the weak ones away from the enjoyment of Christ and from the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such talk is not of the One who called us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It issues from another source, from Satan, God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The goal of this persuasion is to bring us to nothing from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Beware of the subtlety of the enemy behind this kind of persuasion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. Not Allowing a Little Leaven</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>to Leaven the Whole Lump</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Leaven here refers to the false teachings of the Judaizers see Matt 16:12 , and the lump, to all the believers collectively.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The whole lump is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, Paul did not regard the false teachings of the Judaizers merely as a small amount of leaven, a little leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certain of the Galatian believers, however, may have considered the persuasive speech of the Judaizers as something rather small.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, Paul pointed out that even a little leaven leavens the whole lump.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In his subtle strategy, Satan uses the opposing ones and the dissenting ones to inject a little leaven through their persuasive speech.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This leaven works as an appetizer that stirs up our desire in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The negative points covered in the first four chapters of Galatians were not merely a little leaven, but a large amount of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in dealing with those believers who had been distracted by the teaching of the Judaizers, Paul speaks in a careful way and refers to a little leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether the amount is large or small, leaven is leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Leaven is like germs in that it multiplies; it causes the whole lump to be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to learn from the experience of the Galatians not to open ourselves to even a little leaven, for a little leaven is capable of leavening the whole church.</S>
