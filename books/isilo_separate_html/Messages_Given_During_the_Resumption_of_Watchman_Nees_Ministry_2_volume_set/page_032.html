This word is very crucial. The Bible mentions image many times. The main thing this word reveals to us is the relationship between God and man. When many people think about salvation, they think about forgiveness of sins, the receiving of blessings, and so forth. But God did not create man just for him to receive blessings and to be forgiven of his sins. The first thought God has with man is that He wants man to be like Him. The first time the Bible mentions man and the creation of man, it mentions him having the image of God.</P><P>Genesis 2 mentions the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The first chapter mentions image, and the second chapter mentions the tree of life. I hope that you will circle the words image and the tree of life with a red pen. Image is something outside, whereas life is something inside. First it speaks of the outside, and then it speaks of the inside. This is like saying that you have the image of a Chinese outside, and you have the life of a Chinese inside. Without having God's life inside him, man cannot have God's image. Life is the content, and in this life there is God's nature. When this life is expressed, we have God's image.</P><P>I want to ask the brothers and sisters a question: Why do you believe in Jesus? Many people answer that it is because they have sinned, or that they were poor and suffering, and they needed something to depend on. All of these are right answers, but this kind of understanding is too shallow and elementary.</P><P>In God's creation, the earth is the center of the heavens, and the garden of Eden is the center of the earth. In the midst of the garden, there was the tree of life. God put man in the center of the center. He did not put man in the heavens, nor did He put man on the fringes. Rather, He put man in the center. In this center, there was man, and there were the two trees. Both trees speak of food. The tree of life is a matter of food, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is also a matter of food. We know that when food gets into a man, it becomes a part of him. I hope that tonight we will put aside matters such as heaven, hell, blessings, and sufferings. Let us set our hearts on two things: image and the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TREE OF LIFE BRINGING IN LIFE, WHEREAS<br>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br>BRINGING IN DEATH</H2><P>In Hebrew, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is composed of three words: knowledge, good, and evil. Life is simply life; it is unique. But God cannot say that evil is good, or that good is evil. Other than knowledge, good, and evil, there is still another thing, which is death. Good and evil bring in death. Today, in order to gain God, we have to be pure. The meaning of being pure is to have one thing only. What we take into us is life, and what is lived out of us is the image. If it is life for us all the way from the beginning to the end and we have nothing besides life, we are being pure. When man joins himself to the knowledge of good and evil, he falls into death, and he becomes complicated. The tree of knowledge can be called the tree of good, and it can also be called the tree of evil. Humanly speaking, the tree of good and the tree of knowledge sound very nice, and the tree of evil and the tree of death sound very bad. But in the whole universe, nothing other than life is according to God's will. Everything outside of life is in the realm of knowledge, good, evil, and death. Today, man thinks that good is life, and evil is death. When man touches evil, he touches death. But when he touches good, does he not touch death also? When he touches knowledge, does he not touch death also? I have to shout loudly that the result of good and knowledge is also death.</P><P>If someone hates you, or he is proud, this is to be evil. But if he loves you, and he is humble, this is to be good. On the one hand, the Bible teaches us to love our parents and our brothers and sisters. But on the other hand, Luke 14 tells us to hate our parents and our brothers and sisters. God's intention has nothing to do with good and evil; it has to do with life. God has no intention for us to do evil, and He has no intention for us to do good. You cannot please God by doing evil, and you cannot please God by doing good, because both good and evil come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Whether you are proud or humble, the source is the same, and the end is death.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
