[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1
[2]  In studying the Bible, the book of books, we need to be clear that the Bible is not a book of doctrine.
[3]  For this life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see what is revealed in these two books.
[4]  In 1 and 2 Samuel there are four main persons Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David and at this point I would like to say a brief word about each of them.
[5]  The central thought of 1 and 2 Samuel is that the fulfillment of God's economy needs man's cooperation, as illustrated by the history of Samuel's mother Hannah, Samuel, and David, in the positive sense, and by the history of Eli and Saul, in the negative sense.
[6]  Hence, 1 and 2 Samuel are a continuation of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, giving us the details concerning the enjoyment of the God-given good land.
[7]  The books of 1 and 2 Samuel have three sections: the history concerning Samuel 1 Sam 1 8 , the history concerning Saul 1 Sam 9 15 , and the history concerning David 1 Sam 16 2 Sam 24 .
[8]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWO THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAMUEL 1 HIS ORIGIN, BIRTH, AND YOUTH Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1:1 2:11, 18-21, 26
[9]  In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Samuel, beginning with his origin, birth, and youth.
[10]  Humanly speaking, Samuel's origin was his God-worshipping parents vv.
[11]  The line of life is a line to bring forth Christ for the enjoyment of God's people that on earth God may have His kingdom, which is the Body of Christ, the very organism of the Triune God.
[12]  The origin of Samuel was especially his God-seeking mother with her prayer vv.
[13]  "In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel, For, she said, I asked for him of Jehovah" v. 20 . This verse speaks of Samuel's birth, which came through God's answer to man's prayer.
[14]  THE STALE AND WANING AARONIC PRIESTHOOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1:25; 2:11b, 12-17, 22-25, 27-36; 3:4-18; 4:1-22
[15]  The elders said, "Let us take unto us the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from Shiloh that it may be in our midst, and thus save us from the hand of our enemies" v. 3b . When the ark came into the camp, the people were glad and "all Israel shouted with a great shout" v. 5 . They trusted in the system ordained by God, but they did not trust in God directly.
[16]  Eventually, the ark of God, which had been with the children of Israel for at least 400 years, was captured by the winning Philistines, indicating that the glory had departed from Israel 4:9-22 .
[17]  In this message we will begin to consider Samuel's ministry.
[18]  Under God's sovereignty, Samuel was given to God by his mother, he grew up under the custody of Eli, he was educated and perfected, and his eyes were opened to see both positive and negative things.
[19]  Samuel, who was by nature a Levite born of one of the descendants of the great rebel Korah 1 Chron 6:33-38; cf.
[20]  Samuel ministered, or served, not only as a priest but also as a prophet.
[21]  a. At the Time: 1 When the Word of Jehovah Was Rare
[22]  A priest served God, a prophet spoke for God, and a judge carried out God's governmental administration.
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE SIX THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAMUEL 5 HIS MINISTRY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 8
[24]  In this message we will continue to consider the history concerning Samuel's ministry.
[25]  However, they did not follow in his ways v. 3a but went after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice v. 3b . This was evil in the sight of God Exo 18:21; 23:8; Deut 16:19 and contrary to their father's pure and just way in his whole life 1 Sam 12:3-5 . Hence, the sons of Samuel should not be considered judges among the people of Israel, and their father Samuel should be considered the last judge.
[26]  The people of Israel not only displeased Samuel but also offended God by rejecting Him as their King for a replacement.
[27]  In this message I would like to give a further word on Samuel and his ministry.
[28]  At the end of his ministry, by the time that Saul was raised up to be the king in Israel 9:3 10:27 , Samuel had reached the highest position.
[29]  When someone attains a high position, there is always a question as to whether he will allow someone else to come in to match him or to be above him.
[30]  Some Bible students have pointed out that Samuel was a person of high character.
[31]  God's anointing of Saul happened by Saul's meeting Samuel under God's arrangement and God's call through Samuel vv.
[32]  "Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and he kissed him and said, Has not Jehovah anointed you as prince over His inheritance?"
[33]  When Saul's uncle checked with Saul where he had gone with his servant, Saul told him that they had gone to look for the donkeys, and when they were not to be found, they went to Samuel v. 14 . Then Saul's uncle said that he should tell him what Samuel said to him.
[34]  Verses 17 through 27 give an account of how Saul was made king by Samuel.
[35]  Samuel gathered the people together to Jehovah at Mizpah v. 17 . This indicates that Saul was made king by Samuel before, in the sight of, the people of Israel.
[36]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE NINE THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL 2 SAUL'S CONQUEST OF THE AMMONITES
[37]  As we read the history recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel, we need to realize that, no matter what was happening, God was behind the scene directing everything.
[38]  I. SAUL'S CONQUEST OF THE AMMONITES A. The Threatening and Reproach of the Ammonites
[39]  After Saul was anointed king, the Ammonites came to threaten and reproach the children of Israel 11:1-5 .
[40]  God sent the Spirit to rush upon Saul v. 6 , and he was empowered by God.
[41]  There at Gilgal Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly v. 15 . Although Saul had been victorious over the Ammonites and appeared to be such an attractive, humble person, according to Samuel the nation of Israel was still not the kingdom of God on earth.
[42]  This reminder implies a comparison between Samuel and Saul.
[43]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL 3 SAUL'S CONQUEST OF THE PHILISTINES Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 13 14
[44]  Saul first conquered the Ammonites, and then he conquered the Philistines, Israel's most difficult enemy.
[45]  Saul's disobedience resulted in his losing his kingship vv.
[46]  Samuel went on to say to Saul, "Jehovah has sought a man according to His heart for Himself, and Jehovah has appointed him as leader over His people" v. 14b . Here Samuel was referring to David, to whom God would shift the kingship.
[47]  Verses 16 through 23 describe the conquest of the Philistines under Saul.
[48]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE ELEVEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL 4 SAUL'S DISOBEDIENCE
[49]  IN HIS CONQUEST OF THE AMALEKITES Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 15
[50]  Here Saul was absolutely, thoroughly exposed, and then he was given up by God and also by Samuel.
[51]  After Joshua defeated Amalek, God declared that He would "have war with Amalek from generation to generation" v. 16 . This shows how seriously God regarded the frustration caused by the Amalekites.
[52]  Saul summoned the people and mustered them, 200,000 footmen and 10,000 men of Judah v. 4 . Saul then came to the city of the Amalekites and set an ambush in the river valley v. 5 . Before striking the Amalekites, Saul sent the Kenites away from the destruction of the Amalekites, for they showed kindness to the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt v. 6 . Then Saul struck the Amalekites and captured Agag their king vv.
[53]  It was told Samuel that Saul had gone to Carmel and had set up a monument for himself v. 12 . Saul built this monument not for the kingdom of God but for the remembrance of himself because of the victory that made both him and his monarchy rich.
[54]  Saul confessed his sin to Samuel with the excuse that he had transgressed the commandment of Jehovah and Samuel's words because he "feared the people and obeyed their voice" v. 24 .
[55]  Samuel never again saw Saul unto the day of his death, though Samuel mourned for Saul, because Jehovah repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.
[56]  First Samuel 16 begins the history concerning David as one prepared by God as a man according to the heart of God.
[57]  This shows that while Saul was abusing the God-given kingship, God knew the whole situation and was doing something marvelous to prepare the right person.
[58]  Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have selected for Myself a king from among his sons" v. 1 . Jesse had seven of his sons pass by Samuel, but Jehovah had not chosen them.
[59]  David's family seemed not to care for him, but God was determined to use him, for He had chosen him.
[60]  In verses 14 through 23 we see that the anointing of David was confirmed also from the negative side.
[61]  In chapter seventeen David was tested and approved in trusting God and defeating Goliath.
[62]  Verses 12 through 54 give us a detailed account of David's defeating of Goliath.
[63]  Because his experience as a shepherd had trained him to trust in the Lord, David could say to Saul, "Jehovah, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine" v. 37a . When Saul heard this, he said to David, "Go, and may Jehovah be with you" v. 37b . Then Saul put his armor on him, but David tried it and took it off vv.
[64]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 2 PREPARED BY GOD
[65]  Jonathan and David made a covenant, something that was to be kept and fulfilled to the uttermost v. 3a .
[66]  Saul took David and would not let him return to his father's house v. 2 . This is a further indication that God had prepared all the details concerning David's environment.
[67]  As David returned from striking the Philistines, the women came out of all the towns of Israel to meet Saul and they said, "Saul has stricken down his thousands;/But David, his ten thousands" v. 7 . When Saul heard this praise, he was displeased and said, "They ascribe ten thousands to David, but to me they ascribe only thousands.
[68]  He only fled v. 11b . Saul was afraid of David, for Jehovah was with David and had departed from Saul v. 12 . If Saul had learned to know the flesh, he would have worshipped the Lord for choosing David.
[69]  When Saul learned that another daughter, Michal, loved David, Saul plotted to give her to David as wife that she might be a snare to him v. 21 . Saul's giving of Michal to David was on the term that David would give him a hundred Philistine foreskins vv.
[70]  Saul not only plotted to have David killed but determined to kill him 19:1-7 .
[71]  Saul tried to strike David to the wall while David was playing the lyre to Saul when Saul was troubled by an evil spirit from God vv.
[72]  He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?
[73]  David went up from the wilderness of Ziph and remained in the strongholds of En-gedi v. 29 . When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told where David was, and Saul took three thousand choice men and went to seek David 24:1-2 .
[74]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE FIFTEEN GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY
[75]  AND DAVID'S TAKING THE LESSONS OF THE CROSS Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 18 24
[76]  In His sovereignty God not only prepared Saul to perfect David but also prepared Jonathan, the son of Saul, and Michal, the daughter of Saul who became David's wife, to help David.
[77]  The second striking point in this section of 1 Samuel is David's taking the lessons of the cross.
[78]  In particular, we need to have the view of one who sees God's sovereignty and who has received the grace to learn to suffer under the cross while enjoying all the provisions afforded by the processed, consummated Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[79]  If we have such a spirit, then in the record concerning David's trials under Saul we will see the Triune God, the cross of Christ, and the power of His resurrection.
[80]  Samuel was deeply disappointed with Saul's kingship and mourned for Saul 15:35 .
[81]  Samuel mourned to such an extent that eventually God said to him, "How long will you mourn for Saul, though I have rejected him from being king over Israel?"
[82]  According to chapter twenty-six Jehovah delivered Saul into the hand of David, but David would not kill him because of his fear of God in that Saul was God's anointed.
[83]  Even though Saul was wicked, he was still human and was touched by David's word and repented vv.
[84]  God is carrying out His economy on earth, and He brought Saul into His economy.
[85]  God wanted to build up His kingdom among His chosen people, but Saul usurped God's kingdom to build up his own monarchy.
[86]  In 1 Samuel 28:3-25 we see that Saul's tragic end was pretold by Samuel.
[87]  First Samuel 28:3a tells us that Samuel was dead and that all Israel had mourned for him and had buried him in his own city, Ramah.
[88]  Samuel told Saul that Jehovah had turned away from him and had become his adversary v. 16 . Then Samuel told Saul that Jehovah had torn the kingdom out from his hand and had given it to David, an associate of his v. 17 . Finally, Samuel told Saul that Jehovah would also give Israel with Saul into the hand of the Philistines and that the next day he and his sons would be destroyed v. 19 .
[89]  The soul of all the people was bitter, and they spoke of stoning David, but he "strengthened himself in Jehovah his God" v. 6b . Following this, he told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod to him, and he inquired of Jehovah, saying, "Shall I pursue after this band? Will I overtake them?" Jehovah said to him, "Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly deliver them" v. 8 . Then David and four hundred of his men pursued the Amalekites, with the assistance of a young man of Egypt who was a servant of an Amalekite.
[90]  If Saul had had the proper view regarding the kingdom of God, he would have realized that David, a skilled and vigorous fighter, could have been of great help to him in defeating the Philistines for the building up of the kingdom of God.
[91]  At the time of chapter thirty-one, the Philistines were fighting against Israel v. 1a .
[92]  In 2 Samuel 1 we see David's reaction to the death of Saul.
[93]  In order to please David he told him that he saw Saul leaning on his spear and that Saul had asked him to kill him and that he had done so vv.
[94]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE NINETEEN LESSONS OF THE FIVE MAJOR FIGURES
[95]  The books of Samuel, as books of history, are on Christ for our enjoyment that God may carry out His economy.
[96]  In the long period of history covered in 1 Samuel 1 to 2 Samuel 1, there are five major figures: Eli, Samuel, Jonathan, Saul, and David.
[97]  LESSONS OF JONATHAN THE SON OF SAUL A. Loving David and Covenanting with Him
[98]  Jonathan loved David, covenanted with him, and predicted that he would be the second in David's kingdom when David would be the king 18:1-4; 19:1-7; 20:8, 14-17, 41-42; 23:16-18 .
[99]  LESSONS OF SAUL A. Chosen by God and Anointed by Samuel
[100]  Saul was chosen by God and anointed by Samuel to be the king of Israel 9:17; 10:1, 24 .
[101]  Saul was not subordinate to God and in fact became an enemy to God.
[102]  D. Not Destroying Saul because of His Fear of God
[103]  When David was under Saul's persecution, he had two chances to destroy Saul.
[104]  Although David had slain Goliath, the giant of the Philistines, and could have been useful to Saul in utterly defeating the Philistines, Saul would not use David to accomplish this but instead persecuted him.
[105]  In verses 8 through 10a we see that Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, at the age of forty rivaled David in the kingship.
[106]  Abner said to Ish-bosheth, "May God do so to Abner, and even more, if I do not do for David as Jehovah has sworn to him; to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba!" vv.
[107]  He told them that Jehovah had spoken of David, saying, "By My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies" v. 18 . David held a feast for Abner and for the men who were with him, and Abner said to David, "I will rise up and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you and that you may reign over all that your soul desires" v. 21 .
[108]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 8 CROWNED BY THE PEOPLE TO BE THE KING
[109]  In this message we will continue to consider the matters related to David's being crowned by the tribe of Judah, in particular the matter of the war between the house of Saul and the house of David 2:1 4:12 .
[110]  Then we will see that David was crowned by the other tribes 5:1-5 and established by God as king with his kingdom exalted for the sake of God's people Israel vv.
[111]  The first of these is recorded in verses 6 through 8, where we see that David was established by God in his victory over the Jebusites.
[112]  David's being established by God is seen also in the building of Zion as his stronghold and of Jerusalem v. 9 . Furthermore, "David became greater and greater; and Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him" v. 10 . This indicates that David had God's presence.
[113]  Finally, David's being established by God was seen in his repeated victories over the Philistines vv.
[114]  When David inquired of Jehovah, asking whether he should go up against the Philistines, Jehovah said to him, "Go up, for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand" v. 19 . David struck the Philistines and said, "Jehovah has broken forth upon my enemies before me like the breaking forth of a flood" v. 20b . David continued to do as Jehovah had commanded him and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.
[115]  As we will see, in chapter six David took care of the habitation of the ark of God, and in chapter seven he wanted to build a house for God.
[116]  The ark, which was made of acacia wood covered with gold, was a type of Christ as the embodiment of the moving and working God.
[117]  As a man who was according to God's heart, David knew that God desired to have His own home.
[118]  from the House of Obed-edom to His City, Zion
[119]  When she saw King David leaping and dancing before Jehovah, she despised him in her heart v. 16 . After David blessed the people, he returned to bless his household, and Michal went forth to meet him and mocked him, saying, "How the king of Israel has made himself honorable today, uncovering himself today in the sight of the maids of his servants as some worthless fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!" v. 20 . David replied, "It was before Jehovah, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; so I played before Jehovah" v. 21 . The chapter concludes by saying that Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death v. 23 . Her mocking of David brought upon her the curse of childlessness.
[120]  In this message we will see that, according to chapter seven, David wanted to build a house for God.
[121]  God told David that since the time He brought Israel up out of Egypt, He had never asked anyone to build Him a house that He might dwell in it.
[122]  God charged Nathan to tell David that He took him from the pasture, from following the sheep, that he might be ruler over His people Israel v. 8 . Also, God had been with David in every place and had cut off all his enemies v. 9a . This refers to the presence of God.
[123]  God said that He would appoint a place for His people Israel and plant them, that they might dwell in their own place without disturbances and without being ill-treated by the sons of wickedness v. 10 . David's heart was to get a place for God to dwell in, but God's heart is to get a place for His people to be settled and even planted.
[124]  God told David that He would give him rest from all his enemies v. 11a . Here God seemed to be saying, "David, you have a heart for Me. My heart is for you, and I want you to have rest from all the enemies that are around you."
[125]  Jehovah declared to David that He would make him a house v. 11b . When we love the Lord, we may feel that we should do something for Him.
[126]  In 2 Samuel 7:12 God was actually telling David that instead of building something for God, he needed God to build His Son into him.
[127]  The Son of God must become our seed, yet He remains the Son of God.
[128]  Second Samuel 7:14b-15 says that if David's seed referring to the one other than Christ, that is, Solomon committed iniquity, God would strike him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men.
[129]  Second Samuel 7 is a very difficult portion of the Word to understand, and not many Christians have the proper view concerning it.
[130]  My first impression was that here we see the love and kindness of God in wanting to build David a house instead of having David build a house for Him.
[131]  Thus, 2 Samuel 7 is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us there is no need for us to build something for God.
[132]  If we build the church with wood, grass, and stubble with the attainments that come from our natural background or with the natural way of living we will mar the church v. 17 . We should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones, signifying respectively God, Christ, and the Spirit.
[133]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE SEED OF DAVID AND THE SON OF GOD Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Rom 1:3-4; Eph 3:17; John 14:23
[134]  In 2 Samuel 7:12-14a Jehovah said to David, "When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
[135]  Here Paul says, "Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[136]  In 2 Samuel 7 we see that David had a good heart toward God and wanted to build a house for God.
[137]  IN LIFE AND IN NATURE BUT NOT IN THE GODHEAD
[138]  Athanasius referred to deification when at the council of Nicea in A.D. 325 he said, "He Christ was made man that we might be made God." Although the term deification is familiar to many theologians and Christian teachers, during the past sixteen centuries only a small number have dared to teach regarding the deification of the believers in Christ.
[139]  I have not been influenced by any teaching about deification, but I have learned from my study of the Bible that God does intend to make the believers God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.
[140]  Just as the photograph of a person does not have the life and nature of that person, so David, a photograph of God's heart, did not have the life and nature of God.
[141]  In and through resurrection Christ, the firstborn Son of God, became the life-giving Spirit, who now enters into us to impart, to dispense, Himself as life into our being to be our inner constitution, to make us a God-man just like Him.
[142]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX GOD'S BUILDING HIMSELF IN CHRIST
[143]  Transformation is a metabolic process that changes us by adding some new element into our being and discharging the old element.
[144]  We need to have the proper understanding of the building up of the Body of Christ.
[145]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN A PROPHECY CONCERNING THE SEED OF DAVID
[146]  Eventually, this human seed becomes the Son of God v. 14 . Concerning this, the Lord Jesus asked a question of the Pharisees Matt 22:41-45 . First, He asked them, "What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?" v. 42 . When they said that Christ was David's son, the Lord Jesus went on to ask how David could call Him Lord v. 43 . Finally, He said, "If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" v. 45 . This is the greatest question in the universe.
[147]  Colossians 1:12 tells us that Christ is God's allotted portion to us, and verse 15 says that this Christ is "the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation."
[148]  God is the Creator, and Christ is the image of the Creator.
[149]  Both John 20 and Luke 24 provide evidence that Christ was resurrected with a body.
[150]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT GOD'S DESIRE TO BUILD HIMSELF INTO US
[151]  After God gained Abraham, He gave him the promise of the good land and of a descendant to enjoy the land.
[152]  David wanted to build a house for God, but God stopped him and told him that He would build a house, a family, for David, and out of that building He would give him a seed.
[153]  At the time of David, the divine revelation reached the point where God showed David what He wanted.
[154]  God revealed to David that He could not be satisfied simply to have a man who was according to His heart.
[155]  Rather, God indicated to David that He wants to build Himself into the man who is according to His heart and to make this man His building as His house.
[156]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE GOD'S INTENTION
[157]  TO BUILD HIMSELF IN CHRIST INTO US Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:11b-14a; Isa 11:1; Eph 3:17; John 14:23; 1 Cor 3:10-12; Rev 21:2-3, 9, 12-14
[158]  God desires not mainly to do things for us but to work Himself into our being.
[159]  According to the common understanding and view among Christians, God gave Christ to be our Redeemer and our Savior.
[160]  God reacted by saying to David through Nathan the prophet, "Will it be you who builds Me a house to dwell in?" v. 5 . God went on to reveal to David, through a prophecy in typology, that His intention was not that David would build a house for Him but that He would build Himself into David.
[161]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE THIRTY THE UNIQUE WORK OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD
[162]  BUILDING HIMSELF INTO OUR BEING Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:11b-14a; John 14:23; Eph 3:16-17; Matt 13:3, 8, 23; Matt 16:18; Rev 21:2, 9-10, 12, 14, 22
[163]  We thank the Lord that, throughout the years, He has opened His Word to us and has been speaking to us in His recovery.
[164]  The Bible tells us that God is working in us and that Christ is living in us.
[165]  In Ephesians 3:16-17 Paul prayed to the Father, saying, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith."
[166]  Our Need to Be Strengthened into Our Inner Man
[167]  Since God's building Himself in Christ into us depends not only on Himself as the element but also on the nutrients supplied by us, we need to be strengthened into our inner man.
[168]  This power, referred to in Ephesians 1:19-22, is the power that raised Christ from the dead, seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Christ's feet, and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.
[169]  OF GOD'S BUILDING ON OUR WORK TODAY The Example of Job
[170]  If we realize that God desires to work Himself into His chosen people and if we realize that this is what we all need, then the goal of our work will be to minister Christ to others so that the Triune God may build Himself into their being.
[171]  Our work in the recovery today is to minister God to people.
[172]  But I ask you this question: How much of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God has been wrought into those whom you have brought to God?
[173]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SEED OF DAVID
[174]  The Bible reveals a wonderful, marvelous person Jesus Christ, the God-man.
[175]  A servant of the house of Saul, whose name was Ziba, was called to David, and David asked him, "Is there yet anyone at all of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?" v. 3a . The servant told him that there was still a son of Jonathan, one who was crippled in his feet.
[176]  David gave all that belonged to Saul and to all his house to Mephibosheth, making Ziba and his household servants to Mephibosheth.
[177]  C. In His Indulging of the Lust of the Eyes
[178]  You have stricken down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife as your wife and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon" v. 9 . Here God, speaking through Nathan, condemned David for murdering Uriah and for robbing him of his wife.
[179]  Nathan told David that because he had despised Jehovah the sword would not depart from his house forever v. 10 . God would raise up trouble against him from within his house.
[180]  Further, God said that He would take David's wives before his eyes and give them to his companion, who would lie with them in the sight of the sun v. 11 . David had done this secretly, but God would do it before all Israel and even before the sun v. 12 .
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR MAN'S FAILURE AND GOD'S PUNISHMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 11:1 12:23
[182]  In this message I have the burden to speak a word concerning man's failure and God's punishment.
[183]  In addition to man's failure, the books of Samuel reveal God's punishment.
[184]  God exercised a severe punishment upon David because his sin was very evil.
[185]  If we trace the history of the church, we will see that what has happened during the past nineteen centuries matches the four matters found in the books of Samuel: God's sovereignty, God's economy, man's failure, and God's punishing judgment.
[186]  In verses 5 through 14 Shimei, a man of the family of the house of Saul, came forth to King David.
[187]  Second Samuel 16:15 17:23 tells us that Absalom took Jerusalem and ruled there.
[188]  Second Samuel 17:24 19:8a describes how Absalom was defeated and killed.
[189]  in the Bringing Back of David to His Kingship 1.
[190]  The men of Israel asked David why the men of Judah had stolen him away and brought him and his household over the Jordan along with the men of David v. 41 . Israel also claimed that they had ten parts in the king and that in David they had more than Judah v. 43a .
[191]  In the remainder of his song, David thanked God whose way is perfect; whose word is tried; who is the unique God, setting him on high places; whose condescending gentleness had made him great and had broadened the places of his steps, strengthening him to subdue his enemies, keeping him as the head of the nations, and making foreigners cringe to him and serve him; and who manifested salvation to His king and executed lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and to his seed Christ forever vv.
[192]  Verses 8 through 39 speak of the mighty men of David.
[193]  God offered David three choices: seven years of famine coming upon the land, fleeing before his adversaries for three months under their pursuing, and three days of pestilence in the land v. 13 . David, in a great strait, chose to fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His compassions are great, and was not willing to fall into the hand of man v. 14 .
[194]  TO THE LIFE-STUDY OF 1 AND 2 SAMUEL
[195]  She was seeking God and spontaneously coordinated and cooperated with God.
[196]  Samuel, the issue of his mother Hannah's coordination and cooperation with God, became a faithful Nazarite according to his mother's desire for God and rendered to God the way to end the corrupted age of the judges and to bring in 1 the age of kingship to replace the governing ministry of the old priesthood and 2 the prophethood to replace the God-speaking ministry of the old priesthood.
[197]  David, being a man according to God's heart, afforded God the way to begin the age of kingship for the establishment of His kingdom on the earth for His coming Christ.
[198]  This became the factor of the loss of eleven-twelfths of his God-given kingdom, which sowed the seed of Solomon's corruption, issuing in the loss of the God-given kingdom, and the seed of the corruption of his descendants in the kingship, issuing in the loss of the holy land and the captivity of the holy people in their dispersion to the whole world up to the present age.
