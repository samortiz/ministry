   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE CHRIST HIS PERSON 19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>52.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The One Who in His Reproducing Resurrection Declared the Father s Name to His Brothers and Praised Him in the Midst of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the One who in His reproducing resurrection declared the Father s name to the brothers and praised Him in the midst of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is prophesied in Psalm 22:22: I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, by which we see that it is a prophecy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brothers mentioned in Psalm 22:22 are Christ s many brothers brought forth through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, this verse prophesies that in resurrection Christ would declare the Father s name, the Father s person, to the Lord s brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was born to be God s firstborn Son and that God s chosen people were born with Him to be the many sons of God, Christ s many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Christ s resurrection was a corporate birth, the birth of the firstborn Son and His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Hebrews 2:12, the firstborn Son of God declared in the church the Father s name to His brothers: I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the Father is the source of life and nature, to declare the name of the Father is to show the many brothers the source of life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God, they did not know the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They knew God as the Creator but not as the Father who begets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They knew God s creating power, but they did not know the Father s begetting life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before Christ s resurrection, not even His disciples knew the Father s life and begetting ability.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, on the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father in order to make them know the Father as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to John 20, the Lord Jesus visited His disciples in the evening on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But John does not say that He declared the Father to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is mentioned prophetically in Psalm 22:22.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to this prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came to His disciples to make the Father known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father s life and nature had become theirs, and His very being had been imparted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what it means to declare the Father s name to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This declaration was not simply a matter of mentioning the name; rather, it was an impartation of all that the Father is His life, nature, and being into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was from such a declaration that Peter came to realize that he was a partaker of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We, the sons of God, have all become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To us, God is no longer merely the creating God; He is also the begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has imparted His life, His nature, and even His being into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what it means for the resurrected Christ to declare the Father s name to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Psalm 22:22 prophesies not only that Christ will declare the Father s name but also that He will praise the Father in the midst of the congregation: In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fulfillment of this prophecy, the second part of Hebrews 2:12 says, In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Literally the Greek words rendered I will sing hymns of praise unto You mean I will hymn You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here we have the firstborn Son s praising of the Father from within the Father s many sons in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praises.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone, but rather within us and with us through our praising.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He sings hymns of praise to the Father in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Psalm 22:22 and Hebrews 2:12 we see that after declaring the Father s name, the Son sings hymns of praise to Him in the midst of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout the centuries the firstborn Son has been singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does this in all of His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because He is in us, He sings praises unto the Father in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His singing is in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we sing, He sings because He is within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we sing hymns to the Father from our spirit, Christ sings with us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the meetings of the church the firstborn Son, who dwells in His many brothers who compose the church, sings praise to the Father from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we, Christ s brothers, sing praise to the Father, the more the Lord sings in our singing.</S>
