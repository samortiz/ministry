   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Nourishing and Caring for the New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second step is the feeding, the nourishing, of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is much harder than gaining the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To bring forth a child is hard but not as hard as raising a child.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day and night the mother and father would sacrifice everything for that child.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, among the Christians, very few would do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we brought someone to the Lord, but after two months they died prematurely because they received no care.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament is full of this matter of feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the following messages, we will see how Paul did the nourishing, the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul says that he cared for the believers as a nursing mother would cherish her own children and that he entreated and consoled them as a father his own children 1 Thes 2:7, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must learn to feed, to nourish, the new ones whom we have brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are just like newborn babes that need the feeding, the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus talked to Peter about the feeding of the small lambs 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most students and teachers of this Gospel concentrate their teaching and fellowship directly on the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, after John seemed to conclude his Gospel in chapter twenty, he added one more chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this additional chapter, the Lord checked with Peter: "Peter, do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you say you love Me, you have to do one thing feed My lambs."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the mothers know that to feed or to nourish a little child is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we look at the situation today, among the believers who are not pastors and preachers, who is doing this kind of feeding work?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot feed the lambs occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to do it regularly, just like nourishing a little baby.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to do it, not only daily, but many times a day and at certain times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the babe will be nourished; otherwise, it may die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even among ourselves today, we cannot see much feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we are not serving the Lord according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you believe that the word of the Lord, "Feed My lambs," is spoken only to Peter but not to you?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter stood there before the Lord representing all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever the Lord spoke to him is the same to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we must learn and endeavor to get into the practice of feeding the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of who we are, as long as we are a believer, we are charged by the Lord to feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day, we will all stand before the Lord at His judgment seat to give account of ourselves in this matter Rom 14:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perfecting the Believers and Prophesying for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third step, after the matter of feeding, is the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is nearly no perfecting work being done on the believers today according to the truth of Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The last main step is to prophesy for the church, the Body of Christ, to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Generally speaking, this practice does not exist today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By all that we have talked about above, we can see that both Christianity and we ourselves are not practicing these four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way we are taking to preach the gospel is not so scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The feeding of the lambs is nearly absent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The perfecting of the saints has been neglected nearly no one has been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as the prophesying for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ, as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most of the Christians are building up a congregation for a facade, a show.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where is the organic building of the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This organic building could only be done by all the saints endeavoring to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But today, there is not such a thing.</S>
