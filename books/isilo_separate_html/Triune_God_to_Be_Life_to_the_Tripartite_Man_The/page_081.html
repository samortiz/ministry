The Greek word rendered fellowship in 1 John 1:3 is koinonia, which means joint participation or common participation. According to this verse, the divine fellowship is not only with the Father but also with the Son. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 this divine fellowship is called "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit," in Acts 2:42 it is "the fellowship of the apostles," and in Philippians 2:1 it is the "fellowship of spirit." From these portions of the Word, we can see that the divine fellowship belongs to the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the apostles, and all of the believers. They are all involved in this fellowship. This divine fellowship involves many persons; hence, it is mutual. It is impossible for just one person by himself to have this fellowship. The fellowship is one, but it involves many persons.</P><P>One of the best illustrations of fellowship is electricity. Electricity is mysterious yet very real. Electricity is manifested in light bulbs or fluorescent lamps when the current of electricity flows through them. If the bulbs or lamps remain intact and the current of electricity flows, the electricity appears. But if the bulbs or lamps are broken, the electricity disappears. The bulbs and lamps are connected by the current of electricity. In a community or city, all of the homes are joined together by the current of electricity which flows into each of the homes. This current of electricity is an example of fellowship. The fellowship is the flow of the eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life. By the flow of electricity, all of the homes are kept in oneness. Similarly, by the flow of the eternal life, the fellowship, all of the believers are kept in oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP AND ITS TWO ASPECTS</H2><P>First John 1:2-3 and 6-7 reveal that the fellowship of the divine life has both a vertical aspect and a horizontal aspect. The vertical aspect of fellowship refers to our fellowship with the Triune God. The horizontal aspect of fellowship refers to our fellowship with one another.</P><P>First John 1:2-3 says, " And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us. That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ." The vertical aspect of fellowship was initially established with the first apostles. The apostles then reported to sinners the eternal life in order that they might have fellowship with the apostles. Before the apostles reported the eternal life to them, the apostles themselves already had the vertical fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (v. 3). The initial experience of the apostles was vertical, but when the apostles reported the eternal life to others, they experienced the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship.</P><P>Verses 6 and 7 of 1 John 1 also indicate the vertical and horizontal aspects of the divine fellowship. Verse 6 says, "If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth." This is the vertical aspect of fellowship. Verse 7 says, "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another." This is the horizontal aspect of fellowship. Both aspects of the divine fellowship are closely related; therefore, it is difficult to say which aspect comes first. If you do not have the proper fellowship with the Lord, it is difficult to have fellowship with your fellow believers. In the same way, if you do not have the proper fellowship with your fellow believers, it is difficult to have fellowship with the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> </body></html>
