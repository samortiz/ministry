THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>We may wonder when the Roman Catholic Church began. If we trace its roots, it is evident that it began with Clement. In the second century he brought the Jewish priestly system into the church; this system of priests was like a seed sown in the church. This seed of corruption and error operated within the church until approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage. Cyprian promoted a hierarchy dividing the bishops from the other clergy beneath them. This hierarchical organization was formed into a unified church called the catholic church. This catholic church was not yet the Roman Catholic Church. When the government of the Roman Empire was mixed with the catholic church, the catholic church began to look more like the Roman Catholic Church. The formal beginning of the Roman Catholic Church dates from when the highest bishop was designated as the pope. At that juncture the church had a pope and archbishops; under the archbishops were the bishops, and under the bishops were the priests. Each locality had priests, several localities were combined into a district under a bishop, and several districts were combined into a large district under an archbishop.</p>
<p>After politics and religion were united, the Roman Empire was divided into five large religious regions. Each region had a patriarch; thus, there were a total of five patriarchs. Each religious region had a central city, and each central city had a patriarch. The patriarchs were situated in Rome (Europe), Alexandria (North Africa), Constantinople (Near East), Antioch (Asia Minor), and Jerusalem (Palestine). These five regions surrounded the Mediterranean Sea and covered all the areas under the jurisdiction of the Roman Empire. The five patriarchs tacitly acknowledged that the patriarch of Rome had the highest rank, but they did not have authority to govern one another. Although there was not yet a pope, there were power struggles among the patriarchs.</p>
<p>In A.D. 590 Gregory I, also known as Gregory the Great, became patriarch of Rome. Gregory was talented and a good politician, and his heart was to elevate the position of Rome. Thus, he required the other patriarchs to acknowledge his supreme authority. He advocated that Rome should be above all other places because Peter had gone to Rome. Peter was the successor of Christ; therefore, the patriarch of Rome was the successor of Peter. People began to call Gregory &ldquo;Pope,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Father&rdquo; or &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; The Chinese translation of the word <em>pope</em> is <em>jiao huang,</em> meaning &ldquo;religious emperor.&rdquo; This is how the office of the pope came into being. The five religious regions split over this issue, with the four in the East standing against Rome in the West. Although the four eastern regions did not submit to Rome, Rome still wielded power because it was the capital of the Roman Empire. However, the patriarch of Constantinople never submitted to Rome, and in the eleventh century it separated to form the Eastern Roman Church, or the Eastern Greek Church. The Eastern Roman Church later became the Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church was fully formed by the end of the sixth century. The popes who succeeded Gregory the Great set in place the Roman organization, system, practices, and authority. As far as the church is concerned, they were corrupt to the uttermost. The corrupt things&mdash;such as heresies, customs of the nations, and worldly power&mdash;were much worse under the popes than they had been when the church was first joined to the world. In the early stages of the union of the church and the world, worldly customs entered the church in an informal way, not an official way. After the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the popes officially recognized many worldly traditions, which they decreed that all the churches in the world had to obey. Thus, the traditions were authorized. After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its official religion, many Roman customs were brought into the Roman church. For example, Roman feast days were brought into the church, and unregenerated Romans became members of the church. The early Roman church took unsaved people, who enjoyed celebrating pagan festivities, sprinkled them with water, and made them members of the church. Similarly, the Chinese like to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-autumn Moon Festival. Since they are accustomed to celebrating these festivals, when the time comes for the Mid-autumn Moon Festival, they eat moon cakes.</p>
<p>Even though I grew up in a somewhat Christian household, we would still write a Chinese couplet and New Year&rsquo;s greetings on sheets of red paper and paste them on our door every Chinese New Year. Some people were so accustomed to celebrating Chinese New Year that it was difficult to tell whether they were saved, because every Chinese New Year they would hang couplets on their doors. I clearly remember one set of couplets, which said, &ldquo;Glory in heaven to God; / Peace on earth to men.&rdquo; They were celebrating a worldly festival, but their couplets were written with words from the Bible.</p>
<p>After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its official religion and the church was united with politics, the citizens of the Roman Empire brought their customs into the church. The goddess Artemis, whom they worshipped, became the &ldquo;holy mother&rdquo; Mary; Artemis is the Greek name for Diana in the Roman myths. The festival day for the worship of the sun was called the birthday of Christ and became Christmas. These customs had come into the church prior to the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, but people did not pay much attention to them. However, once the office of the pope was introduced, the popes officially recognized these customs and ordered the whole church to follow them. Thus, goddess worship became an officially recognized matter. The legend of Mary&rsquo;s ascent into heaven was merely a legend in the catholic church, but once the pope officially recognized it, it had an official standing. A Catholic today who says that Mary did not ascend into heaven is a rebellious person, because the pope has officially proclaimed that Mary was taken up into heaven.</p>
<p>In 1854 Pope Pius IX issued a papal bull proclaiming that Mary was without sin; this is the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. According to this teaching, when Mary conceived of the Holy Spirit, she escaped from original sin. After the pope made this declaration, all Roman Catholics had to agree that Mary was without sin. Once Pius IX officially recognized this doctrine, it was legally binding. The popes also officially confirmed the worship of the apostle Paul. Every one of the so-called Catholic saints has been canonized by the pope. For example, the pope canonized St. Francis of Assisi. All the members of the Catholic Church must keep whatever the popes officially proclaim, even if it is sinful. Whoever does not keep these things is considered to be in rebellion. What a corrupt situation!</p>
<p>A man named Alexander Hislop spent much time to study the mystery of Babylon the Great, and he put the results of his research into a thick book called <em>The Two Babylons.</em> Hislop&rsquo;s book exposes the hidden, dark, and corrupt things of Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is truly a mystery with many things hidden inside. We do not need to examine the entire history of the Roman Catholic Church to see that it has no life or light and is in darkness and corruption&mdash;we can simply look at the Roman Catholic Church in Manila.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, I thought it was very strange that the Catholics would carry a statue of Mary in a parade, with two lines of people following behind holding candles. They would dress up a young girl as a queen, and she would march in the middle of these lines. There also would be a group of young men among them as kings; they also would march in lines in the parade. How can this be worship to God? It is hard to believe that the church has been transmuted to such an extent that it has no life at all and is entirely wicked. I do not want to say too much, and I hope we would not have a critical attitude, but this situation should break our heart.</p>
<p>When I was in Manila, on the night of a feast re-enacting the so-called Passion, someone would dress up as a suffering Jesus. Some people would beat him with whips while others around him would weep. Many of these people were habitual criminals; some were members of gangs who cheated people and extorted their money, and others were pickpockets and thieves. These criminals would also come out to weep and shout. Moreover, I learned that some Filipinos were wealthy, but their consciences were convicted because their money came from illegal sources. As they were dying, they would beg their children to use some of their money to buy masses for them in order to atone for their sins. This is not slander; these things are factual.</p>
<p>The church has been completely transmuted. It is altogether different in its organization and administration than it was in the beginning. Spiritually speaking, it is no longer the church, because the heavenly, spiritual nature of Christ is completely gone. In the Roman Catholic Church we may not be able to find even one saved person among a hundred of its members. It is difficult to adequately describe the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church as recorded in Revelation 17:5: &ldquo;MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church is truly a great harlot on the earth.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to criticize the mistakes of others. Our goal is to see the course of the church on the earth. I hope that God would open our eyes to see the things that should be in the church and the things that are filthy and corrupt, to see the things that were originally in the church and the things which were not originally in the church. We must humble ourselves before the Lord, receive mercy, follow Him in a lowly manner, and walk in the way that He has ordained for His church in this age.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
