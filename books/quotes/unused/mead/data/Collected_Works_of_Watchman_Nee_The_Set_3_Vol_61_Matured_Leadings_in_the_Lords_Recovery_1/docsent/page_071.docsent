   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HANDING ONESELF OVER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN AN ABSOLUTE WAY Date: Saturday evening, February 11, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong CONSECRATION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LORD'S GRACE AND OUR JOY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants us to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a joy this is to us!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul told the Corinthians that the Lord died in order that we who live would no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died and was raised for us 2 Cor 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord died and resurrected for us but did not give us a chance to live for Him, it would indeed be a suffering and a pain to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once I was moving my home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was the only person doing the work and could not move the heavy furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Two brothers came to my rescue and helped me move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they were finished, they were all covered with dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I asked whether they were hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They said no and returned home immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That night I did not sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I thought of the two brothers who helped me move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were covered with sweat and dirt and returned home late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet I did not repay them anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I felt bad, and the whole night I could not rest my head or sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has accomplished a great redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His work is many times greater than moving a house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we asked the Lord, "What do You want me to do?", He could answer, "Everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You do not have to do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If He said this, we would feel terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I often have felt that it is a great grace of the Lord that we are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also a great grace to be allowed to consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man receives the matchless grace of the Lord's redemption yet has no intention of living for Him, either he is not saved at all or he must not have a clear idea about his salvation and the greatness of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a Christian does not serve the Lord, he will feel that he owes the Lord something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will feel queasy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though the Lord has everything and even though the cattle and sheep on a thousand hills are His, He wants our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man is created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All men belong to Him, but He wants our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We often think that if God commissioned the angels to preach the gospel, they would probably do a better job than us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their emotions are not finicky as ours are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We preach according to our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The angels could preach eight hours a day without being affected by their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They would also preach better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our preaching is flawed, but the angels would not have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet if the angels were given the responsibility of preaching the gospel, they could only preach about a sinless Savior; they could only preach a sinless salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we can speak as sinners saved by the Lord from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our preaching is so much richer than the preaching of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the same reason God also sees our consecration as being so much richer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all love money, but if we see how much the Lord has done for us, we will gladly offer up everything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope all the brothers and sisters will see that it is a great grace to be allowed to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is also our greatest joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope all the brothers and sisters will strive to enter into this supreme peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our consecration falls short of giving our all and if our standard is anything less than absolute, we will know the difference; the difference will be great, and the gap will be wide.</S>
