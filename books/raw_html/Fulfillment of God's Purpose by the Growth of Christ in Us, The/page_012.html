<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Thorny Ground</H2><P>The third category is the thorny ground (v. 7). The thorns choke the growth of life. The Lord Jesus told us that the thorns signify three things: the anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things (v. 19). People today are caught up with this age. They are never satisfied with what they have. If they have an older car, they want a newer one. If they live in a house, they want a better house. These are the cares of the age. To a seeker of Christ, a seeking one in the church life, it makes no difference what kind of car or dwelling he has. All the cares of the age choke the growth.</P><P>Many of the young Chinese who come to this country are so ambitious to get a doctor's degree. The young people surely have to study, but they should not study so ambitiously to the extent that they make education their goal and not the Lord. Even with those of us who have a job, we should try to work eight hours a day and five days a week, leaving the rest of our time for the church life. We should do a good job, but we should not care for overtime or for promotions. We would never be cheated by the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>If you sell yourself to your job to get a promotion, your job becomes Pharaoh to you. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, makes the people of God very busy so that they do not have time for God's interests. A brother may get a doctor's degree or receive a good promotion, but this may cause him to be too busy to practice the church life. He may have to work day and night to sell himself for his job, for his promotion. Then how can he grow in life? This is the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>Do we really need that much money? We need to simplify our life. Do not be a slave to make money or a slave to spend money. You have to spend much of your energy to make money and then more time to spend the money. If you make less money, you will save your time in spending money. The ones who spend much time to make money are enslaved. They spend more energy in spending money, and then they spend more time in using the things they buy. They have time for everything but no time for the Lord. This is the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>We need to be simple in making money, in using money, and in using things that are bought by money. If we do not make that much money, we do not need to spend that much money, and we do not need more time to use the things we buy with the money. So we are so simple in the world. We are so free, liberated, and simplified for the Lord. We have plenty of time for the Lord and for the church life.</P><P>We should just spend enough time on our job to make a living. All the rest of our hours should be for the Lord and for the church life. In this way, it is so easy for the life within us to grow because nothing is choking it. We also have to beware of the lusts, or the desires, for other things. Maybe your goal and desire are to have a doctor's degree. That could be a lust which can choke the life within you.</P>
