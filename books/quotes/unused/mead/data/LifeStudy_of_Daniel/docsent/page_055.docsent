   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS IN THE BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF DANIEL GOD'S HEAVENLY RULE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PREEMINENCE OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE PORTION OF GOD'S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Daniel covers three crucial matters: God's heavenly rule, the preeminence of Christ, and the portion of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His economy God administrates the universe in order to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His purpose is to give Christ the preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's intention, therefore, is that Christ should be preeminent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For Christ to be the preeminent One, God needs a people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from God's having a people, there is no way for Christ to be made preeminent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As those who have been chosen by God to be His people for Christ's preeminence, we are under God's heavenly rule.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning this, the principle is the same both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Under God's heavenly rule, everything is working together for our good Rom 8:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is especially true of the things in our personal universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our universe includes ourselves, our families, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our universe many things happen day by day for the purpose of making Christ preeminent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to realize this and be submissive to God's heavenly rule.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 4:26 Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar, "Your kingdom will be assured to you after you have come to know that the heavens do rule."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the heavens that rule, not Nebuchadnezzar or Cyrus or Alexander the Great or illness or turmoil or rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The earth is under the rule of a heavenly administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heavens rule for us, and Christ is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, we are under God's heavenly rule for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of the heavenly ruling is to complete God's elect so that Christ may be preeminent, that He may be the first the centrality and everything the universality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the heavens rule, Christ is with us in all our situations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are sick, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are in turmoil, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can testify that we can enjoy His presence in the midst of turmoil and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to learn three things: that this universe is under God's administration; that God's intention in His administration is to make Christ preeminent, to cause Him to have the first place in everything; and that for the accomplishment of God's intention, we, His people, His elect, must give Him the best coordination and cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through our coordination and cooperation, God will consummate His eternal intention to make Christ preeminent through the rule of the heavens.</S>
