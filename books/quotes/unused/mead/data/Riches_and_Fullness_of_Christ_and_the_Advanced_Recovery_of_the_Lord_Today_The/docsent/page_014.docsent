   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Until All the Saints Arrive at a Full-grown Man, at the Full Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those brothers and sisters who have come from various localities should know that the growth of the church where they are depends on their growth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not they grow depends on whether or not they have Christ growing in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you give Christ the ground, He will grow in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way, you will grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you grow, the church in your place will also grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the gradual growth of the organic Body of Christ in you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, you have to allow Christ to grow in you, and you have to grow in Him, so that the church can grow in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the growth of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE GROWTH OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST BEING THE ORGANIC BUILDING OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the growth of the Body is the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In simple terms, the growth is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The growth of the church is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While you are growing, you are being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you would not grow, but would stay in the old way, this would be a tearing down for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a church, as long as some of the brothers and sisters would grow, the church in that locality would be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, growth is the key to building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we all grow, the growth becomes the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the Resurrected and Ascended Head Producing the Gifted Persons through His Resurrection Life to Be the Gifts Given to the Church Produced by Him as His Body</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His resurrection life, He made the saved sinners the gifts, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, and He gave them to the church for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These Gifts Given by Christ to the Church Perfecting the Saints for the Work of the Unique New Testament Ministry, Which Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ The Saints Perfected by the Gifts Building the Body of Christ Directly through the Organic Function of the Measure of Each One Part</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus said that He would build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After He spoke this word, He did not build up the church directly by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He gave a group of gifted persons perfected by Him, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These gifted ones do not build up the church directly either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, they first perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The perfected saints then do the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible shows us that every saint is a priest and should fulfill his priestly duty, which is to directly build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those gifted ones should perfect the ones who do not have the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When those without the gifts are perfected, together they can do the same work that the gifted ones can do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, in the church everyone can do the work of the New Testament ministry, and everyone can directly build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Gifted Ones Being the Joints of the Life Supply in the Organic Body of Christ, the Other Members Being the Different Parts in This Organic Body; the Two Coordinating to Build Up the Body of Christ Organically Through the Joints of the Life Supply, and through the Different Parts That Operate in Their Measures, the Body Being Made to Grow unto the Building Up of Itself</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 4:16 says, "Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are two kinds of members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The joints of supply are one kind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This refers particularly to the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The other kind is the "each one part.''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This refers to every member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every member in the Body of Christ has its measure through the growth in life and the development of its gift, and every member can function for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Body of Christ grows by itself through the supplying joints and the functioning parts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The growth of the Body of Christ is a matter of the increase of Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The result is that the Body of Christ is built up by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps you are not a supplying joint in the church, but nevertheless you are a part of the Body, and you should function according to your organic capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christianity way of worship services has killed the organic function of the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, we can no longer take the old way of one speaking and all the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need all the brothers and sisters to rise up to be the joints of supply and to function as the other parts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we function, the more we will be exercised, and the more we are exercised, the more we will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, the Body will grow and will be built up directly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank the Lord and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are the supplying joints, and there are the functioning parts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the two are joined and linked together, the Body will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This growth will issue in the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 24, 1989</S>
