 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CONDITION OF MAN&mdash;<br />
THE NEED OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the condition of man. Man&rsquo;s condition shows that he needs salvation. Hence, we must use the Bible to show man his condition so that he may realize his need for God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>There are at least three aspects of the condition of fallen man prior to salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S CONDITION BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All have sinned&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:23, see also vv. 10-12; 5:12).</p>
<p>The first aspect of man&rsquo;s condition before God is that he has sinned and is sinful. Man&rsquo;s sinfulness before God is twofold; it is both positional and experiential. Although a man may not have committed a sin, he is positionally sinful before God because he is a descendant of Adam. Adam was appointed by God to be the head of the human race, and as such, he represents the entire human race. When Adam sinned as head and representative of the human race, all the men represented by him also sinned. When the first man Adam sinned, all of his descendants were placed in a sinful position before God.</p>
<p>Since Adam is the father of the human race, all men are born of him. When Adam sinned, he not only represented all mankind but also included the entire human race. Adam&rsquo;s descendants were in him, even though none of them were born yet. When Adam sinned, his descendants sinned with him and in him. Adam&rsquo;s act of sin caused his descendants to sin in him. Man is sinful at birth; there is no need for him to sin, for he is sinful already.</p>
<p>Positionally, man is sinful before God. Experientially, man is also sinful before God. No one can say that he has never sinned or that he has clean hands, an undefiled heart, and no experience of sin. Everyone has experienced lying, stealing, filthy thoughts, or improper behavior. Man&rsquo;s position of sin produces his experience of sin. Man&rsquo;s experience of sin proves his position of sin. Both positionally and experientially, man is sinful.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Fall under the judgment of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Condemned already&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:19; John 3:18; see also Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>Because man has sinned, he is under the judgment of God. God is righteous, and He is the One who establishes the law. According to His righteousness and His law, He must judge sinful man. God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s law place man under God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>Man is under not only God&rsquo;s judgment but also His condemnation. Whether or not he is aware of it, man has been judged and is condemned before God. There is no need to wait for God&rsquo;s judgment in the future; man has already received the verdict that he is guilty of sin and is condemned before God. When God condemned Adam because of his sin, God also condemned the entire human race in Adam through his one offense. Today every human being is born a condemned sinner.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The wrath of God abides upon him&rdquo;; &ldquo;Children of wrath&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:36; Eph. 2:3).</p>
<p>Because men have sinned and transgressed against God&rsquo;s righteousness, they not only are condemned under God&rsquo;s judgment, but as children of wrath under God&rsquo;s wrath, men daily evoke His wrath. God&rsquo;s wrath is like thunder; it is ready to explode upon mankind. God withholds His wrath in order to give men the opportunity to repent and be saved. God&rsquo;s wrath will surely break forth on those who do not repent.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:27).</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s law, those who sin must die. Man sinned; therefore, his portion according to God&rsquo;s law (the portion reserved for man) is death. Death is set before the unrepentant sinner. If he refuses to repent, he will receive only death under God&rsquo;s wrath. When death comes to a man, God&rsquo;s wrath explodes upon him.</p>
<p>Death is not the end. After a man dies, he still faces judgment. Although he is already condemned, he will still face another judgment. In this future judgment, the condemnation under which God has placed man will be executed. Although God condemns man&rsquo;s sin according to His righteousness, He has not yet executed this condemnation because of His love. God desires man to repent; therefore, He waits and gives man opportunity to repent. If a man refuses to repent to the very end, he will enter into death and face God&rsquo;s final judgment. In His judgment God will execute the sentence that He has pronounced upon man.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Perish&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16; Rev. 20:15; see also 21:8).</p>
<p>After an unrepentant man passes through God&rsquo;s final judgment, he will perish; that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer eternally. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Mark 9:48, in the lake of fire &ldquo;their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.&rdquo; How painful and terrible to be eaten by worms and burned by fire!</p>
<p>This is man&rsquo;s condition before God.</p>
