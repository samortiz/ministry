The Lord's recovery is testifying that regardless of differing races, cultures, or levels of education, all Christians should be one
In the past sixty years, the Lord has used us to put out many publications concerning Christ, the church, and the Body of Christ in oneness
The clergy are the professional preachers, pastors, and ministers, who serve God in place of the other members of the church
In a big family, all the members, including the parents, grandparents, and children, must do something for the family
Every member of the Body, regardless of how long he has been saved and how many talents he has received, must serve
In most Christian meetings on the Lord's Day, there is a congregation with one or two speaking while the rest listen
After many years of meeting in this way, the functioning capacity and gifts of the members are spontaneously annulled
After six years of study, practice, and experimenting, the Lord has given us a clear view concerning the universal service
If we mean business with the Lord in His God-ordained way, we must bear the burden to preach the gospel to get sinners saved
After the new believers have believed and have been baptized, we must consider them as our babies and ourselves as their begetting parents
In the same way, we must do our best to raise up the new believers by teaching, instructing, and correcting them through the group meetings
Finally, every believer should prophesy in the church meetings for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ
Everyone must be trained to prophesy, which is to speak the Lord, speak for the Lord, and speak the Lord forth into others
We have depended on the Lord's Day morning meetings and the conference and training meetings to raise up and perfect the saints
Although many of the saints have been listening to the messages of the ministry for many years, they have not borne fruit
If only thirty go out and each one bears one fruit yearly, the church will have a thirty percent increase yearly
To remain in the Lord's recovery indicates that we love the Lord, but if we love the Lord, we must mean business with Him
We must reconsider our situation and even make a vow to the Lord to give Him three hours a week to reach some sinners
We simply can make an appointment with our friends, relatives, neighbors, and colleagues and visit them with some other brothers or sisters
When we have two or three new ones, we can stop visiting sinners for a while and spend all our time feeding the new ones
It may be that after meeting in the Lord's recovery for several years, we still do not know each other's situation
The group meetings should also have mutual questions and mutual answers to carry out the mutual teaching for the perfecting of one another
In the past the elders may have divided the saints into group meetings and assigned a leader to be the teacher in each group meeting
We have many publications covering many subjects, such as justification by faith, baptism, reconciliation, and forgiveness of sins
After meeting in this way, all the newly perfected ones will be able to speak for the Lord in the church meetings
The prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is defined in verse 3 But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation
The prophesying that builds up the Body of Christ is either to build others up or to render encouragement or consolation
Learning is needed for our prophesying , but to predict miraculously or to speak in tongues does not require learning
The learned pastors, preachers, and ministers who have studied in seminaries have become the professional speakers
