   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE LIFE THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the critical point of the Christian faith; it is the peak of the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to see how Christ can be our life in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order that we may know and contact Him, God was incarnated to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this man we come to realize what God is like.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This man was none other than Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was God clothed with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Physically speaking, the body of Jesus was no different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the life within Him was absolutely of another category.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His life was purely the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It had the characteristics of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God bestows to those who are in Christ the very same life that was embodied in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>DEATH RELEASED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when Jesus was walking on the earth, the life that He possessed could not be imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His life was bound by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was confined to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It could not enter into the believers to be their new source of existence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Christ had to die in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He died, the bondage of the flesh was shattered and His life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 12:24 the Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is life embodied in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the grain falls into the ground and dies, the life within is released, and much fruit is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, God did not stop at incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He went through death in order that His life would be freed from the flesh and released into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is no longer limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His life can now be dispensed unreservedly to all who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The death of Christ on the cross was not merely for redemption of sin but also for the release of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The latter is the primary goal, while the former is only a remedial necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DEATH ALSO SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, before we could receive this life, God also had to solve our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the death of Christ had the aspect of redemption with it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now God has a just ground upon which He can dispense life to us, and we also have a proper standing to receive boldly this new life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a passage in the Bible with which we are quite familiar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I wish to point out two things in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, it does not say that God loves sinners; it says that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The world denotes humanity in general and has a higher sense than sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not mean to say that God does not love sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the purpose of God in this verse the bestowing of eternal life is not granted to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sinners are at a lower level than God's basic requirement for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a basic standard upon which God can freely dispense life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But a sinner is below that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, before anything could be realized, God had to forgive and deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The death of Christ paid the ransom for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we need no longer be sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>SUMMIT OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But receiving the forgiveness of sins merely recovers us back to the state before Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was just a man, and his life was merely a human life at the proper level.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But God intends to give His only begotten Son to us so that we may receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the summit of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is not only recovering what we lost in Adam; He is bestowing what Adam never received.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Adam did not eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Had he not sinned at all, he would still be merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He had no relationship with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we have inherited something far more excellent in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition to a human life, we have a new life, a life from God, which is the very Son of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the meaning of eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It simply means a life of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man's life is transient; it will not survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the life of the Son of God can exist there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If I put my own life in eternity, it would shrivel up immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It would not last!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It would perish as a fish in air or a bird in water.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man's life can only carry him through a temporary existence on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It will not make it through eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only an eternal life can survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First John 5:11-12 says, "And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here we are told that this life of eternity is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is found in no other place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whoever does not have this life in the Son is merely a human; he can only exist on earth, but not survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He does not have that life which qualifies him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After the Son of God passed through death and resurrection and became the Holy Spirit, He is no longer limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can now receive Him anytime and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hitherto, whoever received the Son of God received God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same way, whoever receives the Holy Spirit receives the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This enables all those who have received Christ to obtain a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Not only are their sins forgiven, but they inherit an eternal life from God as well.</S>
