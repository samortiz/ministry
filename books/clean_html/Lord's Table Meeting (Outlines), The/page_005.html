<ol class="upper-roman" start="5"><li>There are two minor aspects of the Lord's table meeting:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To display the Lord's death&#151;1 Cor. 11:26.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>First Corinthians 11:26 says, "You declare [show, display, proclaim, announce] the Lord's death."</li>		<li>The Lord's supper is to display the death of the Lord, rather than to remember it.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>We remember the person of the Lord, but we announce, proclaim, His death.</li>			<li>We declare His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>While we remember the Lord, the two elements, the bread (body) and cup (blood), are displayed separately on the table.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>This shows that the blood is separated from the body, signifying death.</li>			<li>With this display of death we proclaim and announce Christ's all-inclusive termination of twelve items on the cross&#151;the angelic life (Col. 1:20), the human life (Gal. 2:20), Satan (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31), the kingdom of Satan (Col. 2:15; John 12:31), sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3), sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6), the world (Gal. 6:14; John 12:31), death (Heb. 2:14), flesh (Gal. 5:24), the old man (Rom. 6:6), self (Gal. 2:20), and all things, or creation (Col. 1:20).</li>			</ol></li>		<li>By the death of the Lord all negative things have come to an end, and their end is displayed openly; this is the negative aspect.</li>		<li>The table also shows we can receive the Lord, symbolized by the bread and wine, into ourselves; this is the positive aspect.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>On the one hand, the old creation is ended, but on the other hand, His new creation has begun.</li>			<li>Now He mingles Himself with us and we live by Him.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>To express our hope&#151;1 Cor. 11:26.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>According to 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are to declare the Lord's death "until He comes."</li>		<li>We take the Lord's supper for the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back.</li>		<li>We are declaring a glorious matter, but we also have a glorious hope.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In a sense we are satisfied, but there is still a hope within us&#151;Col. 1:27.</li>			<li>One day He will return and change our body (1 Cor. 15:51-54); we are waiting for this.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) Our body will be transfigured at His coming&#151;Phil. 3:21.</li>				<li>2) Our redemption will be complete&#151;Rom. 8:23.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The words "until He comes" point to the coming kingdom&#151;Matt. 26:29.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In Matthew 26:29 the Lord told us that He would not drink of the fruit of the vine until He drinks it new with us in the kingdom of His Father.</li>			<li>The coming kingdom is a matter of God's universal administration.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>These two minor aspects of the Lord's supper point to the two comings of Christ.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In His first coming we have His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption&#151;the goal of His first coming.</li>		<li>His second coming will be after His having received the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-27), at which time He will establish this kingdom to be God's universal administration&#151;the goal of His second coming.</li>		<li>The death of Christ in His first coming produced the church, and the church will bring in the kingdom with His second coming; to declare the Lord's death until He comes is equal to declaring the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The church connects the Lord's death with His coming back; the church is a highway from one side to the other.</li>			<li>The church continues the Lord's death and brings in His coming back.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
