   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD'S COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 1:17-20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead; and He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear; I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever the Lord appears to someone, He has a commission for them, and His appearance here was no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Revelation 1:17a</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because John saw the glory of Christ, he was as a dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was not only true of John, but Isaiah Isa 6:1-5 , Job Job 42:5-6 , and Daniel Dan 10:8-9 , all reacted in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only was John saved, but he was very intimate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet when he saw the Lord's glory, even he fell as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If an unsaved person or a saved yet fleshly person were to see the Lord, I really do not know what would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the Bible says that fleshly persons cannot inherit the kingdom of God Gal 5:19-21 nor can the unregenerated see the kingdom of God John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very meaningful!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A filthy, fleshly person is truly unworthy to see the glorious Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Christ comes again, His glory will be even greater than it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No wonder men will be so frightened that they will lose heart and cry out to the mountains to cover them Rev 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Revelation 1:17b</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, how loving this is!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He is in glory, His love has not diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the glory in the future is not mingled with love, it is hard to see how that glory will be of any great benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He was on the earth, He laid His hands on many sick ones, and with His words He comforted many brokenhearted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is still doing the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His hand and His word not only comforted John, but they also strengthened him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This meaning can be realized by referring to Daniel 8:17-18 and 10:9-10, 18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The hand was to strengthen him, and the word was to cause him to realize the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When John realized that the Lord's love was the same as before, spontaneously, the fear was removed and strength was brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. Revelation 1:17c-18</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that the Lord used two ways to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, He revealed Himself through His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John recognized this immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, He revealed Himself through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was something inward which John could not see with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord had to use words to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From this passage we can see that the Lord revealed Himself in three aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1 In His position: "I am the First and the Last."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the Old Testament way of addressing Jehovah Isa 41:4; 44:6; 48:12 , indicating that He is the eternally unchanging God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 In His life: "And the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that He has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although He died for man's sins, He is now resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, He will never die again since He is living forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 In His authority: "And I have the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to look at this point in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Death" concerns the body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Hades" concerns the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a man dies, his soul enters Hades, which means the world below, that is, the center of the globe Matt 12:40; Num 16:30-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hades is divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One is the place of suffering, where the unbelievers go; the other is the place of rest, where the saved ones go Luke 16:19-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this is only temporary; the eternal separation is between the new heaven and the new earth on one side and the lake of fire on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Keys" are for opening doors.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows that both death and Hades have doors which may be locked Matt 16:19; Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whoever holds these keys in his hand has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This authority over death and Hades was originally in the hand of Satan Heb 2:14 , but ever since the Lord was resurrected from the dead, death and Hades have lost their power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moreover, the keys of death and of Hades have been put into the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Oh, what a victory this is!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because of this, at the coming of the millennial kingdom, the Lord will be able to release those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>D. Revelation 1:19</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word "therefore" shows that this continues the foregoing passage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord has won the victory; therefore, we should write it down.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This verse lays the sections of this book clearly before us: 1 "the things which you have seen" past , 2 "the things which are" present , and 3 "the things which are about to take place after these things" future .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word for "have seen" in the original language is in the perfect tense, which means that John had already seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This refers to the vision which John saw in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"The things which are" refer to the things which are now occurring, that is, the things happening in the church age as recorded in chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"The things which are about to take place after these things" are those things that will continue after the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything from chapter four through chapter nineteen is a record of the things which are about to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>E. Revelation 1:20</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although the book of Revelation has many mysteries, these mysteries become a clear revelation once they are explained.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all have to admit that the lampstands are the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The seven stars, however, are said to be the seven messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Who then are these messengers?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some have said that these messengers refer to pastors or overseers or bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If this is so, that is, if the messengers refer to something else, then what do the churches refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since the churches are simply the churches and do not refer to something else , then the messengers should simply be messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is one more point.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We know that the messengers explain the mystery of the stars, but if the messengers themselves require further explanation, are we not trying to explain the mystery with another mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We know that the Lord would not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How then should the messengers be explained?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The most accurate answer is that the messengers are messengers just as the churches are simply the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The messengers are the messengers, yet what kind of messengers are they?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>According to the Bible, there are two kinds of messengers: the angels in heaven Matt 22:30 and human messengers Hag 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The messengers here definitely do not refer to the messengers of heaven because: 1 the messengers of heaven, though they serve the church, cannot bear the responsibility of the church; 2 the messengers of heaven are spiritual, and therefore, they cannot receive a physical letter; 3 since this book is revealed to John by the Lord through His angel, it cannot be that the angel writes letters through John to other angels; and 4 the Lord asks the messenger of the church in Smyrna to be faithful unto death Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If this is an angel, how could he fulfill what is described here?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since the messengers are not of heaven, they must be human messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Bible gives examples concerning this in 2 Corinthians 8:23 and Philippians 2:25.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must pay attention to one more point concerning the position of the messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the sense that the messengers are representatives, they represent the churches, they bear substantial responsibility in the church, and they must be persons who have influence in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the position of the messengers with respect to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At the same time, with respect to the Lord, these messengers are represented by the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Stars are able to shine; this speaks of their condition in life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They are also in the hand of the Lord, which implies that they are used by the Lord and that they have authority.</S>
