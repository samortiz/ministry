   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL'S EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider Paul's situation regarding this matter when he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you believe that he was thoroughly resurrected at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At least a small percentage of his being must still have been natural; it was not yet Paul the Apostle, but still Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the way to Damascus, he was enlightened and knocked down to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On that day, he was saved, and his spirit was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, his whole being was not resurrected at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, a great deal more of his being, probably more than ninety-five percent, had been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because he was not fully in resurrection, he was still endeavoring to arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was still in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RESURRECTED UNTO LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My burden in this message is to point out to you that our Christian walk is a matter of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we are all on the way to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul desired to be conformed to Christ's death so that, by any means, he might arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have pointed out, this does not refer merely to the resurrection of the dead in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The future resurrection of the dead will not be a resurrection unto life, but unto judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the dead unbelievers are resurrected, they will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers, however, are resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a resurrection, not unto judgment, but unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we are being resurrected, not for judgment, but for life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Day by day and little by little, we are being resurrected unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time I am resurrected a little more, I have more life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each step of the process of the out-resurrection from among the dead is unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Christian walk is not a matter of behavior or ethics; it is a process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are being processed into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are all in this process, and we are all in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The difference between us is a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, one brother may be fifty-five percent resurrected and another brother, forty-five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to forget the teachings about the improvement of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not try to love others, to control your temper, or to be a good husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, endeavor to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may still be under the concept that you must improve your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the only thing you need to do is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I admit that this is much easier to say than it is to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this matter, we need Christ to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have no burden to help you control your temper or be a good wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My burden is to charge you to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As you are about to love someone, be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As you are about to lose your temper, be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As you are about to go somewhere or do something, be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Simply be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unbelievers cannot be conformed to Christ's death because they do not have the Holy Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But because we have the Holy Spirit within us and because we have been regenerated with the divine life, we can be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to see the vision that God's economy is not a matter of ethics or religion, but of being conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that we need to be buried and remain always in death to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, time after time, we come out of the tomb and thereby stop being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Often we live and act in a natural way, even in doing spiritual things or scriptural things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may act according to the Scriptures, but we are not conformed to the death of Christ in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we are in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy for Christians to give up evil things, but it is very difficult to be conformed to the death of Christ and not to do anything by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nearly fifty years ago I gave up the sinful things, but I am still learning how to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all were born natural, raised to be natural, and educated and trained to be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are continually doing things in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why it is so difficult for us to drop the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In so many things we are not yet resurrected.</S>
