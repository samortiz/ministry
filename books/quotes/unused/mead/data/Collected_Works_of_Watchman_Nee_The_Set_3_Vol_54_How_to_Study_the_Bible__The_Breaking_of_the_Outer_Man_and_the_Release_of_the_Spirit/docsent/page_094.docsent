   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All outward imitations are not God's work; they are man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, every seeking person should learn the inward lessons, not the outward imitations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He should allow God to effect something in him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is through this work that he will derive his outward expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything that a person does in an outward way is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All manmade structures have to be demolished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man puts up something false, he will not only cheat others but also cheat himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we give ourselves to imitations and artificiality, we will gradually be led to believe that we are what we pretend to be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if others point out that we do not have anything real and that we have to get rid of it, we will still wonder whether their words are true.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never imitate anything in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is better to be a little bit more natural in the way we conduct ourselves and allow God to build up something in us instead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should live in a simple and unpretentious way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not engage in any outward imitating or copying; rather, we should look to the Lord to daily add the virtues that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second matter is that some people have some virtues in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, some are naturally very meek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the difference between natural meekness and a meekness that comes as a result of discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should point out two things in reference to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, everything natural is independent; it does not need to be joined to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that comes from the discipline of the Holy Spirit is controlled by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the spirit moves, it moves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the spirit does not move, it does not move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Natural meekness sometimes is a hindrance to the spirit, and anything that hinders the spirit is stubborn in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, even our natural meekness can become a kind of stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man is naturally meek, his meekness is independent; he is meek in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Lord wants him to stand up to say a few severe words, his natural meekness will become a hindrance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will say, "Oh, I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have never said such a thing in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I must let others say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot say that."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this instance his natural meekness is not subject to the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything from the natural realm is motivated by its own will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is stubborn, and it follows its own wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit cannot use it in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, meekness that comes from brokenness is totally different; it is useful to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It offers no resistance, opposition, or opinion but is fully under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, a naturally meek person is meek when his will takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when he is asked to do what he does not want to do, or when something challenges his reluctance, he is meek no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, all natural virtues do not lead to self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All human, natural virtues can only be utilized by man to build up himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not just meekness, but every kind of natural virtue, is used by man to build up himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, whenever his very self is threatened, all of his virtues disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As soon as we touch the innermost self of a naturally meek person, his meekness disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as he comes across something that he is reluctant to do, his humility is gone and his meekness is gone; everything he has is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Virtues that result from discipline are different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These virtues are produced only to the extent that the self is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever God destroys the self, these virtues are made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more the self is wounded, the more the man becomes meek.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a fundamental difference between natural virtues and the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BE STRONG</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot pretend, and we cannot replace it with anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and accept His dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as the outer man is broken, the inner man becomes strong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, a few people are not strong in the inner man in spite of the fact that their outer man has been broken already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the inner man should be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the inner man is not strong when the outer man is broken, we should not pray for strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we should say, "Be strong."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible commands us to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The wonderful thing is that when the outer man is broken, we can be strong when we want to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can be strong when we have to be strong and are determined to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Try this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we say that we will do it, it will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As soon as the problem of the outer man is settled, the issue of being strong is also settled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can and will be strong whenever we want to.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From that day forward, no one can stop us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We only need to say that we will do something or that we are determined to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A little willing and determination will bring about wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord says, "Be strong."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we say that we will be strong in the Lord, we will become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The outer man must be broken before the inner man can find freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the fundamental path that a servant of the Lord must learn to take.</S>
