        <h2 class="head1">LIFE SPREADING FROM OUR SOUL INTO OUR BODY</h2>
<p>If we are willing to allow the life and element of Christ to spread from our spirit into our soul, the life of Christ will spread further into our body. Romans 8:10 speaks of Christ being in us and of our spirit being life because of righteousness. Then verse 11 says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This makes our mortal and weak body living and strong.</p>
<p>Our body is mortal and weak because of the damage of sin. It is especially weak and powerless in the matters of living for the Lord and of doing the Lord&rsquo;s will. From experience we know that our body is unable to meet our needs in relation to spiritual matters (Matt. 26:41). Sometimes our body is weak and powerless, and sometimes the functions of our body are dull and unresponsive. This is because our body has been damaged by sin and is under the weakness that comes through the operation of death. Sin brings in death, and death causes weakness. When sin entered our body, it brought the element of death into our body, making our body and its members full of weakness. This is our condition.</p>
<p>Now, however, we are joined to the Lord in our spirit through the Spirit, making our spirit alive and even life itself (Eph. 2:5; Rom. 8:10). If we allow the Spirit to work in us continually, the life of Christ in our spirit will spread into every part of our being. The Spirit who indwells us will surely cause the life of Christ, which is the resurrection power of Christ, to spread into our body of death and weakness, making our mortal and weak body living and strong (v. 11). Thus, our body will be able to meet our needs in relation to spiritual matters, and it will be filled with the life of Christ, expressing the resurrection power of Christ and giving people a sense of Christ in us.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for some brothers and sisters to be unable to hear spiritual things with their ears, to understand and remember spiritual things with their mind, or to have the physical strength to meet a spiritual need. However, when these brothers and sisters consecrate themselves to the Lord and allow the Spirit to work in them, the Lord&rsquo;s life in their spirit will operate and spread into every part of their being. Their ears and mind will be keen to hear and understand spiritual things, and their physical strength will be adequate to meet the practical needs associated with carrying out spiritual matters. The Spirit causes the Lord&rsquo;s life to spread from our spirit into our body so that our weak and powerless body can be strong and powerful. Thus, the divine life will not only fill our spirit but also our soul and body. Then our whole being will begin to express the image of Christ to the extent that this life spreads in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>As we continually appropriate the redemption of God and allow God to work in us, Christ will spread outward from our spirit and be expressed in us, and we will be transformed and conformed to His image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29). When we allow God to work in us through the Spirit, we will be transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFIGURED</h2>
<p>When we are transformed to this extent, our spirit will be joined as one with the Lord, our soul will bear His image, and our body will glorify Him. In such a condition of maturity, we will be ready to be transfigured. The ultimate manifestation of our appropriation of the redemption of God will be the transfiguration of the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory.</p>
<p>Through the work of the Spirit, our spirit and every part of our soul will be transformed into the image of Christ, and our body will be made living, strong, keen, and powerful through its transfiguration. We have not yet put off the old creation completely, because our body and its humiliation are still part of the old creation. Nevertheless, the Lord will carry out this final step when the body of our humiliation is transfigured to be &ldquo;conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). At that time we will be exactly the same as Christ from center to circumference; that is, our spirit, soul, and body will be full of His element. We will have His life and nature inwardly, and we will express His image outwardly, fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain many people, who have the life of the Firstborn and bear His image, to be the many brothers of the Firstborn. From God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son in our spirit through faith to the transfiguration of our body in glory, all God&rsquo;s work in us is directed toward the goal of conforming us to the image of His Son.</p>
<p>When the Lord transfigures our body to be like His body of glory, His goal will be accomplished, and His eternal plan will be fulfilled. At that time Christ will lead many sons into glory, and we will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:21). As those who have the life and the image of Christ and who have entered into the glory and freedom of Christ, we will be like Him and be manifested together with Him in glory as His glorious partners in whom He is fully expressed.</p>
<p>At that time, just as Christ has the divine life and nature as well as the human life and nature in glory, we also will have the divine life and nature as well as the human life and nature in glory. Just as Christ expresses the glory of His divinity in His humanity, we also will express the glory of His divinity in our humanity. Just as God is expressed in the Son, the Son will also be expressed in us.</p>
<p>The expression of the Son in us is simply the expression of God in His Son in us. At that time we will express Christ in glory. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption and the issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption. May we all see this and take this as the goal of our pursuit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
