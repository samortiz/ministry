   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PICTURES OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spiritual things of the New Testament are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because they are mysterious, it is difficult to describe them or define them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, the Bible follows the principle of illustrating spiritual things by shadows, figures, and types.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is similar to the way children are taught to read in school.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Along with the word "dog," the teacher will show the children a picture of a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord that the Bible firstly affords a picture and then the plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament we have the types and pictures, and in the New Testament we have the definition, the fulfillment, of the types and pictures of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's way in His wisdom is to use pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most comprehensive picture in the Old Testament is that of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The entire nation of Israel is a great picture of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has had two peoples, one in the Old Testament, the children of Israel, and the other in the New Testament, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's people in the Old Testament are a type of His people in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the church is a mysterious entity, it cannot be easily described.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, God employs the picture of the children of Israel to enable us to have a clear understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to look at the picture first and then read the definition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the church came into being, there was already a picture of the church in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the church has now come into existence, it is nevertheless difficult to understand the church because it is a spiritual entity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we still need the picture of the church in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children of Israel observed a feast called the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first Passover feast was celebrated in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The record of this is in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the children of Israel fled from Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to 1 Corinthians 5 and 10, both the Passover and the crossing of the Red Sea were types.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Passover is a type of Christ enjoyed in the church, and the crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism, which is practiced in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although many teachers and theologians have seen that the early history of the children of Israel is a type, most have neglected the fact that their later history is also a type.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire history of the children of Israel is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PLACE GOD HAS CHOSEN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us turn now to Deuteronomy 12.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word was given at the time the children of Israel were about to enter into the good land to possess it and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses was charged by the Lord to command the children of Israel concerning the place where they were to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this chapter Moses seemed to be saying, "In the wilderness you did what was right in your own eyes, not what was right in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But now as you are about to enter the good land, I must warn you to be careful about the place where you worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The place of worship is not a matter of your choice, but of the Lord's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You cannot worship God in the place of your choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, you must go to the place the Lord has chosen."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sixteen times in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 Moses refers to the place which the Lord would choose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Moses was so concerned for the children of Israel, he charged them about this again and again.</S>
