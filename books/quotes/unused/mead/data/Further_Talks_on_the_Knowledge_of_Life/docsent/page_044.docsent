   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOURCE AND EXECUTOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law of life is called the law of the Spirit of life in the Bible Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With regard to this designation, there is a special relationship between this law and God s life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s life is the source of this law, and the Spirit is the Executor of this law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The life of God is the inner content of God, and the Spirit is the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When referring to God s life the stress is on His nature, and when referring to His person the stress is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the law of life has God s life as its source and the Spirit as its Executor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law of life is very strong because both God s life and the Spirit are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE WORK OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human beings consist of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition to the body without, there are also the spirit and soul within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the spirit, there are the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, and in the soul, there are the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, simply stated, our inner being consists of two parts the spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Stated in more detail, our inner being consists of six parts conscience, intuition, fellowship, mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our heart is composed of four parts: the mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The mind is the thinking part of the soul, the emotion is the feeling part of the soul, and the will is the deciding part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the heart also includes a part of the spirit, that is, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the record in the Bible, these four parts the mind, emotion, will, and conscience are related to the heart Prov 2:10; Psa 139:14; 1 Sam 18:1; S. S. 1:7; Job 7:15; Heb 10:22; 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE HEART BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The heart is a combination of the soul and the spirit, including all the parts of the soul and one of the three parts of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The three parts of the soul mind, emotion, and will are related to man s behavior, living, and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The conscience of the spirit is also related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The other two parts of the spirit intuition and fellowship are related to God, not to man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The parts related to God are not included in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the part related to man, that is, the conscience, is included in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the three parts of the soul are related to man, they are also related to the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heart, therefore, is the representative of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The major part of the heart is the soul, but only a small part of the heart is related to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These four parts together equal the heart, which is the representative of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE LOCATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF THE LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where in us did God put His life?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God put His life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When His life enters into our spirit, it produces a law, and this law spreads out from our spirit into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When this law spreads to a certain part, it becomes the law of that part.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, there is a law in our conscience, in our mind, in our emotion, in our will, in our fellowship, and in our intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In each of the six parts of our inner being there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the law within us, it often uses the plural form laws.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is only one law, but when this law operates and reaches a certain part of our inner being, it becomes the law of that part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This may be compared to electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When electricity, which is uniquely one, is transmitted into a microphone, it becomes the electricity of the microphone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When it is transmitted into a fan, it becomes the electricity of the fan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When it is transmitted into many rooms, it becomes the electricity of each room.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, the electricity is one, and on the other hand, it seems to be many.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a law of life within us, and when this law operates and reaches the different parts of our being, it becomes the law of each individual part.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These many laws, however, are only one law in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE HOLY SPIRIT RENEWING OUR WHOLE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THROUGH THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the law of life enters into our mind, how does it become the law of our mind?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When it enters into our emotion, how does it become the law of our emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When it enters into our will, how does it become the law of our will?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s work of salvation is accomplished by renewing us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God regenerates us, He renews our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He desires to spread outward from our spirit into our soul to renew the soul; this renewing work is carried out by the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The law of life is the operation of the Spirit, a function of the Spirit; it is a function of the operation of the Spirit in us.</S>
