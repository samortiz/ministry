   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God s new creation Rom 8:21 , and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings 1 Pet 1:6; 4:12; 3:14; 5:9 into a new realm, full of glory 1 Pet 4:13; 5:10 , sharing and enjoying all the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained.</S>
