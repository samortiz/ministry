   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROWTH IN LIFE ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we enjoy such a Christ, we will surely grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter we saw that the growth in life issues in the development of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also have to realize that according to 1 Corinthians 3, the growth in life first issues in the precious materials for the building up of the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6-7, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For us to be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones is not for individual spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the materials, we must be precious because we are for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The growth in life first issues in the precious materials for God's building and then in the development of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To build any kind of building, first you need the materials.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then you need the skills to build it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The materials and the skills are the issues of the growth in life by our enjoyment of the all-inclusive, processed Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life is the church built with the materials and by the skills.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE EXCELLING GIFT OF PROPHESYING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapter thirteen Paul tells us that love is above prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 8 says that love will remain forever, but prophecies shall be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter thirteen Paul made love higher than all the gifts, but in chapter fourteen he made prophesying more desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that Paul was promoting prophesying in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Philippians 3 Paul promoted one thing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ was promoted to the top by Paul in that chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He annulled and belittled everything else to the extent that everything other than Christ was dung v. 8 . In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul also promoted prophesying to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 12 he says, "Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The adjective "zealous" is actually the noun "zealots" in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does Paul mean when he says the Corinthians were zealots of spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 3:14 says that the promised Spirit is the very blessing of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The top blessing in God's salvation given to us by God is God Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before they were saved, the Corinthians were zealous for demonic spirits, but now that they are saved, they should be zealous for the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now that they are believers, they need to seek the excelling Holy Spirit for the excelling gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word "excel" may also be translated into "abound."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the context of this verse is one of comparison, that is, one of comparing prophecy with speaking in tongues, "excel" is the right translation here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul is not talking of abundance or scarcity but of being low or excelling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To speak in tongues is too low, whereas to prophesy is to excel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should seek to excel for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul promoted prophesying so highly because this is the top gift that builds up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, Christ was promoted by Paul to the uttermost in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything other than Him is dung.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, in building up the Body of Christ, nothing is higher than prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 14:4 Paul says, "He who prophesies builds up the church."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Corinthians 14 is a chapter on prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the goal of the entire book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians is on the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life, and this growth accomplishes two things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, it produces the precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, it issues in the gifts, which are the skills, the techniques, to build up the church of Christ with the precious materials produced by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, this book begins with the enjoyment of Christ and consummates with the built up church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul promoted prophesying, but he did not tell us how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 31, though, he says, "You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn..."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we speak something and others learn something, that means that we ourselves had to learn first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To speak in tongues is purely miraculous and does not require any learning, but to prophesy is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the one who hears the prophecy learns, the prophesier has to learn first.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul charges and urges us to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a sense, he even requires us to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as we are Christians, members of Christ, we must prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul was burdened to perfect the saints to prophesy.</S>
