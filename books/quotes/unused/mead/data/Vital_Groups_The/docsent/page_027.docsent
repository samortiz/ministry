   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous message we saw that shepherding and teaching are in Christ's ministry for carrying out God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see the shepherding and teaching in the gifted persons and in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Shepherding and teaching are the essential functions in the gifts among the gifted persons given by Christ the ascended Head to the churches for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Shepherding 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Ministry of the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists Depending upon Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the four kinds of gifted persons, the ministry of the first three, that is, of the apostles, prophets, and evangelists, depends upon shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is confirmed by the Lord's charge to Peter in John 21:15-17.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The functions of these leading gifted persons depend upon shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without shepherding, the apostles, prophets, and evangelists cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The preaching of the gospel is the top shepherding of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus was the first New Testament preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John the Baptist was the forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first gospel preacher, Christ, carried out His ministry by shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He went to Jericho just to visit one person, a chief tax collector Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not go there to hold a big gospel campaign with thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His desire was to preach the gospel to gain one person, and His preaching was a shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 4 says that while the Lord was on His way to Galilee, "He had to pass through Samaria" v. 4 . He detoured from the main way to Sychar, near Jacob's well, in order to contact a sinful Samaritan woman, who previously had five husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord foreknew that she would come to the well of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The well of Jacob is a type of Christ, who is the spring of water gushing up into eternal life v. 14b . We have to learn of the Lord's pattern in purposely detouring to Sychar to gain only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To spend three years to gain one person is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you spend three years to visit one person continually, you will gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After twelve years you will have four new ones following you to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one hundred saints in a local church practice this, their number can be increased to five hundred after twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this light we need to consider how much increase we have had in our locality in the past twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is the increase among us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proper increase is due to the gospel shepherding, and shepherding means that we have to go and visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ visited the sinners by coming down from heaven to earth to find the lost sheep, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to learn of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 21 is a chapter on shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our crystallization-study of the Gospel of John we saw that this chapter is not merely an appendix but also the completion and consummation of the Gospel of John, a book on Christ being God coming to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The writer of this Gospel spent twenty chapters to unveil such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, such a book has a conclusion on shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not know what shepherding is, the entire Gospel of John will be in vain to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only when we shepherd others that we can know John in an intrinsic way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Shepherding is the key to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 21:15 says, "Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter said, "Lord, You know," because he had denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He lost his natural confidence in his love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In restoring Peter's love toward Him, the Lord charged him to shepherd and feed His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In his first Epistle, Peter spoke in 2:25 of Christ being the Shepherd and Overseer of our soul, our inner being and real person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in 5:1-2 he told the elders that their obligation is to shepherd God's flock according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to God means that we must live God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must have God on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have God in our understanding, in our theology, and in our teaching, but we may not live God when we are shepherding people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are one with God, we become God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we have God and are God in our shepherding of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To shepherd according to God is to shepherd according to what God is in His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to God is at least according to these four attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must shepherd the young ones, the weak ones, and the backsliding ones according to these four attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will be good shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without shepherding, there is no way for us to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John is the Gospel of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to enjoy life and minister life to others, we must shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real ministering of life is shepherding by visiting and contacting people.</S>
