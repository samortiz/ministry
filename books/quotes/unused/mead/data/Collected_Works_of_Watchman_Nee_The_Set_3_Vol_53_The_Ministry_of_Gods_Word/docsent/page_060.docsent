   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRAINING OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must not waste our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to treasure and conserve every bit and every drop of our mental energy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more powerful and enriched our thoughts are, the higher we will climb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should never waste our thoughts on useless things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can tell how useful people are with respect to the ministry of God's word by the way they use their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man wastes and squanders his thoughts on vain things, how can he have any capacity for thoughts pertaining to God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A subjective person is useless because he constantly thinks about his own things, looks at his own surroundings, and is fettered by his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more his thoughts revolve around himself, the less he can put his thoughts to good use.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot allow our thoughts to constantly be wild, confused, unchecked, and untamed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must not allow our thoughts to remain low by constantly walking according to the flesh, setting the mind on the flesh, and minding the things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do, we will have little room in our mind for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ministry of the word needs the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our thoughts have been dealt with, we will catch and retain the light when the word appears in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Light tends to run away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We often lament how hopeless our mind is in catching God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as our mind is occupied with other things, God's light runs away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our thoughts must be like a servant waiting at the doorstep of the master.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the pathway of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to know this pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bear in mind that light comes quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many things are contained in its speedy flash.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only those whose thoughts are perfect, lofty, rich, and clear have the ability to retain the contents of that flash.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even then we should realize that there are still many things God wants us to see which we cannot retain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The perplexing thing is that we know that there is a speaking in our spirit and that this speaking has a certain significance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we do not know what the significance is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that we have lost something, but we do not know what has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind is short in its useful capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should realize that even the sharpest mind in the world is short of capacity for God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we waste it on useless things, it will be even less productive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never allow our thoughts to freely roam; this is not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Light can only be retained by minds, and it is only useful in accordance with its retention in our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Light is spiritual and runs away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to retain the light, our minds have to be powerful, rich, and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is great, and our ability to discover the extent of His shining and speaking is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, when He shines, our thoughts must be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even when we come to the Lord, we often feel that we are short and that our minds do not match the need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times we are conscious of the poverty of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We lose many things and miss much shining.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How much worse will our situation become if we waste our thoughts on distracting things!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to discipline our mind before the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way we use our thoughts is very much related to the way we function as ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ministry of the word has dried up in many people because they have wasted their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is like a man who wastes his energy making wrong turns; he does not have any energy to take the right pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people waste their thoughts away; they have no energy left for the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers, do not think that our mind is unrelated to the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that our mind is related very much to the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While it is certainly true that thoughts cannot replace the shining of the Spirit, they are necessary in order to understand the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we must not waste our thoughts at ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people engage their thoughts in unnecessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, they cannot capture the light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man is poor in his thoughts because he has too many desires.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to learn to conserve our thoughts; we must not waste them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am not saying that we should not use our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am saying that we should not waste them on distracting things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Much mental energy can be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we waste our God-given mental capacity on unnecessary things, we will find that there is no capacity for the understanding of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are many minor issues in the Bible, the discernment of which is not critical.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not waste our thoughts on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, we should realize that we cannot solve every spiritual problem with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may be able to think of solutions, but we cannot solve them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Spiritual problems can only be solved by God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people use up all their energy in trying to solve biblical riddles or spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They waste their thoughts on doctrines and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if they think that they have solved these problems, others only come into contact with their thoughts when they touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The greatest loss comes with the inability to retain God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The mind's usefulness lies in its ability to capture the shining of God's light as it breaks forth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A minister of the word must learn the important lesson of employing his thoughts in useful matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He must put his thoughts in a suitable place where God's light can shine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He should not put his thoughts in a place where God's light cannot shine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot see anything just by using our thoughts alone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God must first shine on us before we can exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do we see this way?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not come to the Bible with our mind alone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before we can exercise our mind to translate the light and before we see anything, God must first shine.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if our mind is open to Him, we will see God's light, and we will take the first step in receiving God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord create ministers of the word among us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without the ministers of the word, the church will always be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A man must receive the supply of God's word before he can minister to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The problem today lies in man, in the channel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When God's light shines on us, it first has to get through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Light is in our spirit, but it first must pass through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since the light is in our spirit, how can we expect to have a powerful ministry if it is discounted as soon as it reaches our mind?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a very basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May the Lord grant us to know the way of the ministry of the word.</S>
