Today the Lord is asking us also, "How would you answer?" Are you a religionist, a social worker, a philosopher, or a revolutionist? Even if you say that He is a prophet, He is still not satisfied. Do you confess that He is the Christ?</P><P>Verses 16-17:Bar means "son" and jona means "dove"; hence, Barjona means having the revelation of the Holy Spirit. People's observation of the Lord and their discussion about Him were inaccurate because they did not have the revelation of God. They went only by their own view, and therefore, the Lord was not satisfied. At this time the Lord again asked the disciples. When Peter answered as he did, that was the time of his regeneration (1 John 5:1; 4:15). The name Christ means that He is the One in whom God's hope (or plan) is accomplished. Peter said, "You are the only One who accomplishes God's hope and plan." Whenever the name Christ is mentioned, it is related to the Lord's work. Whenever the title the Son of God is mentioned, it is related to the Lord's person and His personal glory. The Lord has threefold glory: (1) personal glory, the glory He has in eternity as God; (2) human glory, the glory He had on the earth as a man; and (3) moral glory. Peter always spoke (see 1 Peter); his acknowledging signifies two things: (1) the Lord's work and person, and (2) his own regeneration. Simon was Peter's old name. Barjona means the son of the Holy Spirit; this indicates being born of the Spirit. We are blessed if we confess the Lord as Christ, for such confession indicates that we have received the revelation of the Holy Spirit. It is wrong to trust in theology or mere preachings. We are Christians not by reasoning but by revelation (see Gal. 1:16). God has given us four great revelations: (1) the revelation of nature, such as the heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars; (2) the Book-the Holy Scriptures; (3) the most --the Holy Spirit; and (4) Jesus. The revelation of the Holy Spirit is most important, for without it, no one can be saved.</P><P>Verse 18:"And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." "Also say." One thing has been said already; now He will go on to the second thing. By this word we know that at that time the building of the church had not begun. Peter (Petros) means "a little stone." Here rock in Greek is Petra, meaning "a large stone." Therefore, these are two different kinds of stones. The church cannot be built on Petros; no one builds a house on a small stone. Peter was only a small stone; the rock (Petra) is the Lord Jesus (1 Pet. 2:7-8). Peter confessed the Lord and therefore became a small stone. Hence, whoever confesses the Lord is also a small stone, that is, a living stone to be built into a spiritual house, the church, the dwelling place of God (1 Pet. 2:5). This rock is the Lord Christ whom Peter confessed. If the rock was Peter, the church would have been in great jeopardy when he trembled at the sight of a maid and denied the Lord three times. Without such a confession, there can be no church. The eunuch first had to confess before Philip would baptize him. The church (ekklesia) is a called-out congregation. This congregation is called out and separated unto holiness, that is, separated from the world, sin, temper, etc., as the fruit of the Spirit. Therefore, every saint is holy and every saved one is sanctified. Hebrews 9:13-14 says that we are sanctified by the blood.</P><P>"Gates of Hades." Gates are entrances and exits. Hades cannot block the coming in and going out; death cannot hold the believers or the church, for the incorruptible life has been manifested in man (2 Tim. 1:10). The body of Christ: (1) the Lord's physical body, which expresses the Lord's divine life; and (2) the church on the earth which the Lord put on after His resurrection and ascension. Hence, the church is the place where the Lord deposits His life today. Because the incorruptible life has come out from Hades, the Lord has the authority to allow life to freely come in and out of Hades. The Lord has put into the believers the life that cannot be held by Hades. This means that He has regenerated them. We already have this life, which cannot be held by Hades. We will also be resurrected first, because we have this life. The life of the unbelievers is seized by Hades after their death. Resurrection means a life that cannot be held by death. This is also true while we are in our body today. The environment may be deplorable-trials, persecutions, violence, killings, etc. It seems that we have walls all around us. Yet we have the life that cannot be held back, and no environment can overcome us.</P><P>Verse 19:"I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens." This verse is easily misinterpreted. Were the keys of the kingdom of the heavens given only to Peter? Does the binding refer to forgiveness of sins? The Catholic Church has this kind of wrong interpretation, and so does the Anglican Church. They both believe that the church has the authority to forgive sins. Are the keys (the Greek word being plural in number) (1) for the Jews-at Pentecost, and (2) for the Gentiles-at the house of Cornelius? Different people do not make the keys different. One does not have one kind of key for Mr. Wong and another kind of key for Mr. Lee, for the same door. Verse 18 mentions the gates of Hades, which are versus the gates of the kingdom of the heavens. The subject in verse 18 is the church, whereas the subject in verse 19 is the kingdom of the heavens. The church in verse 18 is to be built by the Lord, and the kingdom of the heavens is to be built by men. Here it does not say "The keys of the church" but "The keys of the kingdom of the heavens." Otherwise, Peter would have truly become a pope. The church is built by the Lord, and it is constituted of those who have been regenerated, who have received life, and who have the inspiration of the Spirit. This is not something revealed by flesh and blood but by the Father who is in the heavens. In the kingdom of the heavens God gives us the right to be believers. Yet in this kingdom of the heavens we have our duty and responsibility as disciples. Here it seems that the Lord was saying to Peter, "You can bring people into the kingdom of the heavens." (To say that he brought people into the church is the greatest blasphemy.) This was the first step, the first thing that brought men into the kingdom of the heavens. This key was in Peter's hand. The first few things used by Peter to bring people into the kingdom of the heavens are seen in Acts. (1) Peter had the key of testifying-his preaching on the day of Pentecost. (2) He had the key of baptizing people-he charged people to be baptized into Christ (Rom. 6:3), to be in subjection to His command and thus to obey Him. Therefore, in Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to "disciple all the nations"; this is the first key. Then He tells us to baptize them into the name of the Triune God; this is the second key. Therefore, a person who is not baptized is in the church but not in the kingdom of the heavens (see Matt. 21:31-32; cf. Acts 2:47; 16:5, which say that the Lord added to the church daily). Preachers can only bring people into the kingdom of the heavens, which is the business office of the church. There may be tares in the kingdom of the heavens, but not in the church.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
