<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (5)</H1><P>Date:Monday, 6:30 p.m., April 12, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><P>Brother Chu-en asked: Will the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch become another form of a "central" church or "head" church?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEING THE BODY LIFE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Holy Spirit Being<br>the Starting Point of the Work</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: Our work today does not begin from Antioch. Nor does it begin from Jerusalem. Our work today begins from the Holy Spirit. The basic question is the starting point of our work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Work Being Carried Out in the Body</H2><P>We have to realize that the church is a Body. As such is the case, our work cannot be carried out individually, but it must be carried out in a corporate way. Neither can we be a Christian individually. Perhaps a person is a well-behaved Christian. However, he must be put together with others before his real condition is made manifest. Only those who know the Body will deal with themselves and coordinate with others. A man may have the greatest achievements and may appear to be very spiritual. But this should not be mistaken as true progress and true spirituality. Only by working with others will we realize whether there is true progress and whether the self is truly dealt with. When the self assumes the throne, it sees no one but itself. But if the self is dealt with, we will see others and will not see ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body Being the Test of Spirituality</H2><P>We must always bear in mind that our life is but a part of the whole. We must live together with the whole. There are severe disciplines in the Body. The way of the Body is the cross. Those who have not seen the cross do not see the Body. When relatives live far away from one another, they maintain good harmony. But when they move close together, they become enemies. When a person lives in a house by himself, there is comfort and bliss. But when two brothers live together, they have to learn to take the cross. The more people live together and the closer they are to one another, the more crosses there are. Sometimes a person is put in a situation where he has crosses all over him. What man considers as spiritual progress does not count unless it can pass the test of the Body. The only thing that will count is that which can pass the test of the Body. No matter how great a person's works are, how many gifts he has, and how much life he possesses, if he is not in the Body, none of these matters count. Only when a person puts himself among the co-workers and the brothers and sisters will he know how much he has been delivered from the self and how much he knows about the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Accepting the Limitations and<br>the Coordination in the Body</H2><P>The first thing we have to know is the Body of Christ. Once a person sees the Body of Christ, spontaneously he will see coordination. In the Body, the Lord has His assigned authorities. Who is an authority? Whoever has the ministry has the authority. Ministry is authority. We have to accept our own limitations. We must realize that we are only one minister before the Lord and that we have to work together with other ministers before we can meet the need. We should seek for coordination. When one member cannot meet the need, he needs the coordination of the other members. Only by coordination can we receive the supply from the Body everywhere we go. A man needs the coordination of the other members. At the same time, he needs to accept the limitations of the Body.</P>
