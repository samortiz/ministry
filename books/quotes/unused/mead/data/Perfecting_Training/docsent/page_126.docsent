   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us come back to the first question: Why is the Spirit not mentioned, but Christ is mentioned?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse Paul is emphasizing that today Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ in you is exactly the same as Christ in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In resurrection Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past we have given a number of messages saying that these three titles the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s writing in verses 9 and 10 is to show us that these are not three, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not the only ones who have seen the light concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Vincent s Word Studies in the New Testament, he strongly stresses in his notes on 2 Corinthians 3:17 that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other writers, such as Dean Alford and Williston Walker, have pointed out, that in our Christian experience, Christ is just identical to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fact and Experience</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me add another word according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 9 it refers to our experience, and in verse 10 it refers to the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is altogether a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the Spirit of Christ is also a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do experience that the Spirit of God who is the Spirit of Christ dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But verse 10 does not refer to experience that much; it refers to the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, you have to realize that the experience and the fact are actually the same thing in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 9 there is the aspect of experience, and in verse 10 there is the aspect of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, for the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Christ to dwell in us is an experience, but on the other hand, it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 9 talks about the experience, and verse 10 talks about the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to experience it is the Spirit who dwells in you, but according to fact, Christ dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can you know this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can only know this kind of thing by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is the Spirit who dwells in you, when you come to worship or to pray you would rarely say, O Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spontaneously, you would say, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you pray, you pray based upon the experience, but you refer to the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to be careful to follow my word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be based upon experience is one thing, but to refer to the fact is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In experience He is the Spirit, but as a fact for us to refer to He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although it is not wrong to pray, O Spirit, how I thank You, it is not fitting with the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So you pray, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of praying does not refer to what you experience, but to the fact that today the One who dwells in you is Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is altogether foolish to oppose the teaching that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It indicates a lack of knowledge and a lack of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do have adequate experience, we would fully realize that in our experience He is the Spirit, but when we refer to this as a fact, He is our Lord; He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And these are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus today is both the Spirit and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For us to experience Him, He is the Spirit; for us to worship Him, to call on Him, to mention Him, His title is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don t consider that this is a thorough answer to the first question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later on we have to see something further of the difference between these two titles: the Spirit of Christ and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE BODY WHICH IS DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to realize that you are not a simple person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, on the other hand, you are life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have a body, and you have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And you yourself are a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soul is understood here and implied in the plural pronouns.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the clause, if Christ is in you, you implies the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You are a soul; outside you have a body; inside you have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your body is dead, and your spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>An unbeliever s situation is just the opposite: his spirit is dead, and his body is really alive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But for a bonafide, typical, genuine believer in Christ, part of our being our outward part is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The other part the inward part is life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For an unbeliever, the inward part is dead, and the outward part is living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How can you know that as a believer your body is dead?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By Christ being in you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without Christ in you, you could not realize that your body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ in you exposes the dead situation of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Dead really means disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our body is not only disabled but even altogether stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more I have Christ within me, the more I realize that my body is altogether disabled and stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The unbelievers don t realize that their body is disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, they realize and experience that their body is able.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is able in doing many things stealing, lying, killing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But with us believers, our experience is that our body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many times I pray that the Lord would strengthen all the dear saints into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although your body is dead, your spirit is not only living; it is life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The problem is this: to what part should we listen?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Should we listen to the outward part which is dead or to the inward part which is life?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When, according to our dead body, we would sometimes forget about the meeting, something rises up within us to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That is our spirit which is life.</S>
