   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sometimes this separation occurs among the most genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is, of course, a sin, for believers ought not to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet those who are not willing to bear the cross, who are afraid of paying a high price, who have not heard God's calling, and whose hearts are not single enough to know the Lord's way of leading His people will have to bear the responsibility for this separation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are responsible to tell others that the Lord never leads His own children to take opposite paths.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is possible to be diversified in our ways, but if our ways are opposite one to another, it means that some are not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never believe that because the believers are simple and foolish, they therefore have no more need of God's light to shine on their path.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man commits an error and falls, it is not because God is unwilling to give Him the light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The light of the whole body is the eyes, for they are the entrance of light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of man's problems come in at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, if there is division among genuine Christians, the responsibility is not on those who leave behind the things shown by God as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, the responsibility is on those who join and communicate with sinful things and who ostracize those who are truly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, if everyone leaves behind the unscriptural things, where can there again be distinctions?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one sincerely departs from evil, it is not a cause for division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, it is an excellent help to join and unite believers together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a position, when the Holy Spirit is not grieved or infringed upon, He will properly join together His people and will strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit cannot be united to evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If one wants to be united to evil, that is, to everything that is contrary to the Bible, naturally the result will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not agree with, nor do we underestimate the sin of division.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The many divisions in Protestantism are a shame to Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man considers this as a glory, he lacks a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many think that the variety of denominations nowadays is good in that it provides different people with different religious flavors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is surely a fact, but this same fact tells us the naturalness and unspiritualness of such denominationalism!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, errors are multifarious, contradictory, and divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although truth is also multi-faceted, there is only one truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, the church of God can encompass all those who are of God, whether they be old, young, or infants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although intelligence can vary and understanding can be different, it is still possible to preserve the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To the extent that the name of Christ is not put to shame, the church of God requires that we receive those who have views different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only should we receive them, but we should love them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is vastly different from the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man adheres strictly to the content of the creeds, he will not tolerate anything that deviates in the slightest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man has to acknowledge a creed in its most crucial points as well as in its minutest details.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He must believe that a baby is regenerated when he is sprinkled, in the same way that he believes in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, we know that sometimes man does not adhere to the creeds that strictly, but a righteous Christian will not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he does not believe in the creed, he should leave the organization that subscribes to the creed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he does not leave it, then his minimum duty is to adhere strictly to the creeds, even those he does not agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, for those who know God and whose eyes are open, how can they follow the direction of man's creeds, charters, and constitutions in the things of God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely they cannot and dare not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, no matter which way one looks at it, "division in the body" is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever price one pays to separate himself from sin is good and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, whenever we see God's children awakened, they are no longer able to cooperate with their former denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Initially, there is self-examination and zeal; eventually, one sees the sin of the denominations or other organizations and will suffer at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he takes grace from God, he will forsake this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, after this revival, failure comes when man does not realize God's special way which He has ordained for His children in the midst of the church's failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many are trying to organize an apostolic church at the present time when there are no more apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely they are bound to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Scarcely can we find one person who has a genuine desire to return to the primitive church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not surprising at all, because it is impossible to return to it anyway!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the common thing that we see is the removal of an old organization only to be replaced by a new organization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the truths received in the great revivals turn organizational, they lose their initial power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The decline of power is directly proportional to the increase in organization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we consider the people used by God in church history to revive the life of His children, we will realize that they were all men of faith, power, love, and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who followed them were mostly pure, simple, and clear people, but when the number of followers increased, organization came in. Then, the freshness of power was gradually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the founder leaves, in three to four generations, the organization becomes the same as the old organizations that they had abandoned before!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then, there is the need of another new denomination or sect to replace it!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason that there are now over fifteen hundred denominations of various sizes in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To boast of the past glorious history of persons in a denomination is a proof that the denomination is sick, because it has lost its former power!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many think that organizations and creeds are there to preserve the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, have the organizations and creeds ever preserved the truths that man desires to preserve?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the question we wish to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The honest ones must concede that they never preserve.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What God gives to man can never be preserved by man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If man can believe in God's giving of grace, he should believe in God's preserving of such grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God gave truth to man through His own words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet man turns around and creates a creed out of God's word under the excuse of the preservation of God's truth!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What their posterity follows is not God's own word but the creeds of their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Spirit and life are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is kept outside of them, and He has to work again to raise up another group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These are the conditions of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They demonstrate to us the Lord's verdict: "You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should pay attention to the fact that the Lord is talking about the condition in the Protestant organization as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not refer to any one particular denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if we are most undiscerning, we have to admit that the condition in Protestantism is indeed as described here.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The situation everywhere testifies to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At present, almost all the real works of gospel preaching and edification of the saints are done by believers outside the Protestant-recognized denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They are all done outside the recognized denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Protestantism has become an empty name only.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is full of man-made ceremonies.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is indeed pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The corruption of Jezebel is not as lamentable as this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The prevalence of sin stirs up our indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is most sad that what begins as the work of God ends up in death and coldness.</S>
