   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Change of Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may think that because a sheepfold is something prepared by God we should remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may point to chapter ten of the Gospel of John and ask, "Wasn't the Old Testament sheepfold established by God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Certainly God established this fold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why, then, didn't the Lord Jesus leave His sheep in the fold?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the time of the Old Testament, it was right for the sheep to remain in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the sheep should no longer stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Religious Leaders Not Recognizing the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many religious things in the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the fold people may have the Scriptures, and in name they may also have God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when the Son of God came, those in the Old Testament sheepfold did not recognize Him or receive Him, but rather rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle is the same with the sheepfolds that have been established after the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those in today's sheepfolds may talk about serving Christ, but some of them might not recognize Him if He appeared in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The religious leaders in the Old Testament sheepfold had strong religious teachings concerning Christ, the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when Christ actually came, those religionists, who supposedly were for the Messiah, did not recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead of receiving Him, they rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This made it necessary for the Lord to be the door for His sheep to go out of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through Him the sheep came out of the fold, not to enter another fold but to be His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Difference between the Fold and the Flock</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A fold is a religious organization, and the one flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because some Christians have not been clear concerning this distinction, they use the word "fold" when they should use the word "flock."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, a certain gospel song speaks of the "wondrous grace that brought me to the fold."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, the Lord's grace does not bring us into a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, by grace the Lord brings us out of the fold into the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be brought into a fold is to be brought into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Grace does not bring us into darkness grace always brings us into light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life is in the light, not in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we are in the pasture under Christ as our sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now in the pasture and in the daylight, we enjoy Christ as life in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Freedom from Legality</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The door in John 10 also signifies freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Christ we have the freedom to go in and out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that we do not have any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The freedom we enjoy is Christ as our life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because Christ is our freedom, our door, nothing can bind us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not bound by any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean, of course, that we are free to indulge the flesh Gal 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The point here is that in the church life we are in a condition where we are not in bondage to legality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom, and we are not bound by anything legal.</S>
