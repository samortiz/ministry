In this lesson we continue Volume Three of Level Two to cover the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation
As regenerated people, we have both the old 'I,' which has been crucified , and a new 'I,' which has been regenerated
On the one hand Paul had been terminated but on the other hand a resurrected Paul one who was regenerated with God as his life still lived
Although Paul said No longer I he also said It is Christ who lives in me for it was Christ who lived but it was in Paul that He lived
After a branch is grafted into a tree, the branch still lives, yet not by itself, but by the tree into which it has been grafted
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
We must live and move continually in the mingled spirit that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the good land
In the New Testament nothing is more basic, more important, and more powerful than walking according to the mingled spirit
Christ is not only the food but also the bread of life to us; He is our life supply to sustain our spiritual life
Thessalonians 5:10 says that Christ 'died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him'
In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, 'It is Christ who lives in me,' and in Philippians 1:21 he said, 'To me, to live is Christ'
Not only do we live by Christ, live together with Christ, live in Christ, and live for Christ, but we also live Christ
Because Christ lives in us, we can live Him by enjoying His divine dispensing and thus be one with Him both in life and in living
When we magnify Christ, we display to the whole universe that the Christ who lives in us and the Christ whom we live is unlimited
By rejoicing in the Lord in his sufferings, he showed forth the unlimitedness of the Christ whom he experienced and enjoyed
We can walk in Him and enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived and walked in the good land and enjoyed all its rich produce
Christ eventually is realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit; hence, to walk in Him is to walk in the all-inclusive Spirit
He also enables us to magnify Him, that is, to display to the entire universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited
The circumcision here refers to the New Testament believers, who are genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
At his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became 'a man in Christ'
Now he expected to be found in Christ, not in culture, philosophy, or religion, by all who observed him-the Jews, the angels, and the demons
With Paul, all things in verse 8 refers mainly to three categories of things-religion, philosophy, and culture
In Philippians 3:10 Paul said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings'
Here, to know Christ is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him
We first receive the revelation of Christ and then seek for the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way
According to Paul's concept, if we would know Christ in an experiential way, we must first gain Christ and be found in Him
To be found in Him requires us first to count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
Not only do we seek to know Christ, but we also seek to know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us
Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of that which is lacking of Christ's afflictions for His Body
In Philippians 310 Paul said To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
The mold of Christs death refers to Christs experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God
In other words, when we participate in the death of Christ, we will be molded by His death, being conformed to His death
Paul suffered a great deal of persecution, yet he was confident that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work
Such a deliverance is what we believers should believe in, hope for, and experience, and it is also what the Lord is pleased to give us
Paul suffered because of a thorn in his flesh, and concerning this, he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him
The Lord did not remove the thorn from Paul, but He supplied him with sufficient grace so that he might be able to bear the suffering
It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses
Christ's living in us also enables us to be found in Him, who has become the realm in which we live and our unique expression
He also enables us to enjoy Him as our sufficient grace and overshadowing power, overshadowing us in our weaknesses
It is the converse of the Lord's word in John 15:5 concerning our organic union with Him: 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
By the empowering of the Christ who lives in us we can have a life of contentment, knowing both how to be abased and how to abound
We can live out all kinds of virtues such as being true being dignified being righteous being pure being lovely and being well spoken of
In this way, by the empowering of the indwelling Christ, we are able to live a satisfied life and live Christ as our human virtues
When Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself
We may liken our heart to a house with many rooms, including the rooms of the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience
As God's cultivated land, we need to be rooted for growth, and as God's building, we need to be grounded for our building up
Our being rooted and grounded is a matter concerning life and building, indicating that we believers experience Christ for life and building
By such a divine dispensing, we are being rooted and grounded in His love, and spontaneously there will be life and building
The love in which we are rooted and grounded is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way
Ephesians 3:18 says that we 'may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are'
In this way, we, being rooted and grounded in Christ's love, are full of strength to apprehend the dimensions of Christ
Since we have Christ living in us, we are enabled in our spirit to know the love of Christ through our experience and enjoyment of Him
Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience and enjoy adequately
To be filled unto the fullness of God is the issue of the believers' deeper, higher, and richer experience of Christ
The last aspect of our enjoyment and experience of Christ living in us in the grace of the Triune God is that we may be built up in Him
Since we have been rooted in Christ, we need to remain in our spirit to absorb the nourishment of the riches of Christ that we may grow
When we experience and enjoy Christ living in us in the grace of the Triune God, He enables us to do all things in Him who empowers us
By this we can grow and be transformed into precious stones for the building of the church, the Body of Christ
Corinthians 13:14 speaks of 'the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit'
When we have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we can experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
John 161215 also indicates that the Spirit dwells in us to glorify Christ by revealing Christ to us that Christ may become the reality in us
The Spirit is also the Spirit of God , who is God reaching us and being applied to us for our experience and enjoyment
The Spirit is the Lord Spirit ; this strongly proves and confirms that the Spirit is the Lord Christ and the Lord Christ is the Spirit
The Spirit is the lifegiving Spirit in resurrection Christ became such a Spirit with a spiritual body ready to be received by His believers
The Spirit is also the seven Spirits , the sevenfold intensified Spirit, to strengthen the church in the time of degradation
As long as a particular life exists and is free, it can naturally develop its characteristics and manifest its abilities
Life is the contents and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God
Romans 8:11 says, 'The Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you will also give life to your mortal bodies'
Now that we have Christ in us, though our body without is dead because of sin, our spirit within is life because of righteousness
In our spirit is Christ the Spirit as righteousness, resulting in life; but in our flesh is Satan as sin, resulting in death
Romans 8 shows us that, first, through regeneration the Spirit enters into our spirit and causes our spirit to become life
Lastly, the Spirit dispenses life even to our mortal body and causes the body of sin to become the body of life
We feel peaceful within and the Spirit of the Triune God can make His home in us and have adequate room to settle down in us
On one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us
On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit
These practices include not only sinful things but also all things practiced by our body apart from the Spirit
In order to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit
In the fellowship of the Triune God we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity
If we walk according to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life will set us free continuously
The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, lodging, and musical instruments
In using this expression Paul likened the supply of the Spirit, which is so bountiful, to the supply of the choragus
Although Paul was imprisoned, the imprisonment did not isolate him from the Body of Christ or cut him off from the supply of the Body
We also must be joined to the Body of Christ today that we may enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit which is for the Body
The leading here is not merely an action of the Spirit; it is the Triune God Himself becoming the leading in our spirit
The leading by the Spirit is not outward but inward, and is composed of the law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit, and life
We must take Him as our life and everything and that we must put to death everything of the old creation in us
We do not need to seek after the Spirit's leading, since it is already present within us, that is, in our regenerated spirit
Not only have they been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they are also walking by being led by the Spirit
We may be God's children, but we do not have the growth that comes by living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit in life
By these three stages of the Spirit's sanctification, God's salvation is applied to us that we may obtain and enjoy it fully
Thessalonians 2:13 says, 'God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth'
Romans 15:16 says, 'That the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit'
It is not an outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward replacing of the old element with the new element
As the Lord Spirit works to transform us by the divine dispensing, He causes a metabolic, organic change to take place in our whole being
Transformation is the changing aspect of sanctification, and sanctification is the separating aspect of transformation
Sanctification and transformation go together: Transformation depends on sanctification, and sanctification works for transformation
Romans 8:9 and 11 say, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
Corinthians 3:16 says, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you'?
6:19 says, 'Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own'?
Both kinds of temples are for the Spirit's indwelling so that He may dispense the Triune God into us individually and corporately
He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased without limit
It is by this Spirit, who witnesses with our spirit, that we are children of God and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us
The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God
Acts 6:3 says, 'Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need'
By this we see that the inward filling of the Spirit is not for work or for ministry but for our existence and living
In Matthew 10:16-33 the Lord Jesus speaks to the twelve apostles concerning persecution and the way to meet it
We should face opposition and confront attack not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit dwells
Through the Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, the reality of the Divine Trinity is transmitted into us
All the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has are dispensed into us to be our element and essence
Corinthians 2:10 says, 'But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
God in His wisdom has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken
On the one hand, it refers to the spiritual things themselves; on the other hand, it refers to spiritual words
Spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God
When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God, the Spirit will also teach us spiritual words for the interpretation of spiritual things
When the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of Jehovah came to them and then was spoken forth through them
In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul's teaching is based on the principle of incarnation, that God speaks in man's speaking
The Spirit in us also fills us essentially to dispense the Divine Trinity into us for our existence and living
He works in us to such an extent that we may be absolutely one with Him that He may speak with us in our speaking
When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God, He dispenses Himself into us that we may be comforted and encouraged by the Spirit
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Thessalonians 1:6 also tells us that the believers 'received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
If we are righteous and right toward others and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God
The indwelling Lord is the cause of our rejoicing, and the Holy Spirit who moves within us is the motivation of our constant rejoicing
If we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and experience and enjoy the Spirit, we will have the joy that is brought to us by the Spirit
Romans 5:5 says, 'The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us'
From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit
Christ died for ungodly sinners such as we and shed His blood on the cross to redeem us and reconcile us to God
As long as we have this mingled spirit, we will have faith and the boldness to speak to others about our experience of Christ
The indwelling Spirit is the means for God the Father to strengthen us into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
According to the context of chapter five, the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit
The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God
, to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step; and, derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner
If we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and take the Spirit as our essence and our way, we will surely reach the goal
Galatians 5:17 says, 'The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other'
The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God's purpose
If we are in ourselves, we will not be able to defeat the flesh; rather, we will be taken captive by the flesh
He will fight for us against the flesh that we may be delivered from the works of the flesh and live and walk by the Spirit
The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations
It has more expressions, such as lowliness , compassion , godliness , righteousness , holiness , purity , and other virtues
The natural virtues do not have anything of the Spirit, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit
We need simply to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, and then the fruit of the Spirit will be brought forth automatically
Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: 'The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy''?
For this reason, the Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself only
The Spirit works in this way also to dispense into us the Triune God as the unique element that we may be sanctified and transformed
If we are righteous and right toward others and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God
In this spirit we have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection
Christ makes His home in our hearts to control our entire inward being and supply and strengthen every inward part with Himself
By Him we have not only a general, daily walk, but also a walk that takes God's unique goal as the direction and purpose of life
The Spirit also fights for us against the flesh that we may be delivered from the works of the flesh and live and walk by the Spirit
He also bears the fruit of life in many aspects in our life, such as love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, and goodness
The Spirit is the sword for us to fight against our spiritual enemies, the power of darkness, and the evil things
When the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word, this word is the Spirit, who is the sword for slaying the enemy
By praying and taking the word of God in this way, we enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting to slay all the things that resist us
If we take Christ as reality and have Christ as grace, we will make the Holy Spirit happy, and He will give us joy
Of grieving, quenching, or insulting the Spirit, we should experience and enjoy Him positively as the consummation of the Triune God
Jude 20 says, 'But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit'
When we pray by this element and in this sphere, we experience and enjoy the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God
On the foundation of this holy faith, and in the sphere of it, by praying in the Holy Spirit, we build up ourselves
The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit enjoyed through our prayer are necessary for our building up
Romans 8:27 says, 'He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God'
As we do not know how to pray concerning the growth in life, we groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting the divine sonship
In 2 Timothy 1:14 Paul charged Timothy, saying, 'Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us'
God's life, God's Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord's recovery have been deposited into our being
To sow unto the flesh is to sow for one's own flesh, with the desire and purpose of the flesh in view, to fulfill what the flesh covets
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires
Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself
To sow unto the flesh is to have the flesh as the goal, but to sow unto the Spirit is to have the Spirit as our goal
John 4:2 says, 'In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God'
In our fellowship with the Divine Trinity the Third the Spirit confesses testifies that the Second who is the Lord Jesus is still a man
By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us, that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name
The Spirit is the sword for us to fight against our spiritual enemies, the power of darkness, and the evil things
When we receive the word of God by means of all prayer, we enjoy the Spirit as the sword for slaying all the things that resist us
By the Spirit here is in contrast to by the flesh , and out of faith is in contrast to out of the works of law
Now in the divine fellowship, through the Spirit and by faith we have Christ as the righteousness that we live out daily
It is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also; rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit
The indwelling Spirit's witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is a matter of the divine fellowship
The Spirit not only witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God but also cries with our spirit, 'Abba, Father'!
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Sonship in this spirit includes the life the position the living the enjoyment the birthright the inheritance and the manifestation of a son
Such a Spirit with the allinclusive sonship which is also the Spirit of Gods Son is now in our spirit and cries with our spirit Abba Father!
Such a crying expresses our strong affection to the Father; it also implies an intimate relationship in life between us and God our Father
When we are in the fellowship of the Triune God, the Spirit brings us into the enjoyment and experience of such sweetness and intimacy
It says that our conscience bears witness with us in the Holy Spirit, whereas Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit
When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and speak walk and behave by the Spirit the Spirit bears witness with us in our conscience
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God
Corinthians 5:5 says, 'He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge'
There will be a harvest of this blessing at the redemption of our body; that will be our full enjoyment of God
The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son
He assures us that we have God's life and restricts us to walk according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God
Through the redemption of Christ and in one Spirit we have access to the Father to draw near to Him and enjoy Him
God called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we might become partakers of His Holy Spirit and share in His Holy Spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit, and we also keep the oneness of the Body of Christ
They were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath
By the Holy Spirit's making clear, we know that the way of the Holy of Holies had not yet been manifested in the Old Testament
The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant
We should enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, our spirit, to draw near to God and enjoy Him as love, light, and every divine thing
Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
The believers having believed into Christ and having been baptized into His name that is into Himself are in Christ and are one with Him
When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings
When we are reproached and suffer persecution in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory rests upon us and remains with us
Timothy 3:16 says, 'Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness:/He who was manifested in the flesh,/Justified in the Spirit'
The transition from the mystery of godliness to He implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Whatever the Father is, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives become our portion for our experience and enjoyment
The Spirit is also the fellowship of the Triune God to us, transmitting the Lord with God into us for our full enjoyment of the Triune God
He rests upon us as the glory when we are reproached, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection to be the Spirit of life essentially
The inward filling Spirit the essential Spirit is in the believers whereas the outward filling Spirit the economical Spirit is upon them
In experience, we receive the baptism in the Spirit at different times and in different places-each at his own time and in his own place
They did not have just that one experience, but later still continued to have experiences of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit
We all need to see this glorious fact and remove all causes and hindrances that prevent us from experiencing this fact
The apostles became ministers of the new covenant not by human knowledge or natural effort but by the Spirit as the constituting element
Within this Spirit there are many divine elements, which not only transform us but also constitute us the new covenant ministers
The ministry of the Spirit is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life
It is a matter of spiritual constitution, a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths
We need to experience the divine life and know the divine truths by the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God
In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 8 Paul presents a strong contrast between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit
The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death; the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit
In every aspect and in every way the New Testament ministry dispenses Christ into us as the life-giving Spirit
The tongues of fire here are a symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God's economical Spirit of power is mostly for speaking
Today we, through the all-inclusive Spirit, need to testify of and preach the Christ who is in His resurrection and exaltation
Thessalonians 1:5 says, 'Our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit'
We see that the gospel preached by the apostles was preached not only in word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit
No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, 'Jesus is accursed'; he would like to say, and he is able to say, 'Jesus is Lord'!
The Spirit is with us in two aspects: He is in us as the Spirit of life essentially, and He is upon us as the Spirit of power economically
The Spirit's coming upon us as power is for us to have Him as the power, authority, ability, and capacity of our work for the Lord on earth
As the divine element is being dispensed into us by the Spirit, He works in us to transform us and constitute us the new covenant ministers
It is a matter of spiritual constitution, a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths
The Spirit in us also witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ that we may witness outwardly for Christ
As we preach the word of the Lord, the Spirit demonstrates Himself with power in our preaching that people may be subdued
Philip, beginning from the Scripture which the eunuch was reading, preached Jesus as the gospel to him, and he believed and was baptized
While Peter was in Joppa, praying on the housetop of the house of Simon, a tanner, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision
And while Peter was pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, there are three men seeking you
Peter went with them to the house of Cornelius as directed by the Spirit and preached the gospel to the Gentiles
In the case of the disciples entreating Paul not to go up to Jerusalem, we can also see the Spirit's direction
In the same way, today we should experience and enjoy the Spirit to act, walk, work, and serve according to the direction of the Spirit
One of them named Agabus rose up and signified through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth'
The portions of the Word mentioned above show us that the Spirit tells us, either directly or indirectly, the things to come
Today, in like manner, the Spirit works in us and on us to gain us that He may send us out to preach the gospel of Christ to others
That was a unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem
Acts 16:6 says, 'They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia'
Acts 16:7 continues, 'When they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
In Acts 16:6-7 the interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit
By forbidding and not allowing the Spirit led the apostles enabling them to carry out the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ
Here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing, said that it was the Holy Spirit who did the placing of the elders
Those who establish the elders in the churches must do so by following the leading and establishing of the indwelling Spirit in them
In this way the arrangement of the eldership will be perfected in the church according to the leading and direction of the Holy Spirit
These gifts, which are obtained through the Spirit, enable the believers to do spiritual things and manifest their spiritual function
Just as we have human abilities and capacities because we have human life, we also have spiritual gifts because we have the divine life
All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit in that the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts
Among them, there is the word of wisdom, the word that concerns Christ as the deeper things of God, predestined by God to be our portion
There is also the word of knowledge, the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord
There is faith, like the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24
There is the discerning of spirits, which is to distinguish the Spirit that is out of God from those spirits that are not out of God
Finally, there is the interpretation of tongues, referring to the gift to make the unknown tongues known, understandable
Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is more than nine items
Of these gifts prophecy as prediction faith gifts of healing works of power speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are miraculous
Corinthians 12:11 says, 'The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes'
The lifegiving Spirit works within us to cause us to have the manifestation of gifts and thus make us proper functioning members in the Body
Every church should give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches
Whether in our living, in our actions, in our work, or in our preaching of the gospel, the Spirit always gives us definite directions
Sometimes the Spirit also serves as the means for us to predict something that we may be able to foretell future happenings
The Spirit also tells us the things to come, either by speaking to us directly or by speaking to us through the members indirectly
The Spirit also warns us not to repeat the history of the failure of Israel that we may not miss the rest that God has prepared for us
