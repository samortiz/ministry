<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE FURTHERANCE OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:5-6, 12, 18-20, 27</h1><p>In the books written by the apostle Paul, only Philippians speaks in a particular way concerning the preaching of the gospel. Philippians 1:5 says, “For your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now.” Paul opens this book with his prayer in which he joyfully thanks the Lord that the Philippians are in the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel. Here the apostle used the word fellowship instead of preaching. This is very meaningful. To speak merely of the preaching of the gospel is a little shallow, but to speak of the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel is very deep. We Christians today may not know clearly what it means to have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel.<p>Many Bible students recognize that the church in Philippi was a church that preached the gospel. The apostle Paul prayed for them that their fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel might be carried on to work out God’s purpose. In verse 6 he continues, “Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.” Through this prayer we can realize that God’s intention is that a local church would have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel, not only for one period of time but continually, until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, until He comes back. In reading this word we can also realize that the apostle was burdened that this fellowship would not be interrupted. Therefore, he said he was confident that He who had begun in them a good work would complete it until the day of His coming back. By this we can see that there is a real battle. God’s intention is to have the local churches in the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel, but there is the possibility that this fellowship, which is a good work begun by the Lord Himself, might be interrupted. I have the sense and the burden that it is right to apply this word to us. A good work has begun among us, but there is the possibility that it will be interrupted; it may be stopped. Therefore, we have to pray that the Lord will keep this work going on and on until the day of His coming back.<p>Paul told the Philippians that his imprisonment would also work to the advancement of the gospel. Verses 12 and 18 say, “Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel.…What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice.” Even his being in prison was a kind of furtherance of the gospel.<p>He also said that while he was imprisoned, he had the desire, the burden, to magnify Christ. Verse 20 says, “According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.” This tells us that the genuine preaching of the gospel is not merely the preaching of the word, but a life of magnifying Christ.<p>Then at the end of this chapter, he tells us that we must have a kind of conduct, a daily walk and living, that becomes the gospel of Christ. Verse 27a says, “Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you.” We must have a life, a conversation, a walk, which corresponds with our gospel. Then verse 27b says, “That you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.” The word strive here means to labor, to fight. We have to labor, fight, and strive together. The word together is also very meaningful, having the sense of “as one man, shoulder to shoulder in absolute cooperation.” This requires that we be in one spirit and with one mind.
