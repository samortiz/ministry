<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SON OF GOD<br />
TO ARRIVE AT THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE<br />
OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for...the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Verse 13 speaks of knowing the Son of God, and it refers to experiencing Christ as life practically. Such experiences result in our arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This verse does not speak of arriving at the measure of the stature of the Son of God through the knowledge of Christ but of arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ through the knowledge of the Son of God. According to the Gospel and the Epistles of John, <em>the Son of God</em> speaks of God being our life in His Son.</p>
<p>The title <em>Christ</em> refers mainly to God&rsquo;s anointing, and it emphasizes God&rsquo;s sending of His Son to accomplish His work. The term <em>Son of God</em> speaks of life. To have the knowledge of the Son of God means to live by Christ as our life and to be full of life. To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ means to become useful persons in God&rsquo;s hand, to become persons anointed and sent by God to accomplish His will. Living by the Son of God as life is to know the Son of God. Manifesting our function outwardly is related to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Stature comes from life, and stature manifests function. The more we know the Son of God and live by Christ as our life, the more we will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and the function that comes from Christ.</p>
<p>As a child grows in stature, he is able to accomplish certain things, and the fuller his stature is, the more he will be able to accomplish. Function is absolutely related to stature. We cannot expect a child to do much, because he is lacking in stature. In contrast, the function of a brother as an elder in his care for the saints will manifest a much greater stature. The more he grows in life, the more he will manifest the stature of Christ, that is, the stature of the Anointed, the stature of the sent One. His stature and the measure of his function will come from knowing the Son of God, from growing in Christ as life.</p>
<p>Some brothers seem to be able to coordinate, but they do not manifest much function. This means that they may not be functioning according to the life of the Son, because their coordination does not cause them to grow or manifest the stature of Christ. If we live by the life of the Son, our coordination will have a stature and manifest the measure of our function.</p>
<p>Thus, we must see that if we are to be built by God, we not only need to go through the outer court, in order to be judged by God and to be clothed in fine linen to experience God as our righteousness (cf. Exo. 27:1 and footnotes 1 and 2; v. 9 and footnote 2, Recovery Version). We also must enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience wood being overlaid with gold, that is, man being mingled with God. We should not regard this matter merely as a doctrine that we should know or teach; we must experience this matter. In our living we must not only deal with our mistakes and transgressions but also learn to live not by our life but by Christ as our life. The more we learn this lesson, the more we can coordinate with God&rsquo;s children and enable Christ&rsquo;s stature in us and our stature in Christ to grow. The extent of our stature is the extent of our function. Function comes from stature, and stature comes from the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN NEEDING TO BE REDEEMED<br />
IN ORDER TO BE MINGLED WITH GOD</h2>
<p>The building of God is the mingling of God with man; hence, there is a need for God to redeem man in order to be man&rsquo;s life. God created man so that man would be a vessel to contain Him, but before God could attain His heart&rsquo;s desire, man fell. When man fell, he had a record of sins before God. Furthermore, humanity was utterly corrupted. Man&rsquo;s body, soul, and even spirit were corrupted and damaged. Satan poisoned the soul of man&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and damaged the function of man&rsquo;s intuition and fellowship in his spirit. Such a fallen and corrupted man could not be mingled with God. Therefore, as Genesis 3 records, once man fell, Jehovah placed the cherubim and a flaming sword, which turned in every direction, to guard the way to the tree of life so that no man with sin could contact God&rsquo;s eternal life (v. 24).</p>
<p>However, God prepared redemption for man. God&rsquo;s redemption not only wipes out man&rsquo;s record of sins before God, solving the problem of his sinful deeds; it opens the way for the fallen man to be recovered back to God&rsquo;s intention for man to be a vessel to contain Him. God wants to save our spirit, soul, and body. God&rsquo;s recovery, His full salvation, is through regeneration and renewing. This is different from the human cultivation and improvement that is spoken of by the Chinese sages. God has regenerated us in our spirit and is renewing us in our soul. God is spreading outward from our spirit to renew our soul. He can be mingled only with a renewed man. If we do not let God renew our mind but instead hold on to stale concepts, God cannot be mingled with us in our mind. If we do not let God renew our emotions but instead hold on to our old emotions, He cannot be mingled with us in our emotions. If a considerable part of our being remains in a fallen condition, God cannot be mingled fully with us, because He can be mingled only with a man who has been redeemed and who is being renewed.</p>
<p>In the Holy Place the wood that is overlaid with gold is not rotten or withered wood but proper acacia wood. God wants to be mingled with man, but not with man in an old and rotten condition, like rotten or withered wood, but with man in a proper and renewed condition, like acacia wood.</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to take part in God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s tabernacle, we first must be redeemed so that our record of sins can be judged before God. Although we are created men, we have also been redeemed, having passed through the altar and the laver. We have been shined upon, reproved, condemned, judged, and washed by God. Such a dealing enables us to be in His presence. Now we can go forward into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as life and to experience being overlaid with gold, being mingled with God. As those who are being mingled with God, we are like acacia wood being overlaid with gold. If parts of our being are still in a fallen condition, God cannot be fully mingled with us. God has redeemed every part of our being, but there is still a further need for renewing in order to be fully mingled with Him.</p>
<p>From God&rsquo;s perspective, He is life in His Son in order to grow in us unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so that we may become functioning members. From our perspective, we can experience God being mingled with us because of His multifaceted redemption and salvation. We need to become fine linen and acacia wood that is being overlaid with gold by experiencing Christ as our life to grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Thus, we will not only be built into the Body of Christ but also become functioning and ministering members.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see the deep thought in the picture of the tabernacle. Our person must be one of acacia wood being overlaid with gold, and our condition must be one of fine linen. The function of our mind, emotion, and will in our soul and the function of our intuition, conscience, and fellowship in our spirit must be pure. We need to be renewed by God so that we are not just speaking about building or talking about coordination. We need God&rsquo;s mercy to see our condition according to the light that He has unveiled in this picture of the tabernacle so that we may experience the reality of building and coordination. I hope that we will go step by step in our experience from the outer court into the Holy of Holies so that God would build us step by step.</p>
