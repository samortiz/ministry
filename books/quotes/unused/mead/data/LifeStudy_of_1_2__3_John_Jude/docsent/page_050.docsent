   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE SIXTEEN CONDITIONS OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP 8 Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider 2:3-6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that 2:1 and 2 are a conclusion to the word in 1:5-10 regarding our confession and God s forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Confessing our sins is the first condition of our enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 2:3-11, the second condition is that we keep the Lord s word and love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A SIGN INDICATING THAT WE ARE IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2:5 John says, But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this we know that we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words in this in the last sentence refer to the matter of keeping the Lord s word and having the love of God perfected in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The phrase in Him refers to our being in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a strong expression, for it emphasizes the fact that we are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we read the context of these verses, we shall realize that it is an important matter to have a sign indicating that we are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we prove that we are in the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the evidence that we are truly in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first sign that we are in Him is that we know God experientially in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When John speaks of knowing God v. 3 , he speaks of knowing Him not doctrinally but experientially, by keeping His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not merely know in a doctrinal way that God is almighty and that He created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to know God experientially in a way that affects our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others may wonder why you do not participate in certain forms of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason that you do not participate should be that you know God, that you know Him in His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because God s holy nature does not allow you to participate in that form of entertainment, you refrain from doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, if we know God in His nature, this will affect the way we do our shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knowing God in this way will also cause us to be sincere in relation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because we know the Lord in His nature of sincerity, we would not be political.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the reason we behave ourselves and have our being in a particular way should not be merely that we follow the outward teachings of the Bible, but even the more that we know God s nature and character and live according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes others may try to convince you that there is no need for you to be so strict in your living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may tell you, for example, that there is nothing wrong with spending some time engaging in a certain kind of amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may wish to answer them by saying, I do not view this as a matter of right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My testimony is that I know my God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have a living God dwelling within me, and I am in Him and one with Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that His nature becomes mine and what He is becomes my constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, I know Him subjectively and experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason I cannot conduct myself in the same way others do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unbelievers do not have Him, and, of course, they do not know Him or experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you know why I behave in the way I do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is because I have Him, know Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord is not only my life He is everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not live according to certain regulations or requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a matter of the divine life within me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord dwells in me, and I know Him experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE TASTE OF THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be in the Lord Jesus Christ is to be one with Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not to be one with Him merely in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are organically one with the Lord, He is our life and even becomes our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every kind of life has its particular nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the nature of the divine life there is a certain taste.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we have the Lord as our life and because we enjoy His nature, we also have the taste that comes with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, anyone who does not have the divine nature cannot have the divine taste.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But because we have the taste of the divine nature, we simply cannot do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As an illustration of what we mean by the taste of the divine nature, we may consider what happens when something with a bitter taste is placed in the mouth of a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to teach the young one not to eat something bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as a bitter-tasting substance is placed in a baby s mouth, he will spit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The child does not behave according to regulations learned from his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need for a mother to teach her baby not to eat things that are bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the life of her child there is a nature that rejects things that taste bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a similar way, there is in the divine nature a particular taste that causes us to reject those things that are contrary to the nature of the One who lives within us.</S>
