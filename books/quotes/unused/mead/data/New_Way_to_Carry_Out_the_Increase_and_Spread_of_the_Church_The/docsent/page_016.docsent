   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to the Spirit s Leading</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Practical Situation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To pray or not to pray before one speaks makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must pray before you go out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without enough prayer, you should not go out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Get yourself qualified by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the Lord will be sovereign in leading you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We surely have to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To follow the Spirit, the basic principle is to drop our own things, our personal things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not do anything on our own, but do everything according to the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proper way for the church to carry out this new way for the Lord s spread is that the elders must take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is absolutely different from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past the saints did things, and the elders were just giving directions or orders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But now the elders must realize that they should knock on doors much more than the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the elders to merely sit in the church office is not a real profit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A real profit for the church is that the elders would go out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This corresponds to the biblical principle concerning the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should take the lead not to rule over the saints or to give commands or instructions, telling people to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders should take the lead by doing it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then all the others will follow 1 Pet 5:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, all the leading ones, the elders, should bear the responsibility to form the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The teams have to be formed through the elders arrangement, not just by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This may seemingly contradict the points I told you concerning going out according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may feel that to go out according to the Spirit is one thing, and to go out by the elders forming the teams is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible gives us the principle, however, that if there is no church you should follow the Spirit according to the situation; but if there is a church, you must follow the Spirit through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Philip was a good model.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He followed the Spirit directly in Acts 8 because at that juncture there was no church where he was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus did not go out on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Five brothers were praying who were in the church at Antioch Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those five brothers were the living and acting members of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They represented the church at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They prayed together and received the Holy Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this we can see that if there is a church, we have to receive the leading of the Spirit through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not here in an independent way, but we are here living the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not you individually taking this new way, but the church corporately taking this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders are the leading ones in this matter, so they must bear the responsibility to form the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the need of some human way under the guiding of the Spirit to form the teams properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to our experience, one team should not exceed four persons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you had seven persons going out to visit a family, the family would be apprehensive, to say the least.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, it would be hard for them to receive you all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best number is three.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Always try to have one older person, one younger person, and one middle-aged person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do the best to form the teams in this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If three young men go out to knock on one door, some people may be afraid that you are coming to rob them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For three girls to go out together by themselves is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is neither wise for three older brothers or three older sisters to go out as a team.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A good team could be composed of an older sister, one younger sister, and a middle-aged brother or of one older brother, one younger brother, and one middle-aged sister.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every team must have a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brother will be for baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that sisters can baptize people, so the brothers have to bear the burden to baptize.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone has to learn not to do anything on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to go out to do a proper job, and this proper job includes one thing to baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the teams, it is best to have one brother matched by two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes two brothers could be matched with one sister.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the elders form the teams, they should also have the following point in their consideration of the three, one must be at least a little stronger in life and in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A good number of the saints would not dare to stand up to say anything in a meeting, but in a small group going out to visit other people, they may all like to take the lead in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a visiting group, only one should be the main speaker, and the other two should learn how to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The elders should do something to train the saints in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You cannot collect five people and expect them to work together as a basketball team without any coaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you pass the basketball to them, they will not know how to play.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is the need of some amount of training.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What I am giving you are some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that the elders would take these principles and put them into practice to train all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A certain group could be composed of an older brother, a middle-aged sister, and a younger sister who is only sixteen or seventeen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In life, in spirit, and even in knowing the Word, this younger sister may be stronger than the older brother and the middle-aged sister.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, they should let the young sister take the lead to open her mouth to talk to people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the elders arrange the teams, they should realize that the proper speaking person should be this younger sister.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The younger sister should be bold, the older brother should give in, and the middle-aged sister should understand the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When this young sister makes a deal for baptism, the older brother should be ready to baptize, and the middle-aged sister should also be very strong to urge the wife of the household to fill up the bathtub with water.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to the Spirit s leading, the elders need to consider the practical and particular situation of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First, the ones who form a team need a car, so among these three there must be one who has a car.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Three persons going out will only need one car to travel in. If none of the three has a car, the elders should rearrange the group so that one person in the group has a car.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is also better to put three into one team from the same vicinity so they can go out together easily.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They will not need to wait for someone else from another neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Also, the elders have to consider the functions of the ones in the group.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One of them may have a car, and they all may be in the same neighborhood, yet each one of them may not be skilled in speaking to others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Based upon this, they could not be formed into a team.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The elders need to realize that it is not an easy thing to put these principles into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is the need of much labor on the part of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The saints need to forget their considerations regarding the formation of the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No one should have the freedom to choose with whom they will go because the elders will form the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Furthermore, to set a time for all the teams to come together to pray in the meeting hall is awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This means that they will all have to travel to the meeting hall and will have to wait for latecomers.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This practice will kill the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Let every team in their own place pray, and let them make a decision as to the proper and profitable time for them to go out to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This will save time and travel.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But what the elders should charge each team to do before going out, is to have at least fifteen minutes to pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You must have a time to pray yourself into the spirit, to pray to have the impact, to pray to have the faith with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All of the teams should pray, but there is no need for all of the teams to come together for this.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not consider my fellowship as commandments that I am giving you.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is a leading composed of principles.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I am not in your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When you practice, you will find that some aspects should be adjusted in your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>To go out to spread the gospel with the truth is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our going will open the door for the Lord to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No one can tell how far the Lord will go.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are still studying our situation and putting the results of this study into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You must learn to do things in a new and living way, dropping your old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In doing anything, do not keep the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Try the best to get some new way to improve what you are doing.</S>
