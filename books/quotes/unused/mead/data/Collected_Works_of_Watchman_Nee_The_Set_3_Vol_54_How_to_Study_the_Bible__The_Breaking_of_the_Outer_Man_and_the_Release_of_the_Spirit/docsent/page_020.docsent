   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Lord Falling Asleep in the Boat</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 8:23-27 speaks of the instance when the Lord Jesus crossed the sea with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suddenly a great tempest rose up in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord was asleep, and the disciples were afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew's record the disciples said, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" v. 25 . But Mark 4:38 has something more to say: "Teacher, does it not matter to You...?" That means that they questioned how He could sleep so soundly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, and they were stilled; then He turned and rebuked the disciples for their little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice the order of events according to Mark and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the Lord rebuked the disciples, He rebuked the wind and the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord had a basis for rebuking the disciples because He had said that He would cross to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since He had said it, it must be so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was no need to worry even if there were winds, waves, or whatever along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus was teaching them the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What were they putting their faith in?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should have trusted in the Lord's word: "Let us go over to the other side" Mark 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the Lord having said that they would go over to the other side, it was not possible for them to end up at the bottom of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet the disciples did not have faith in this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason the Lord rebuked them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is interesting that we never find the Lord apologizing to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Under normal circumstances, the more lessons a man learns before the Lord, the more he has to apologize to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more disciplined a person is, the more he discovers others' dissatisfaction with him, and the more frequently he will need to apologize to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is unique in that He never had to apologize to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems as if the disciples thought that they were right and the Lord was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The winds and the waves were fierce, and the disciples were perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Did this not matter to the Teacher?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord did not wake up to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The absence of an apology is an expression of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knew that He did not oversleep, and He knew that He was not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He said to cross to the other side, He meant that they would cross to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was not one wasted word in Him, and no one can make Him apologize for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows the glory of our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2 The Touch of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>with the Flow of Blood</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Mark 5 we have the story of the woman with the flow of blood who came to touch the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we find the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the woman touched the Lord, He turned around and asked who had touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The disciples said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" v. 31 . This was said in somewhat a rebuking tone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord did not say, "I am sorry; I asked the wrong question."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, He turned around to see who was touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was, in effect, saying, "Someone is touching Me, but you do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your eyes are on the pressing ones, but My eyes are on the touching one."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Outwardly speaking, the Lord appeared to be wrong; it seemed as if the disciples were justified in their indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in reality the mistake was with the disciples, not with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord never apologized once to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is most glorious, and our heart cannot help but worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3 The Death of Lazarus</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 11 we find another instance of men being dissatisfied with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Martha said to the Lord, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . She was blaming the Lord for arriving late.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She was saying in her heart, "I sent men to ask for You a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why did You not come sooner?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of Your delay, my brother has died and has been buried."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The phrase if You had been here expresses Martha's extreme unhappiness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Apparently, Martha's words were absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the Lord did everything with deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He purposely stayed where He was for two more days v. 6 . In man's eyes this was a delay, but the Lord Jesus purposely delayed His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Lord never apologizes to anyone, because He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We apologize, because we are often wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we refuse to apologize, it means that we are arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more humble and meek we are, the more we will apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although our Lord is humble and meek, He never apologizes, because He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are unhappy with Him, our unhappiness does not make Him feel guilty, for He knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can find many cases like these in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In reading the Bible we have to learn to apply the principle of gathering together all the portions which speak of similar things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From the above three examples, we can discover one glorious fact: The Lord never takes back one word that He has said; He never turns back on a pathway that He has trodden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What a glory this is!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Was it more glorious for Lazarus to be healed or for him to be resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord knew that it was more glorious for Lazarus to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we believe, we will see God's glory.</S>
