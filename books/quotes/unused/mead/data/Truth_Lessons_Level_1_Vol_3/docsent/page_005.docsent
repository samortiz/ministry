   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONDITION UNDER SATAN S HAND A. Being a Child of the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men are not only sinful and corrupt, but they are also out of the Devil Satan and belong to the Devil 1 John 3:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As descendants of fallen Adam, men are born children of the Devil, the evil one John 8:44; 1 John 3:10 , with a life that is mingled with the Devil s life and a nature that is mixed with Satan s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>People lie, sin, walk in lusts, and murder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these are manifestations of the Devil s life and nature, because the life and nature in men which cause them to lie, sin, walk in lusts, and murder are out of the Devil and belong to the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since men are related to the Devil in life and united with him in nature, they are therefore children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Obeying the Ruler of the Authority of the Air</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the fall, men became children of the Devil and were subjected under his authority, obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan directs his angels to rule today in the air over the dark world Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, he has become the evil spirit who operates in the hearts of men Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, he brings people into obedience to him and makes them children of disobedience, opposers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the things that men do to oppose God and all the evil things that men do are the result of Satan s operation in men s hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, man not only has Satan s life and nature but also Satan himself as such an evil spirit operating within him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The Mind Being Blinded</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>by the God of This Age</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, Satan operates in the hearts of men, causing them to do things to oppose God; on the other hand, he blinds their minds, making them unable to know God, unable to see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People think that they are wise, yet little do they know that their minds are manipulated and veiled by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although they understand philosophy and science, they neither comprehend the things of God nor know the salvation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They cannot tell from where they came and to where they are going.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They neither recognize the way they are on nor know the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They walk and live like the blind, and they are altogether in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan is not only the one who controls the world 1 John 5:19b and brings men into obedience to himself, but he is also the god of this age 2 Cor 4:4 who commands people to worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He hides himself behind many persons, matters, and objects, especially idols, to be worshipped by men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, people unconsciously worship Satan when they kneel before idols or when they worship or esteem any person, matter, or object; it is through these things that Satan veils their minds, making it impossible for them to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When their hearts adore such persons, matters, or objects, and their eyes esteem them, their minds are veiled and blinded by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Lying under the Hand of the Evil One</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Men are not only in obedience to Satan and veiled by Satan, but they also lie in the evil one, Satan 1 John 5:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After Satan has blinded the minds of men, he lords it over men, causing them to lie under his hand to be manipulated and slaughtered as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though people struggle to be set free, they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>E. Being under Satan s Authority of Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan has his kingdom Matt 12:26 and his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His kingdom is his authority of darkness Col 1:13; Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fallen men are subjects in his kingdom, ruled and controlled by him under his authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are in a realm where there is neither light nor righteousness, but rather one that is full of darkness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>F. To Enter into the Eternal Fire</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prepared for Satan</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ultimate result of man s being under the hand of Satan is that he will enter with Satan into the eternal fire prepared for Satan Matt 25:41 ; that is, he will enter into the lake of fire Rev 20:15 to be tormented for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since men have joined Satan in sinning against God, they deserve to suffer the penalty of eternal fire with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because people have been following Satan to sin for their whole life, they should accompany Satan to suffer punishment for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since men are walking with Satan, they will arrive at the same destination with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the final result and destiny of the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we have seen the tragic condition of man before God, in himself, and under Satan s hand, we must see and sense how much people need God s deliverance and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Much more, we must be burdened to preach the gospel and save sinners that they may escape the destiny of perdition and may enter into God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the fall of Adam and before receiving God s salvation, the condition of man before God, in himself, and under Satan s hand is pitiful and tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before God men have sinned and are sinful both positionally and experientially; they have fallen under God s judgment and condemnation and have been condemned already; they are under the wrath of God and have become children of wrath; and according to God s ordination, unless they repent, they will enter into death, suffer God s final judgment, perish eternally in the lake of fire, and suffer the penalty of the eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In himself man is brought forth in iniquity, conceived in sin, born a sinner, corrupted in nature, and constituted of sin; his heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, there is nothing good dwelling in his flesh, and he is an enemy of God as well as a son of disobedience; he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge and does not glorify Him nor thank Him, much less worship Him; he is lost and has gone astray, is dead in offenses and sins, and is a slave of sin, controlled and manipulated by sin; and having no hope in this world, he will die in sin, go to Hades in sorrow, and enter into eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Under the hand of Satan men are born children of the evil one, the Devil, being subjected under his authority and obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, having been blinded by Satan in their minds, men cannot see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, and they lie under Satan s hand, under his authority of darkness, to be slaughtered as he pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually men will enter into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil, which is the lake of fire, to suffer torment for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the final result and destiny of the fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these conditions of man reveal his need for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>QUESTIONS Briefly describe the condition of fallen man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Briefly describe the condition of fallen man in himself.</S>
