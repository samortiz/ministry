   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the Lord Himself told the blind man whom He had healed that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the Lord's own word saying that He is the Son of God, has the Godhead, and is equal with God.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as the Father is God, He also is God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, John 13:3 says, Jesus, knowing that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word proves that the Lord and God are one.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus also said, All that the Father has is Mine John 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that all that God is rests in the Lord, as Paul also testified in Colossians 2:9: For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily for He is God as well as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's prayer to the Father on the last night of His stay on earth was, And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was John 17:5 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In stating, But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God John 20:31 , John declares that his entire Gospel was written in order to prove that the Lord is the Son of God He is the same as God, having God's nature and Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Acts also says the Lord is Lord 2:36; 9:5; 10:36 as well as the Son of God 9:20; 13:33 .</S>
