<h2 class="head2">B. The Redemption in the New Testament</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Propitiation</h2><p>The expiation in the Old Testament was a type of the propitiation in the New Testament. Propitiation is mentioned at least five times in the New Testament. In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 we are told that Christ, the Son of God, is Himself the propitiation for our sins. In both places the word propitiation actually means a sacrifice and should be rendered &ldquo;propitiatory sacrifice.&rdquo; The Greek word in these verses is <i>hilasmos,</i> which means &ldquo;that which propitiates,&rdquo; that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. Another Greek word regarding propitiation, <i>hilasterion,</i> is found in Hebrews 9:5 and Romans 3:25. <i>Hilasterion</i> means the place where propitiation was made. The proper reference books indicate that the word <i>hilasterion</i> in these two verses means the place of propitiation, and the King James Version renders it as &ldquo;mercy seat.&rdquo; In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, <i>hilasterion</i> is the word for the term &ldquo;mercy seat&rdquo; in Exodus 25 and Leviticus 16. Thus, <i>hilasterion</i> is the place of propitiation. Furthermore, in Hebrews 2:17 is the word <i>hilaskomai,</i> the verbal form of the noun <i>hilasmos.</i> The King James Version translates <i>hilaskomai</i> as &ldquo;make reconciliation for&rdquo;; however, it should be translated &ldquo;propitiate.&rdquo; Christ propitiates for our sins. The matter of propitiation is mentioned five times in the New Testament in relation to Christ: twice it refers to Christ Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice, twice it refers to the place where propitiation was accomplished, and once it refers to the action of propitiation.</p><p>In addition to these five references to propitiation in the New Testament, we find the same root used by the publican in his prayer in the temple (Luke 18:13). According to the King James Version, the publican prayed, &ldquo;God, be merciful to me.&rdquo; However, the Greek means, &ldquo;Propitiate for me.&rdquo; The publican actually was saying, &ldquo;O God, propitiate for me. I am sinful in Your eyes. I need propitiation.&rdquo;</p><p>What is the meaning of propitiation? How shall we distinguish it from redemption on the one hand and reconciliation on the other? If we read the New Testament carefully, we will discover that reconciliation includes propitiation. Nevertheless, there is a difference between them. Propitiation means that you have a problem with another person. You have either offended him or else you owe him something. For instance, if I wrong you or am otherwise in debt to you, a problem exists between us. Because of this problem or debt, you have a demand upon me, and unless your demand is satisfied the problem between us cannot be resolved. Thus, there is the need for propitiation.</p><p>The Greek word <i>hilasmos</i> implies that I have wronged you and that now I am indebted to you. There is a problem between us that hinders our relationship. Propitiation, therefore, involves two parties, one of which has wronged the other, has become indebted to the other, and must act to satisfy the demands of the other. If the offending party is to appease the offended party, he must fulfill his demands. The Septuagint uses the word hilasmos for the word atonement in Leviticus 25:9 and Numbers 5:8 because this Greek word means to conciliate two parties and make them one. This is a matter of atonement.</p><p>The word atone is composed of two words, &ldquo;at&rdquo; and &ldquo;one.&rdquo; We may write the word atonement this way: at-one-ment. Atonement is at-one-ment. The meaning of atonement is to bring two parties into one. When two parties have been separated and seek to be in oneness, there is the need for propitiation. This is atonement. The action of propitiation is atonement. Propitiation means to make us one with God because there had been a separation between us and God. What was the problem that kept us from God, that made it impossible to have direct fellowship with Him? The problem was our sins. Our sins kept us away from God&rsquo;s presence and hindered God from coming to us. Therefore, we needed propitiation to appease God&rsquo;s demands. Christ accomplished this on the cross when He offered Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice. On the cross He propitiated for us and brought us back to God, making us one with God.</p>
