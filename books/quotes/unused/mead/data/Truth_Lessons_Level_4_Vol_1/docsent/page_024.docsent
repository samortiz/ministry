   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many prophecies in Psalms 22, 34, 40, and 69 concerning Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these psalms, David the psalmist typifies the suffering Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When people were mocking Him and deriding Him, He was trusting in God, because He had trusted in God even while He was at His mother s breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though He intended to die, He trusted in God continually, believing that God would deliver Him, that is, cause Him to be resurrected from the dead.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All who saw Him derided Him, sneered at Him, shook their heads, saying, He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To reproach is to shame, to despise is to look down on with contempt and scorn, to deride is to make fun of or laugh at in contempt, and to sneer is to smile or laugh at with facial contortions that express scorn or contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After being questioned by Pilate, the Lord was further made fun of by the Roman soldiers: They wove a crown of thorns and placed it on His head and put a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews!</S>
