   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM WENCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Yueh Chiao:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter on the evening of the eleventh and learned of your charge to me to preach the gospel to Mr. Chin Tao Pen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That evening I gave the brothers and sisters the responsibility to pray and ask the Lord concerning His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the prayer meeting on the nineteenth, the brothers decided to go to preach the gospel to him that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord, before we got up to leave, he came into our meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that he had received a letter from Sister Chin Mr. Chin's aunt at 6:00 p.m. that evening, asking him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He left his house at 6:20 p.m. and did not find the place until 8:00 p.m. A few brothers and I preached the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank and praise the Lord, His Spirit began to work in him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He confessed his sins and received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He came to the Lord's Day afternoon meeting the next day and to the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Last Lord's Day afternoon he also came to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the meeting, two brothers and I went to his place to talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He declared that he was saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see that he has really gained life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has honestly repented and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said that in August and September of last year, he went out every night to gamble, drink, and do all sorts of evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He even spent the entire night out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although he went to the denominational chapels to listen to the messages last year he did not feel that they were interesting; therefore, he stopped going.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now that he has heard the gospel, he spends every evening in his room reading the Bible and praying, except when he comes to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is very joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is really a special blessing from the Father.</S>
