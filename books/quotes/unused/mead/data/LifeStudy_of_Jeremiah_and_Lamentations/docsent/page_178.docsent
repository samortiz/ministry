   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE FORTY THE KERNEL OF THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; 17:9; 13:23; 23:5-6; 33:16; 31:33</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to give a very brief concluding word to this life-study of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SHELL AND THE KERNEL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut: on the outside there is a hard shell, and on the inside there is a kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I read Jeremiah a number of times, but I touched only the "shell" of this book; I did not see anything of the "kernel."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gradually, the Lord has opened the shell of Jeremiah and has shown me the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message, therefore, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the kernel of the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kernel includes three matters what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jeremiah strongly presents these three matters to us, but they are concealed within the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to see these three things, we need to "crack" the shell of Jeremiah and concentrate on the kernel inside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WHAT GOD WANTS FROM US</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What God wants from us is mentioned mainly in 2:13, which reveals that God is the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants us to take Him as the fountain of living waters for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that He wants us to take Him as the source, the fountain, of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we take Him as our source?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only way to take God as the fountain of living waters is to drink of Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By drinking we take into us the living water that issues from God as the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The importance of drinking of God as the fountain is illustrated in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To the Samaritan woman who had come to the well to draw water and whom the Lord Jesus had asked to give Him a drink, He said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" v. 10 . When she asked Him where He could get this living water, He answered, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" v. 14 . The Lord's word here indicates that whatever we drink becomes one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we drink of God as the fountain of living waters, He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we drink of God, the more He is one with us and the more we are one with Him and constituted with Him in His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jeremiah 2:13 says, "My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The most evil thing in the eyes of God is to forsake Him as the source, as the fountain of living waters, and to turn to some other source.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All other sources are idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse the idols are likened to broken cisterns, which cannot hold water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People today are busy hewing out for themselves all kinds of cisterns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, these cisterns are idols.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we consider this situation, we need to realize that God wants us to take Him as the fountain, the source, of our life and our being.</S>
