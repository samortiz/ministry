<P>III."And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:2). God could not rest in a situation that was without form, void, and dark. Neither was He happy with a situation in which man was subdued under sin, death, and Satan. In such a fallen, desolate situation, it would not have been a surprise if God had forsaken man. Yet God did something that was altogether unexpected. Why was God still concerned about that which He had righteously judged? Why was God still mindful of the desolate and destroyed? Why did God still have compassion on something that was without form, void, and dark, which was not even worthy of His attention? These questions are hard to answer. It was only because of God's mercy and grace. God's love came to those who were not worthy of His love! And His heart had compassion on those who were not deserving of His compassion! Neither the desolate earth nor fallen humanity had any right to ask God to work. In their condition, to ask God for such compassion seemed beyond hope. In themselves, there was nothing worthy of God's love. Nevertheless, in spite of man's poverty, worthlessness, fall, and failure, God still gave His sovereign grace to those who were poor and unworthy. He gave His inexhaustible mercy to those who had fallen and failed.</P><P>His first step was by means of "the Spirit" moving "upon the face of the waters." Without the Spirit, how could the earth recover? How can a dead person resurrect himself? How can darkness turn itself into light? How can those who were under God's righteous judgment make themselves able to receive God's blessing? If not for the Holy Spirit's operation, how could a fallen one rise up? The desolate and weak creatures were helpless. How could they have been restored, revived, and resurrected without the operation of the Holy Spirit? If they tried to overcome and be revived by themselves, eventually they would admit, "In my flesh, nothing good dwells" (Rom. 7:18).</P><P>But thank and praise God! Although sinners cannot be reborn by themselves, just as the earth could not recover itself, although sinners cannot separate themselves from sin, just as the earth could not separate itself from the deep waters, although sinners cannot act righteously, just as the earth could not change from darkness into light, nevertheless, God Himself can rescue us. The new creation is the same as the old creation: both were created by God Himself. Man is unable to create his own spirit, just as he is unable to create the world. God has to do all the work. Thank and praise God! Although He was not obligated to rescue us, He provided unexpected grace and came to rescue us. God did what He did not have to do. That is mercy. What man did not deserve, he obtained. That is grace. Concerning salvation, man was in an absolute position of needing to receive help. If anyone thinks that within him or outside of him there is anything good, that is an insult to God and a despising of His grace.</P><P>The working of the Holy Spirit is the beginning of man's rebirth. In the original text, "moving" has the meaning of "overshadowing," "brooding." This indicates love and tenderness. This same word is used as "hovers" in Deuteronomy 32:11: "As the eagle rouses his nest, / Hovers over his young, / Spreads his wings, takes them, / And bears them up upon his pinions." Oh, may we respond more to the love of God! How His heart desires us! But who is "us"? We are just sinners, fallen humanity! He is not angry with us, nor does He look lightly upon us or reject us. He does not consider that even though we are without form and void and darkness, that we are unworthy of His Holy Spirit's brooding. Although He has "purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity" (Hab. 1:13), He humbled Himself to rescue those who were in the midst of dust and dung. O God! "What is man, that You remember him / And the son of man, that You visit him?" (Psa. 8:4). We really do not comprehend why God so loves sinners such as us. I especially do not comprehend why God loves me. Indeed, it is "not that we have loved God but that He loved us" (1 John 4:10). O God! How wonderful is Your grace! How true it is that Your "delights were with the sons of men" (Prov. 8:31).</P><P>God's love is the reason that we were born again. "For God so loved the world...that every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life" (John 3:16). God's love causes Him to work in the midst of desolation until He says, "Very good," and rests. Until what is desolate is completely recovered to a state of being "very good," His heart of love can never rest!</P><P>To be born again is the initial work and also the most important work. Without this work, God's light shines in vain. God first causes the Holy Spirit to work an incredible work within man. This serves as a preparation for His light to shine. "You must be born anew. The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:7-8).</P><P>What a sinner lacks is life. In this world nothing can replace life. Sinners do not want God and do not want the light that shines out of God in Christ. They hate it and reject it. "Men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil" (John 3:19). Only those that are born again love God's light. After man's second birth, he has feeling toward God's light, and his conscience causes him to be stirred up and turn to God.</P><P>IV."And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (Gen. 1:3). The previous verse said that "the Spirit of God moved." Here it says, "God said." This is God's word. The Spirit of God and the word of God are two inseparable co-workers. First, the Holy Spirit works; then the word of God works. We are born of the Holy Spirit (John 3:5-6), and we are also "regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God" (1 Pet. 1:23). "The entrance of thy words giveth light" (Psa. 119:130). Therefore, "God said [the word]...and there was light."</P>
