 <h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>May the Lord grant those of us who serve together a deep feeling that He needs a strong recovery. He needs a recovery of the building up. Building goes beyond edification. Our work is not merely for the edification of the saints in general; rather, it is to build up a Body, a spiritual house. Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The gifted ones are for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:22 says that in Christ the Jews and Gentiles are &ldquo;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; First Peter 2:5 says that we, &ldquo;as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; First Corinthians 3:10 says that Paul, as a wise master builder, laid a foundation and that we should take heed how we build upon it. We should build with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). Chapter 14 emphasizes earnestly desiring spiritual gifts for the sake of building up (vv. 1, 3-5, 12). This means that all the gifts should be for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>According to the verses above, God&rsquo;s desire in this age is to build the church, which is His house, the Body of Christ. Man dwells in his body and also in a house. Both are a dwelling place for man. When a person departs from the world, he is unclothed from his body. This means that he leaves his body, his dwelling place on earth. God&rsquo;s work in this age is to build a dwelling place for Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE BUILDING UP OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Hebrews 11:10 says that Abraham &ldquo;eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.&rdquo; The city with the foundations is the coming New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God with men (Rev. 21:3). In other words, the New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This does not mean that God has two different buildings in this age. He does not have the church on earth as one building and the holy city, the New Jerusalem, in the heavens as another city. God is not temporarily dwelling in the church today only to discard the church and move to the New Jerusalem in the future. The church and the New Jerusalem are one.</p>
<p>When God builds up the church, He is building up the New Jerusalem. These are two aspects of the same work. The church is the temple of God, the house of God, but in the New Jerusalem we will not see a temple (v. 22), because the temple will be enlarged into a city. The building of the temple is not one work, and the building of the city, another work. The coming New Jerusalem is the consummation of the church. The temple is enlarged to be a city.</p>
<p>In this age God&rsquo;s only work is building. Although His building work is on earth, it is heavenly. Although His building work is in time, it is eternal. Although God is building up the church on earth, this building is in the heavenly realm. Although God is building up the church in time, this building is eternal. The New Jerusalem is heavenly; it is full of the heavenly nature and the heavenly flavor.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s work in this age is the building of a dwelling place for Himself. In its initial stage it is a house, and in its mature stage it will be a city, which is the tabernacle of God with men. In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God is the temple of God. In the New Testament the church is the tabernacle of God and the temple of God. The New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men. There will be no temple in the New Jerusalem because everything will have reached maturity. The city is a tabernacle as well as an enlarged temple.</p>
