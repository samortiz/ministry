<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 15</h1><h2 class="head4">2. The Organism of the Triune God in the Divine Dispensing 15:1—16:4</h2><p><sup>1</sup>I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. <sup>2</sup>Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit. <sup>3</sup>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. <sup>4</sup>Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. <sup>5</sup>I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing. <sup>6</sup>If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. <sup>7</sup>If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. <sup>8</sup>In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples. <sup>9</sup>As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. <sup>10</sup>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love. <sup>11</sup>These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.</p><p><sup>12</sup>This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you. <sup>13</sup>No one has greater love than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. <sup>14</sup>You are My friends if you do what I command you. <sup>15</sup>No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. <sup>16</sup>You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you. <sup>17</sup>These things I command you that you may love one another.</p><p><sup>18</sup>If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you. <sup>19</sup>If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. <sup>20</sup>Remember the word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also. <sup>21</sup>But all these things they will do to you because of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me. <sup>22</sup>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. <sup>23</sup>He who hates Me hates My Father also. <sup>24</sup>If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father. <sup>25</sup>But it is so that the word written in their law may be fulfilled, “They hated Me without cause.” <sup>26</sup>But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; <sup>27</sup>And you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.</p>
