   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO PARTICULAR NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A division is called a denomination because it has been denominated by a particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, the first factor of a denomination is a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither the sun nor the moon has a particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sun is the sun, and the moon is the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have never heard of anyone giving a name to the sun or the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither the sun nor the moon needs a name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever I am, in the United States, Europe, or the Far East, the moon is the moon, and the sun is the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At most I can speak of the moon in Sydney, the moon in Paris, or the moon in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To give a special name to a certain group of Christians is to constitute them a sect, a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It makes them a denominated sect, a divisive sect with a particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any Christian group that has a particular name is a division, a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should have no name other than the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have believed in His name, and we have been baptized into His name, and now we are meeting in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Never think that the matter of the name is insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I must use my name in all I do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To use another name is deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Never think that it makes no difference what you call yourself, whether you say that you are Jones or Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is terrible to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My name is Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot call me Mr. Jones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The name means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If an inheritance were granted to me in my name, Witness Lee, but I call myself Mr. Jones, I would lose the right to claim and enjoy this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Never neglect this matter of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To take any name other than the name of the Lord Jesus is a form of spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How wrong it would be for my wife, Mrs. Witness Lee, to go by the name of another man! For a married woman to take another name is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never think that this matter is insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus praised the church in Philadelphia because they did not deny His name Rev 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the denominations have denied the Lord s name, because in addition to His name, they have taken names such as Baptist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Presbyterian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In taking these other names, the denominations have committed spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we honor the Lord and sincerely mean business with Him, we would certainly forsake every name other than that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addressing the contentious ones in the church at Corinth, Paul said, Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 Cor 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Paul seemed to be saying, Why do you say that you are of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must never say this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You were not baptized into my name you were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must not be under any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>NO PARTICULAR FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been baptized into the unique name, the name above every name, and we have also been called into the fellowship of the Son of God 1 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ has become the fellowship of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First John 1:3 says, That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The we and the us mentioned in this verse refer to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostle John seemed to be saying, We, the apostles, have declared to you the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this life you may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This fellowship is also called communion or participation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The meaning is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever term we use, there is something called fellowship, the common participation in Christ, which is common to all believers in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever has believed into Him is now in the fellowship of our wonderful Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This fellowship is common to you, to me, and to every regenerated one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, many Christians do not have this unique fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, they have a different so-called fellowship, a special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every special fellowship constitutes a division.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some Christians may not be denominated; that is, they may not have a name for their group, but they do have a particular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Their fellowship is not as large as the common fellowship of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, it is small and particular.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let me give some illustrations from my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I was young, my mother was a Southern Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Southern Baptist denomination she attended had communion only a few times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever they had communion, they made a strong, serious, and solemn announcement to the effect that anyone who did not belong to the Southern Baptist denomination could not participate in their communion service.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When some who were not members wanted to take communion, the pastor told them they had to wait, pass an examination, and be immersed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One man said that he had already been immersed, but the pastor said, We don t care how many times you have been immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you want to take the holy communion with us, then you must be baptized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are unwilling to do this, then you are not welcome to share holy communion with us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This illustrates the fact that those Baptists had a particular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although the Southern Baptists in the United States make up nearly one fourth of the total number of regenerated ones, they still do not have the common fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Their fellowship is particular, and it constitutes them a division.</S>
