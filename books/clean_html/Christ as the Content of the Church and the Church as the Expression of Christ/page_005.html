<p>Now we come to the last part of Romans (chs. 12—16). This shows us that we will be built up together as the Body of Christ, the church, to express Christ. We express Christ because Christ is wrought into us. We have been not only justified but also translated out of Adam into Christ. Because Christ has been wrought into us, what we have and what we are is Christ. We have been sanctified, that is, saturated and permeated by and with Christ. Now we live by and in Him, so we become His image. As those who are conformed to His image, we become His expression. Then we are built together, not in ourselves but in Him. This is like the wooden boards of the tabernacle being framed and built together in the overlaying gold. We are built together not in ourselves but in Christ.<p>From chapter twelve through sixteen, we see the real expression of Christ in the functions of the different members. The functions are the gifts, which are the expression of the grace deposited into us. Romans 12:6 says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us. This is because the gifts are the outward expression of the inward grace. The inward grace is Christ deposited into us. Christ has been wrought into us as a deposit. We have a portion of Christ within us as the grace, and this grace expressed is the function, the gift. Thus, all the gifts are the expression of the inward grace, which is Christ deposited into us.<p>The gifts mentioned in Romans 12 are absolutely different from the miraculous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12. The gifts in Romans 12 are the expressions of the inner grace, which is Christ. The inner, deposited grace is expressed outwardly, and this outward expression is the gift. This gift is manifested in different ways.<p>As those who are justified by God, we should be sanctified daily by being overlaid with His divine nature. Then we are under the process of transformation and are being conformed to Christ’s image. We have a certain amount of Christ within us as grace deposited into us. Perhaps a certain brother, out of the measure of Christ within him, has a burden to give hospitality to many traveling saints (12:13b). When the saints come to his home, he spontaneously serves them, takes care of them, and displays love, which is Christ expressed through him. This hospitality is a gift, and this gift is an expression of the inner grace which is Christ deposited and wrought into him.<p>Let us consider the experience of another brother, who is being gradually sanctified, overlaid with the divine nature of God. A certain amount of Christ has been wrought into him, so gradually he has the burden to give material things to others (v. 13a). In his giving you can sense the flavor of Christ, the reality of Christ, and the presence of Christ. This giving of material things is an expression of inner grace, so this gift expresses Christ.<p>Another brother who has been justified and sanctified to a certain extent may have the heart to always show mercy to others (v. 8b). But others do not sense that he is merely a merciful person. In his showing of mercy, others sense the flavor and the tenderness of Christ. Even this showing of mercy is an expression of the inner grace, which is Christ.<p>In this way the members are built together and express Christ in many aspects. We become a living Body expressing Christ in many ways. Christ is expressed in the way His members minister, serve, show mercy, give material things, show love (v. 9a), and give hospitality to meet others’ needs. Because we have been justified and sanctified, Christ has been wrought into us to a certain extent, and we have a certain amount of Christ as the deposited grace. Gradually, something will come out of this inward grace, and this coming out is the outward gift, the function, with the expression of Christ in our gift.<p>Thus, the whole book of Romans shows us that Christ must be wrought into us as our life and content and the church must be the expression of Christ. In this book, which is a full record of the Christian life, there is the expression of Christ and nothing else. There is not the expression of any doctrine but of Christ, who is the Redeemer and our portion within to be wrought into us to conform us to His image. The grace is deposited into us that it may become the very outward function, and this outward function is the expression of Christ in reality.<p>Whenever and wherever we come together, we come as such an expression of Christ. We are not here to express anything else. We are not standing for anything but Christ Himself. I have a real burden that all the dear brothers and sisters would be helped to realize this one thing—to know Christ as the life and content of the church. We need to experience Christ to such an extent and learn to minister Christ as the life, the content, and everything to the church.
