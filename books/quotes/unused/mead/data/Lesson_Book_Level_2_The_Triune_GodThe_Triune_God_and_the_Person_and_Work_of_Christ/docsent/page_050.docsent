   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Christ as Our High Priest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ascended Christ is also ministering to our inward need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Old Testament times the high priest ministered to God on behalf of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews tells us that Christ is our great High Priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses 4:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Christ became a man, He thoroughly knows our weak points and problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But He is also God, constituted according to the power of an indestructible life Heb 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore He is able to take care of us in any situation Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely every hour we need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From hour to hour we do not know what situations will confront us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes troubles come to us and we get anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we were saved, these worries were endless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But now, when anxious thoughts arise, we soon sense a soothing comfort, saying to us, "Why don't you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You don't need to worry."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ has begun to intercede for us, and this is the effect it produces.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we respond to Him, "Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You bear my worries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All my cares are in Your hand."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just a few short words and the anxiety is lifted!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is Christ's priestly intercession for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is unending.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should have many experiences of being reminded, comforted, strengthened, and even carried by our great High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>V. OUR COOPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is more than qualified for the great offices He holds in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is working day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is controlling every event on the earth from the rise and fall of nations to the teacher you get for English.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All this is so that He can carry out God's great eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet without our cooperation, the ascended Christ can do very little.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is our great Head but we are His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On earth, He can move only through us, His members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ requires our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He desires all men to be saved but He cannot save them unless we speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this respect, the almighty God cannot do anything unless we cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a responsibility, but what a privilege!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can be those who allow God to move on the earth for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are the V.I.P.'s of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we must be faithful to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>QUESTIONS How wonderful it is that Jesus was made Lord, Head over all things.</S>
