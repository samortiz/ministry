<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Wise Inheriting Honor</H2><P>The wise will inherit honor, but fools increase their own disgrace (v. 35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Getting Wisdom and Not Forsaking Her</H2><P>We should get wisdom. We should not forsake her, and she will keep us; we should love her, and she will guard us (4:5-6). "The beginning of wisdom is this:/Get wisdom; and in all your getting, get understanding./Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;/She will honor you if you embrace her./She will give a garland of grace for your head;/A crown of beauty will she bestow on you" (vv. 7-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Saying That Wisdom Is Our Sister</H2><P>According to 7:4 we should say to wisdom, "You are my sister."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Wisdom Having Built Her House</H2><P>Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars (9:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Personified Wisdom of God</H2><P>In certain portions of Proverbs the wisdom of God is personified. This personification of God's wisdom is the second of the Trinity, the Son of God. Christ is the personified wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah by Wisdom Founding the Earth</H2><P>Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; He established the heavens by understanding (3:19). This One by whom Jehovah founded the earth and established the heavens is Christ, who is the wisdom of God.</P>
