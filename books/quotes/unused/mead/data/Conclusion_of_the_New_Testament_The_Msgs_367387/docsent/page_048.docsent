   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Coming to Him as Living Stones to Be Built Up</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as a Spiritual House into a Holy Priesthood,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Offer Up Spiritual Sacrifices</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acceptable to God through Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 2:5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is through regeneration and transformation that we who were made of clay can be living stones Rom 9:21; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growing in us transforms us into living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to John 1:42, Andrew brought his brother Simon Peter to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas which is interpreted, Peter .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, in Caesarea Philippi, the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, But you, who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matt 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter took the lead to declare, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . In His response to Peter, the Lord said, I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . Here the name Peter means a stone, which is material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his ministry Peter emphasizes the matter of a stone probably because a crucial part of his experience as one of the Lord s disciples was the Lord s changing his name from Simon to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We come to Christ as living stones to be built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spiritual house, which is the church 1 Tim 3:15 , is a priesthood, which is a priestly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The totality of the corporate priestly service of the believers is the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The holy priesthood, which is a spiritual house built up with the believers as many stones, is the priestly ministry of the believers as many priests to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Our Coming to Him as Living Stones</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is Christ for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Peter 1:23 Peter said that we have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God as the incorruptible seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:4 Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life 1:23-24 , to a stone, which is of the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seed is for life-planting; the stone is for building 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter s thought went on from life-planting to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As life to us, Christ is the seed; for God s building, He is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus He will make us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone Isa 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Peter 2:4-5 Peter speaks of our coming to Him, a living stone, and our being living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word rendered coming can also be translated approaching, drawing near, coming forward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We become living stones by coming to Christ as the living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to 2:2, we as newborn babes long for the guileless milk of the word; according to verse 4, we need to come to Christ as the living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that we come to the Lord by drinking the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The milk of the word is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when we drink the milk, we come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word coming mentioned in verse 4 is equal to drinking, implied in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when we drink the milk, we come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the all-inclusive One, Christ is both milk and the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need more experience of Christ as the milk and the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the morning we should drink Christ as milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then during the day, the process of transformation should take place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the evening we should come to the church meetings and fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we see that in the morning Christ is milk, and in the evening He becomes the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the day, the milk does a transforming work within us to produce a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who do not experience Christ as milk may like to be scattered or independent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although some believers visit them and encourage them to come to the meetings, they do not want to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet they may begin to have a desire to drink the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they drink the milk, they will long to come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord is first milk to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the nourishment in the milk of the word, transformation takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we have the building, where the Lord Himself is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason that in chapter 2 we first have the milk and then the stone.</S>
