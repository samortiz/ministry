   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Advising and Encouraging Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Wait on God and to Be Strong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Encouraged in Their Heart</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the end of Psalm 27, David advised and encouraged others to wait on God and to be strong and encouraged in their heart v. 14 . This is good, but it is altogether human activity which is not according to the standard of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Paul's word in Galatians 2:20 and Philippians 1:21a, every one of God's elect should confess, "I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is no more I who live but Christ lives within me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even now I live not by my faith but by the faith of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I live by Him as my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am altogether finished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am nothing but a dead and buried corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not know what it is to be encouraged and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I only know that I have been crucified and that Christ now lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we Christians had such a view, such a revelation, held within us, our attitude toward and our appreciation of the Psalms would be absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The chorus of #539 in Hymns says: "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!/How dear and near to me!/How I admire Thy marvelous/Availability!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord today is not only approachable but also available.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If food is only approachable to us, this is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The food has to be available for us to eat so that we can become one with the food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Approachability is not so good as availability.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today in God's New Testament economy, God is not only approachable but also available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said, "I am the bread of life...he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To eat is to take Him, the available One, as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also said that we need to drink of Him as the living water John 4:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the book of John, all the items concerning Christ are not just approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of them are available good for us to enjoy, that is, good for us to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A FURTHER WORD ON THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I would like to say a further word on the enjoyment of God in the house of God as seen in Book One of the Psalms, comprising Psalms 1 41.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A number of items of David's enjoyment are good, but many of them are objective and not available.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>David said that he lifted up his hands unto the innermost sanctuary Psa 28:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is altogether objective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David also said that those in God's temple all said, "Glory!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>29:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God is merely the glory outside of us, He has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Objective glory does not help us, but our being subjectively mingled with the Triune God works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The chorus of Hymns, #1199 says, "Mingle, mingle, hallelujah...Yes, mingling is the way!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God's New Testament economy, subjective mingling is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Psalm 36:7-9, David's enjoyment of God in God's house is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These verses show us the subjective enjoyment of the available riches in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The psalmist said that we could be saturated with the fatness, the abundance, the riches, of God's house v. 8a . We can be saturated with all the fullness of God within God's house by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I want to say again that we should pay attention to the revelation in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this Gospel, the two crucial words are eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the bread from heaven, Jesus is eatable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is also drinkable as the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we drink of the living water, it will become in us a spring of water, gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eating and drinking the Lord to enjoy Him as our spiritual life supply is so crucial, but this is missed in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In God's house we can drink of the river of God's pleasures Psa 36:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not just one pleasure but many pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We Christians do not need worldly amusements, entertainment, parties, or clubs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our "club" is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the best club on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have our pleasures here in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our amusement is the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can see a picture of this flowing river in Genesis 2, and this river, the river of water of life in Revelation 22, will be flowing forever.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Psalm 36:9a says that we can be those sharing of the fountain of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the book of Jeremiah, God condemned Israel because Israel forsook Him as the fountain of living waters 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But in God's house we can share of the fountain of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, we can see light in God's light Psa 36:9b .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In God's house we have the food, the river, the fountain of life, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These four things are altogether not objective.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Food is for eating, the river is for drinking, the fountain is for sharing of, and the light is for us to participate in by seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What an enjoyment this is!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This enjoyment in Psalm 36 is much deeper, much higher, and much more profound than the enjoyment of God's house in Psalm 27.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Psalm 36 everything is available.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The food is available, the river is available, the fountain of life is available, and the light is available.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have the availability of the riches in God's house for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This enjoyment will eventually lead us to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the New Jerusalem, we will be saturated with the fruit of the tree of life; we will drink of the river of the water of life; we will share of the fountain of God's life; and we will also see light in God's divine light Rev 22:1-2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the consummate enjoyment of God in the house of God.</S>
