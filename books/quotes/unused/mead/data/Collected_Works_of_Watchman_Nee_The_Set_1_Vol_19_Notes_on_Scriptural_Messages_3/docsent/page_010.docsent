   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEGINNING AND ENDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider how these three lines begin and end. What was Peter doing when God called him? He was casting a net into the sea with his brother Andrew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What about John?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was mending a net on a ship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is quite marvelous that God had properly arranged their works when they were called.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter was casting a net when he was called; later he did the work of casting a net.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His work was to charge forward to the front of the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He started the work with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was also the first to preach to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He cast a net and caught many Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He cast another net and caught many Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But later the net in man's view was broken, and the kingdom was forsaken by the people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fish were leaking out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, God called John to mend the net and recover it back to the original new condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us see what God appointed for Paul when he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Paul was about to persecute the believers, God shined a light on him on his way to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul's first words were, "What shall I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His work always involved "what to do."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was not like Peter, who in one day led three thousand or five thousand people to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He saved only a few or, at the most, a few dozen because his purpose was not to draw people in but to perfect people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The subject of his work was how-to: how to do things right, how to build a house, how to arrange its contents, how to trim the cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These were his works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His occupation was tent-making.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A tent is a place for a man to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Spiritually speaking, Paul was also a tent-maker.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unlike Peter, who only had a piece of cloth, Paul's cloth became a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But what was men's attitude toward the works of these three persons?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was not good at all!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was very bad!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all will sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the end of their days, men rejected their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Peter shows us this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In chapter two, the false prophets came.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They came especially to do a counterfeit work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, Peter described them as dogs and sows; they made things worse and caused God's kingdom to be concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter three, the mockers came.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They despised what Peter preached, treating it as a loathsome and shameful thing!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The testimony of the kingdom was completely rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know why Peter wrote his second Epistle?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was written because the first Epistle had been rejected and thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why he had to write his second Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He described in his second Epistle the final condition of his lifetime testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It exposed and proclaimed all of men's rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The situation was bad in Peter's time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How much worse has it become in the twentieth century!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is hardly anyone who does not oppose the testimony of the kingdom when they hear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is hardly anyone who does not say that we are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No wonder so many people promote the so-called ideal kingdom; no wonder the counterfeit truth is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Oh, they were there in Peter's days!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not surprising or uncommon that they are here today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only did Peter's testimony end this way; Paul's testimony ended the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The last Epistle written by him was 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Three to five years after writing it, he died.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can see from this Epistle the condition that existed at the end of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was too difficult to manifest the Lord; there were too many restrictions, and it was indeed unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, at the time of Paul's and Peter's death, the church was fully degraded in its outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It had fallen into the condition described in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How much worse is the situation today!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul when he was old.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What did he say?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said that everyone was after their own things Phil 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Men put Paul's testimony aside.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They considered their own things to be too important.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, they gave up the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a person takes care of himself, he cannot take care of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since he does not have enough time to take care of his own business, he has even less time to take care of the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is nothing else he can do except to ignore the Lord's business!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul's testimony was rejected and forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, his last words were to exhort the saints to be watchful and be constantly aware of the intrusion of heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul's testimony ended this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It seems that the testimonies had completely failed in their outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>So the Lord needed to use John.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord needed him to take care of the inner works.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Consider the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not like Matthew's which emphasized doctrines, or like Luke's which stressed morality, or like Mark's which recorded history.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>John only wrote about the relationship between God and us, a relationship between father and sons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He did not begin his Gospel with Adam or Abraham but with Jesus Christ from the beginning, from the very first beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He began this way because outward appearances had failed and neither Adam nor Abraham could turn the situation back.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What was needed was that which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Who can shake the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No one can.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The beginning can never be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whatever comes from God can never be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Gospel of John is on the Word from the beginning, which was expressed in order to lead us back to the condition of the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What was there in the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There was life, light, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>None of these things can be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, they are the inward realities.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>John never talked about outward things such as husbands and wives, masters and servants, meetings, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He never mentioned these things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What he mentioned was just the things on God's side which are absolutely inward.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we do not see this difference, we will not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We still need to beseech God earnestly until we see the difference.</S>
