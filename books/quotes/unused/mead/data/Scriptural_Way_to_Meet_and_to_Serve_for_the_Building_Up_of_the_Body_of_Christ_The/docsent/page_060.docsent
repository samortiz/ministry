   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO TEACH THE NEW ONES AS IN TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>YOUNG CHILDREN TO LEARN A LANGUAGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we have the increase of the knowledge and experience of the word, we are qualified to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To teach others requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A kindergarten instructor has to be instructed how to teach the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A high school teacher also needs to be instructed how to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we go out to preach the gospel and people get saved and baptized, we should immediately begin to help them have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my knowledge and experience, to have home meetings with the new ones is a most difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We spent much time in our full-time training in Taipei on this matter, and we are still learning and improving our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In less than two years in Taipei, we baptized thirty-eight thousand, but we did not consider that we did not have enough people to care for these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We learned that from now on we have to apportion our labor according to our manpower and the time that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If parents are not capable of taking care of a lot of children, they should not have that many children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person may beget twenty-four new ones when he is only capable of taking care of six.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So eighteen new ones would be left without any care.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A certain local church may only have the personnel with the proper time to take care of two hundred new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In principle then, this church should not go out to get more than two hundred new ones to receive the Lord and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This church may have the ability to bring more people to the Lord, but they would not have the manpower or the time to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our preaching of the gospel, we also practiced to lead a person to believe and be baptized within fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From now on after new ones are baptized, we will try to stay with them for an hour to have a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to our experience, the best time to help the new ones know some basic things is immediately after they have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That time will lay a very good foundation to preserve them in their home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first thing to tell the new ones immediately after they have been baptized is that they have been saved based upon the precious blood of Christ by the regeneration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to tell them that they have been regenerated in their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should give them at least two verses to show them that their salvation is by regeneration through the Holy Spirit in their human spirit John 3:3, 5-6; 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now they have to learn to use their spirit to pray to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should demonstrate to them how to pray by exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to show them how to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the first lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is best if we can stay with the newly baptized ones for an hour, if their time allows, to cover this point concerning the two spirits, the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that matters like this are too deep for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must exercise your faith to tell them some new things in a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to believe that they will understand, and you have to present these truths in a very skillful way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not present things merely in the way of knowledge, but help them to enter into the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not teach too much but show them the proper practice and help them to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The next time we go back to meet with them, we should spend a half hour to an hour to help them to begin their Christian life with praying and reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the best way to begin the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After covering the matter of praying and reading the Bible, we have to help the new ones follow their inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have been regenerated and have received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the Holy Spirit is dwelling within them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The indwelling Spirit gives them an inner feeling, an inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may illustrate to a new one that before he was saved, he may have gotten angry with someone, maybe with one of his neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He may have even been happy about the way he dealt with his neighbor in an angry way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you can ask him how he feels within since he has been saved for only a short time when he gets angry with someone in a hateful way now, does he feel good within?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He would say that he does not feel so good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Based on this fact, you can point out to him that he has a sensation, a feeling, a consciousness, that he did not have before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you can tell him, From now on as a real Christian you have to live, to do things, to deal with people, and to deal with matters according to this inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to lay the foundation with the new believers with these three stones: using their spirit to contact the Lord by prayer, praying and reading the Bible, and behaving according to the inner feeling, the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Based upon this foundation, we can build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, every time you have a home meeting with the new ones, you have to charge them to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to set yourself up as a model, an example, of one who calls on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Immediately after their baptism have them start calling on the name of the Lord and encourage them to call all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The above three matters, including calling on the name of the Lord, are the foundation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can then build upon this foundation and help them with many other things such as the clearance of their past and their old living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The new believers are like babes who learn from and imitate their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You need to take heed to yourself 1 Tim 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are a rough person, the new ones will learn your roughness, and they will be rough Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After you contact the new ones on a regular basis for three months, they may be the same as you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, you must be a praying person, giving the new ones an impression that you bear a spirit, an attitude, and an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you contact the new ones, you must give them such an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This will affect them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not just tell them that they need to learn how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They will learn from you and imitate whatever you are.</S>
