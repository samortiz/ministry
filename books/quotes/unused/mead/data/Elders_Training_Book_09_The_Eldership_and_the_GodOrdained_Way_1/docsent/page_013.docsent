   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THEIR BELIEVING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should baptize someone, if possible, immediately after he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible does not tell us that a person has to wait to be baptized after he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not need to wait so that we can baptize people in the baptistry of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 8 shows us that the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized by Philip immediately after believing in the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Philippian jailor was baptized by Paul and Silas immediately after he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 16:33b and 34a say, "He was baptized immediately, he and all his household.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And he brought them up into his house...."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After his baptism, the jailor brought Paul and Silas "up" into his house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that this must have been done downstairs in the bathing pool at the place where they were see note 1 of verse 33 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we practiced this, many people were shocked, but this is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible shows us that baptism is practiced immediately after someone believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING DESPERATE FOR THE LORD'S INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to reconsider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders should take the lead to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then meetings should be set up in the homes of the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to teach them the truth and help them to grow in life and to know Christ in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, they will be perfected to do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to be revolutionized to learn something new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not practice the church life in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to pick up the new way, beginning with preaching the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The number one thing in preaching the gospel is that we need to be desperate to gain new ones for the Lord's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also have to exercise our faith to apply the Lord's authority, standing on Matthew 28:18-19, where the Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we go out to preach the gospel we should pray, "Lord, I stand on this word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your authority is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I go with Your authority."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are sharing the gospel with people, we should not ask them if they would like to receive the Lord and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do this, they will say "no" most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, we need to exercise the Lord's authority and direct them to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we go out to preach the gospel, we must be cleared up with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must practice making a thorough confession of our failures, sinfulness, and wrongdoings so that we can receive the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will not go empty and alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we will go to people filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that from now on the leading ones in the churches would take the lead to preach the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Going out to visit people is the most effective way to spread the gospel for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those of us who go out for the spread of the gospel must be strict with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any looseness can bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be serious, not only before man but also before God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not here for doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are here for the Lord Christ, and we want to give Him a way to come back.</S>
