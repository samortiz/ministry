   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we do in our daily living depends upon the law we are living by.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To do good is a law, to do evil is another law, and to live by life is still another law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not think that you can do anything without a law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything we do as Christians in our daily living is a function of one of the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose I become angry at a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I may try to suppress my anger and say to myself, Although you are angry with this brother, you must not show it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you lose your temper, you will also lose your face and cause a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such behavior is not genuine; it is political.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, it cannot last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some who suppress their anger develop stomach trouble as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we may be political in this way, eventually the law of the satanic life will cause us to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To suppress our temper is to play politics; to lose it is to live according to the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are genuine, real, and frank, whatever we do or say will be a function of one of these laws.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything is determined by the law we live by each day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we live by the human life, the law of the human life will function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the human life is weak, and its law is fragile because of the presence of the law of the satanic life, which is much stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah, we have the strongest law in us, the law of the Spirit of life!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should live not by our human life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Romans 8 Paul says that we should walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To walk according to spirit is to live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we live by the divine life, the law of this life, the strongest law, works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No law can defeat the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this law we are freed from every difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be concerned about your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as you walk according to the spirit and live by the law of the divine life, this law will work for you spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to be reminded to push the right button, not the button which causes the law that to function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not teach me to love my wife, for in my human life I simply cannot do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, teach me to put my finger on the right button, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I do this, I shall love my wife spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, do not teach the sisters to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you teach them to do this, the less they will be able to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, teach them to press the right button, and they will submit to their husbands automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The right button is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit witnesses with our spirit 8:16 , and the button is the Spirit of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day and hour by hour, we must keep our finger on this button.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To do this is to have our mind set on the spirit and to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never take your finger off the button of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you keep your finger on the button, you will be in the spirit, the Spirit will be life to you, and every negative thing will be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The secret to keeping our finger on the right button is to know that we have a human spirit and that the Spirit of life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to turn our mind, our whole being, to the spirit and to set our mind there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we do this, all the negative things are spontaneously put to death, and we enjoy the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we do this, the desire for good by the human life with its law of good is satisfied, and the requirements of the law of God are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the evil law of the satanic life is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not try to love or to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, turn your being to your spirit and keep your finger on the right button, that is, on the Lord Himself, who is everything to us as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way you will enjoy Him, and you will live by the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
