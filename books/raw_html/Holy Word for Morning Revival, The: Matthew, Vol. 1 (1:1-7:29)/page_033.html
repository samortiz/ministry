<p class="bold">WEEK 5 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 7:1-3, 5-7, 11</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Do <sup>2</sup>not judge, that you be not judged.</p><p class="bold">2 &nbsp;For <sup>1</sup>with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.</p><p>3 &nbsp;And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not <sup>1</sup>consider?</p><p>5 &nbsp;Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will <sup>1</sup>see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye.</p> <p class="bold">6 &nbsp;Do not give <sup>1</sup>that which is holy to the <sup>2</sup>dogs, neither cast your <sup>1</sup>pearls before the <sup>2</sup>hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.</p><p class="bold">7 &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.</p><p>11 &nbsp;If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give <sup>1</sup>good things to those who ask Him!</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> The sixth section of the new King’s decree on the mountain, vv. 1-12, concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others.</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others.</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the kingdom people will be judged with what they judge others. If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged with righteousness by the Lord; if they judge others with mercy, they will be judged with mercy by the Lord. Mercy triumphs over judgment (James 2:13).</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> As the kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the beam in our own eye whenever we look at the splinter in our brother’s eye. The splinter in our brother’s eye must remind us of the beam in our own eye.</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> As long as the beam remains in our eye, our vision is blurred and we cannot see clearly.</p><p>6<sup>1</sup> That which is holy must refer to the objective truth, which belongs to God; your pearls must refer to the subjective experiences, which are ours.</p><p>6<sup>2</sup> Dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud; hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud. Thus, both are unclean (Lev. 11:27, 7). According to the revelation in 2 Pet. 2:12, 19-22, and Phil. 3:2, dogs and hogs here refer to people who are religious but not clean.</p><p>7<sup>1</sup> First ask, then seek, and last knock. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> In the parallel verse, Luke 11:13, it is the Holy Spirit instead of good things, because Luke emphasizes the blessing of the gospel, the center of which is the Spirit (Gal. 3:8, 14). Since Matthew stresses the kingdom of the heavens, good things should refer to the blessings of the reality of the kingdom, as revealed in chs. 5—7, blessings to be given as gifts to the kingdom people.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Apparently, the Lord’s intention in 7:1-12 is to cover the principles according to which the kingdom people deal with others. Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others.</p><p>If you take care of others, you will not judge them, criticize them, or measure them.…Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life. If you refrain from measuring others, you will be kept from criticizing them and judging them.…Mercy does not do any measuring.…Mercy is absolutely blind.…In helping others, we must be blind.…We must consider them, sympathize with them, and be merciful toward them. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 283, 285-286)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 283-293; Hymns: #857</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
