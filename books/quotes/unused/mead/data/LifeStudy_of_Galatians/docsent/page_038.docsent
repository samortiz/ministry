   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last Adam in 1 Corinthians 15:45b and the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 both refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates clearly that today Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST CRUCIFIED ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 3:1 Paul declares that before the eyes of the Galatian believers Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord was crucified on the cross as Christ, not as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot say that the Spirit was crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was Christ who was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST ENTERING AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INTO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Galatians through hearing the gospel believed in the crucified Christ, but they received the Spirit 3:2; 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who entered into the believers was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In crucifixion for the believers redemption He was Christ, but in the indwelling to be the believers life He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers receive such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He enters into the believers and lives in them, not by their keeping the law, but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not think that the One who died on the cross is different from the One who enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The One who died for us is the very One who has entered into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this One died on the cross, He died as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He enters into us to be our life, He comes in as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In crucifixion for our redemption He was Christ 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in the indwelling to be our life He is the Spirit Rom 8:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE SAVED ONES BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN THE CRUCIFIED AND RESURRECTED CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BUT RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We believe in the crucified and resurrected Christ, but we receive the Spirit 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The title of the One in whom we believe is Christ, not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, when we believe in Christ, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the One who was crucified for the accomplishment of redemption and who was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when He comes into us, He comes in as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the function of redemption, His title is Christ, whereas in the function of life, His title is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the most important Person in the universe, Christ has more than one status.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although Christ and the Spirit are one, there is a difference in function, title, and status.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>V. CHRIST IN THE REVELATION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AND THE SPIRIT IN OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the revelation of God s economy in the first two chapters of Galatians, the emphasis is on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in our experience of life as presented in the last four chapters, the emphasis is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have you noticed that in Galatians 1 and 2 there is no mention of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, verse after verse speaks of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Beginning with 3:2, the Spirit is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit in chapter three is the very Christ in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not think that the Spirit is separate from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the chapters which deal with the revelation of God s economy, we read of Christ, but in those chapters which unfold our experience of life, we read of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, Galatians gives us a revelation of God s economy; on the other hand, it affords us a revelation of our experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The former is objective, whereas the latter is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the objective revelation of God s economy the emphasis is on Christ, but in the subjective experience of life the emphasis is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE BELIEVERS RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE AND ULTIMATE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As believers, we have received the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, as the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the understanding of many Christians, the One they received when they believed in the Lord Jesus was only Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not many realize that the One they received was not the objective Christ, but the subjective Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because many are not clear concerning this, they talk about a so-called second blessing, or about receiving the Spirit apart from regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When some Christians learn that another has believed in Christ, they proceed to ask him if he has received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, to be a genuine Christian is to believe in Christ and to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To be a real Christian is to believe in Christ, and to believe in Christ is to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, those who regard Christ as separate and distinct from the Spirit may consider that it is possible to believe in Christ without receiving the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a serious misunderstanding!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As we have pointed out again and again in this message, we simultaneously believe in Christ and receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When certain Christians are asked if they have received the Spirit, they are not clear or do not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They need to see that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, an organic union took place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the very time of our conversion, a wonderful organic union between us and the Lord Jesus was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because they are ignorant of the fact of such an organic union, they do not enjoy the Spirit as the ultimate blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead of enjoying this blessing, they are distracted to regulations, doctrine, or to the study of the Bible in dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Others may pursue what is called the second blessing or the outpouring of the Spirit with speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But in the four books which make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians nothing is said about tongues-speaking or about the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, Paul places strong emphasis on the sealing of the Spirit, the earnest of the Spirit, and the foretaste of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were sealed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the very moment the organic union took place, the earnest of the Spirit was given.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In other words, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit, and the Spirit became to us the ultimate blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Judaizers were ignorant of this mysterious organic union with Christ, and the Galatian believers were not clear about it and were distracted from it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The same is true of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because so many believers do not realize what took place within them at the time they believed in the Lord Jesus, they are distracted and occupied with other things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, it is crucial for us to see what happened in us when we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By means of an organic union we were grafted into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now all the Triune God is, has done, has accomplished, and has obtained and attained has become our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Because the Judaizers were troubling the believers in Galatia and because the believers themselves were lacking in understanding, Paul was burdened to write this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was especially burdened to cover the matters in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every believer must be clear that Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This oneness is a mystery for our enjoyment.</S>
