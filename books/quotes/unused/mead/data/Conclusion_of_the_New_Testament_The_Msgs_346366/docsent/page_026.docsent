   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Christ Being the Head of All Rule and Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:10 Paul indicates that the Christ in whom we have been made full is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As previously mentioned, the rule and authority spoken of here refer to the angelic powers, in particular the fallen angels who still occupy positions of power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the full revelation of the Bible, after God created the universe, He placed it under the control of an archangel and other leading angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When this archangel rebelled against God and became Satan, many of the leading angels who assisted him in ruling the universe became the evil rulers and authorities in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are described in Ephesians 6:12 as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These angelic powers rule over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, the book of Daniel mentions both the prince of Greece and the prince of Persia 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A prince here denotes one of the angelic powers or rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that all the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since Christ is our perfection and completion, we do not need other rulers and authorities as objects of adoration, for He is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should remember that the Colossians had been led astray to the worship of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are identified with the One who is the Head of all the angels, and in Him we have been made full.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are clear about this, we will never be deluded into worshipping angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we will have the proper knowledge that, in a very real sense, because we are one with the Head of the angels, we are higher than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, we are partners of the Christ who is the Head over them, and in Him we are complete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that we have been made full in Christ who is the Head of all rule and authority is versus the worship of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we are one with Christ, we should never worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>e. In Him the Saints Being Circumcised,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>in the Circumcision of Christ, Buried Together with Him</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in Baptism and Raised Together with Him</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Colossians 2:11 Paul says, In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul is dealing with Judaizers who prize and boast in their circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul thus declares that in Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the saints have been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This circumcision is not merely to cut off a piece of flesh but to put off the entire body of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also the circumcision of Christ, that is, to be crucified with Him, buried together with Him in baptism, and raised together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 Being Circumcised with a Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not Made with Hands</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 11 Paul speaks of a circumcision not made with hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This certainly is different from that practiced by the Jews, which was carried out with a knife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition to that physical circumcision, there is another kind of circumcision, the circumcision in Christ, which is not made with hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is spiritual circumcision and refers to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The circumcision in Christ involves the death of Christ and the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Christ was crucified, His crucifixion was the genuine, practical, and universal circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His crucifixion cut off all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These negative things include our flesh, our natural man, and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, along with the death of Christ we need the Spirit as the power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have Christ s crucifixion without the Spirit as the power, we will have no means by which to apply Christ s crucifixion to us and to execute its effect upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The crucifixion of Christ becomes practical and effective by means of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the Spirit as the power, Christ s crucifixion is applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then under the power of the Spirit, we are circumcised in an actual and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the circumcision in Christ, a circumcision not made with hands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a circumcision not made with hands because it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the circumcision we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ, on the one hand, we have been made full, and, on the other hand, we have been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we have been made full in Him, we are short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we have been circumcised in Him, all the negative things have been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regarding the positive things, we are complete.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regarding the negative things, everything has been cleared up, and we have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, regarding the positive things, we are not short of anything, and regarding the negative things, we are no longer troubled by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we need to exercise faith and not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must turn our eyes away from our feelings and from our apparent situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to our apparent situation, we are short of everything positive and are troubled by everything negative.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But according to the facts, we are not in ourselves we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because we are in Him, we have been made full positively, and we have been circumcised to clear away the negative things.</S>
