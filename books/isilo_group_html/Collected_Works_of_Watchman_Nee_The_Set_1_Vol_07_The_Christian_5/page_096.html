"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." The cross is related to the kingdom. Verse 21 is a prophecy, whereas verse 28 is a revelation.</P><P>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings." "Doings" refers to the act of saving one's soul-life or losing one's soul-life in verse 25.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 17</H2><P>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." Do not say too quickly, "Hear Him," for this hearing may refer to 16:21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 24</H2><P>Verses 1-2:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple. But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down." How cold is our Lord toward the world! The temple can be compared to the world. He passed through this world without giving heed to it. The disciples, on the other hand, were drawn to the beauty and attractive things of the world. There is a reason for the Lord's coldness; He knew that the world would be destroyed. "Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness" (2 Pet. 3:11). Men love the world because they think that the world will last forever. Little do they realize that the heaven and the earth will be annulled. Blessed are those who understand 1 John 2:17!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 25</H2><P>Verse 3:"For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them." The foolish ones are foolish not because they have not prepared the oil. The failure to prepare the oil is only a manifestation of their foolishness.</P><P>Verse 4:"But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps." How troublesome it is to have another extra vessel! The world's tone is always, "Why bother to serve the Lord so seriously?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 26</H2><P>Verses 69-75:"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean. But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about! And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man! And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are. Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly." Perhaps Peter thought that it was better to deny the Lord and save his life for future use, rather than confess the Lord and lose his life then! Little did he realize that this was a mournful act (v. 75).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 27</H2><P>Verse 4:"Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!" Judas knew his sins but would not trust in the Lord's grace. This made him a "son of perdition."</P><P>Verse 18:"For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up." The sin of Pilate!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 6</H2><P>Verses 13-14:"Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power." Food and the stomach --both will perish. The Lord and the body --both have gone through or will go through resurrection.</P><P>Verse 15:"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!" Food and the stomach are joined as one. In the same way our body and the Lord are also joined as one; we are the members of His Body.</P><P>Verse 16:"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, `The two shall be one flesh.'" Those who are joined to a prostitute, like food joined to the stomach, will become one body with her.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 8</H2><P>Verses 1-2:"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know." Knowledge is versus love. Man has nothing to boast of concerning what he knows, for he still does not know what he ought to know. However, knowledge always puffs up, whereas love builds up. When there is love, one does not care for what he knows; rather, he takes care of others' ignorance and will not cause others to stumble through his own liberty.</P><P>Verse 3:"But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him." The greatest love is the love to God, and the greatest knowledge is to be known by God.</P><P>Verse 12:"And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ." Those who wound others have wounded Christ. To put it another way, those who love others love God. Those who love God have the real knowledge (v. 3). Hence, those who have caused others to stumble through their knowledge are not loving others; they do not love God, and they are void of knowledge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 9</H2><P>Verses 9-10:"For in the law of Moses it is written: `You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.' Is it for oxen that God cares? Or does He say it altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written because the plowman should plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking." This is the way to interpret the Old Testament.</P><P>Verse 19:"For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more." All those who truly love the Lord have such experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 10</H2><P>Verse 4:"And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ." "Followed them." Where God's people are, there is God's Christ also. Although they were wandering in the wilderness, He had not forsaken them. What grace this is!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_095.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_097.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 96</div><br></body></html>
