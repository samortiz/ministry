<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION<br />AND THE LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 11:25</h1><h2 class="head1">WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS</h2><p>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead. The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, "I will resurrect the dead." Instead, He said, "I am the resurrection." After He said these words, He resurrected a man. Both Martha and Mary were there on that day. To them, it would have been better for the Lord Jesus to say, "It does not matter that your brother has died; I can resurrect him." We like to hear this kind of word. Our desire and hope is that God will do something for us. We often pray, hope, and wait before God for a word concerning what He will do for us. But the Lord does not want to show us what He will do; He wants to show us what He is. What He can do is based on what He is. Martha believed in the Lord's power. She said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" (v. 21). Martha believed in God's power, and she also believed in the Lord Jesus' power, but she did not see that the Lord Himself is the resurrection and the life. We must see that everything God can do is included in what God is. The reason a man does not have God's power is that he does not know what God is. "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him" (Heb. 11:6). All the power that God has is based upon what He "is."</p><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus was not saying that He can preserve a man's life, but that He Himself is life. He was not telling us of His ability to resurrect men, but of the fact that He Himself is resurrection. May God open our eyes to see who the Lord is. We must see that in God's eyes, Christ is our everything. Once we have this kind of understanding, it is possible to have genuine growth in spiritual things. We must realize that in God's eyes, there is not any other object; the only object is Christ Himself! Whether or not we grow spiritually depends on whether we have truly touched spiritual reality. In other words, do we just know the individual things that God has done, or do we know God Himself?</p><p>John 11 does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected Lazarus. Instead it says that the Lord Jesus was resurrection to Lazarus. Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference? The Lord was resurrection to Lazarus, and then Lazarus was resurrected. The Lord did not give resurrection as a thing to Lazarus; He became resurrection to Lazarus. In other words, what the Lord does is only the appearance; what He is is the reality of the matter. We are not saying that the Lord did not resurrect Lazarus. We are saying that Lazarus resurrected because the Lord was resurrection to him.</p><p>We must remember that everything that God does in Christ is done in this principle. When the Lord is something to me, that something comes into existence. First He "is," then He "has." Many Christians separate the Grace-giver from the grace given by God. One day we will find out that the Grace-giver is the very gift given by God. God has not given us many things; He has only given us the Lord Jesus Himself. All spiritual things and all of God's gifts are but Christ Himself. God does not give us something piece by piece. God has given us Christ Himself. One day God will open our eyes to see that everything is in Christ. How wonderful it will be if we see this.</p><p>In declaring who He is, the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life." He is the resurrection. This is why His delaying did not cause a problem in the resurrection of Lazarus. In raising up Lazarus, the Lord was trying to lead men to the knowledge of Himself. The resurrection of Lazarus was not the greatest thing; the greatest thing is to know that the Lord Jesus is the resurrection. Many people believe that the Lord Jesus is the Life-giver. But it is altogether different to believe that the Lord Himself is life. He is not only the Life-giver; He is also the life. He is the Life-giver, and He is the life which He gives. He is not only the Lord who resurrects; He is resurrection itself. Once you see this, you will see that everything in Christ is living. God has only given Christ to man. We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord. He is the Grace-giver, and He is also the grace given. Our Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Resurrection and life encompass the whole Bible. It is wonderful to know the resurrection and the life. Let us now see what life is.</p>
