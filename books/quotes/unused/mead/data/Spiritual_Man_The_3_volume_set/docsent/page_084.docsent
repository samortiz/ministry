   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Soulish believers are touched easily.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes they are very excited and happy, while other times they are very depressed and sad.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When they are happy, it seems the world is too small to hold them, and they want to fly away to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when they are sad, it seems they are superfluous in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes they are extremely happy and stirred in their emotion, as if a fire were burning or a treasure had been found.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes when their heart is not burning, they suddenly have a feeling of loss and become dejected and unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their joy and their dejection depend on their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They do not have a living which is steady and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their joy and their grief govern their living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most soulish believers are over-sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are very difficult to deal with because they think everything around them is directed at them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they are slightly neglected, they become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They readily suspect that others' attitude toward them has changed; thus they become sorrowful, sad, and resentful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They can easily become intimate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They live in human affection to the extent that it becomes difficult for them to separate from others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is a slight change in such a relationship, it causes an unspeakable pain in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, they think this is to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God knows the weakness of the soulish believers they often are self-centered, thinking that they are very special when they have some spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, He often gives them special grace to enable them to have many extraordinary experiences, such as the feeling of joy and the feeling that the Lord is very near, very real, and touchable, in order that they may humble themselves and draw near to God who has given them the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, these believers do not act according to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not give glory to God and draw near to Him simply because He has given them grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, they utilize the grace of God as the basis of their own boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They think that they have received such grace simply because they are stronger than others and that since they have such experiences they are therefore more spiritual than others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Soulish believers mostly have sensuous joy and special experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these cause them to think that they are more spiritual than others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Little do they know that actually these are the evidences of their being soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spiritual ones are those who live by faith and not by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes it is not the feeling that causes the soulish believers to change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oftentimes their heart is divided by external affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People, things, and affairs in the world often invade their inner man, causing them to lose the peace in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you place a soulish believer in a joyful environment, he will be joyful, but if you place him in a difficult situation, he will be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lacks the power to create his own environment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He becomes red when he is close to vermilion, and he becomes black when he is close to ink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Soulish believers often live a kind of emotional life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the believers become spiritual, the Lord often enables them to feel His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Soulish believers delight in this kind of feeling the most.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they have such a feeling, they think that they have reached the supreme state and have made great strides on the way to spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although there are times that the Lord does not give them such a feeling, because they have not reached a complete life of faith, very often the Lord gives them the feeling of His presence in order to gradually train them not to rely on feelings but to depend on faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, they do not understand the intention of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They think that when they have such a feeling, their spiritual condition is at the highest point; otherwise, they think it is at the lowest.</S>
