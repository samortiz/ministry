   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SILENT TESTIMONY Issue No. 16 Scripture Reading: John 12:1-3, 9-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this passage we see Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What was Martha doing?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mary was doing the same thing she had been doing all the time, consecrating herself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What about Lazarus?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We think that he should have been doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Martha was loved by the Lord, Mary was loved by the Lord, and Lazarus was also loved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time Martha served the Lord, Mary consecrated herself to the Lord, and Lazarus just sat there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What did he accomplish by sitting there?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some Jews believed in the Lord because of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By merely sitting there, God received the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a sinner is saved, all he has to do is sit and Christ will get the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sitting is worshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times we cannot do much; we have nothing to offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All we can do is sit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps we cannot be involved specifically with services like Martha was.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps we cannot buy ointment to consecrate to the Lord like Mary did.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if we were dead and stinking, merely by sitting here today, we would be the expression of the Lord's power, the proof of the Lord's love, and the manifestation of the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have been dead, stinking, cold, and far away from the Lord; but today we are sitting here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not doing anything; we are not consecrating anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not even saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are just sitting here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While we are sitting here, we are reminders that the Lord has resurrected us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this alone, God gains the glory.</S>
