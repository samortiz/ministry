   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For a saint to practically receive the Lord's life and express this life on earth is a kind of training.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The experience of the birds and the aquatic creatures begins from the day that the life within them makes them a bird or an aquatic creature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From that day the birds and the aquatic creatures are able to live out their living and acquire experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This relates to the training of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of the Lord Jesus now is to train His saints in life.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man on earth is a representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man is God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This relates to the Lord Jesus' coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the last Adam and the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first Adam was a type of Him.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not rule over the world directly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, He has committed the authority to rule over the world to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus comes back again, He will set up the millennial kingdom on earth to rule over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as the creation of Adam in the preceding paragraph relates to the Lord's coming, the commissioning of Adam to rule over the world relates to His kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the millennium God will hand over all authority to Christ and cause Him to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Philippians 2:9 says, "Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many other Scriptures that speak of God giving authority to Christ to be the King over all things and to rule over all things in the millennium.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The birth, death, resurrection, ascension, and life-giving of the Lord Jesus are the crucial elements in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this is all that there is to His work, and if there is no second coming or reigning with Him, a Christian can only have hope in this age and will be poorer than all other men.</S>
