   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Epistles show us that the principle of offering is, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, God allows some to have lack so that the ones who have excess can be tested in their heart to see if they love the Lord and the brothers more than mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's test shows man what he is like.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a test does not show God anything; otherwise, He would be lowered to the same level as man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants us, the person, not our things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consecration is not mainly offering our possessions to God, but offering ourselves and our heart to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of consecration is acceptable and blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A foolish man thinks he earns all of his money by his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Little does he realize that he will earn nothing but trouble unless he operates according to God's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As believers we should live on earth by looking to God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without God's mercy, we cannot pass our days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostle told us not to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment 1 Tim 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Riches are uncertain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God who sits on the throne is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that we have problems, but we have the Lord, and He can take care of all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus told us that since God can feed all the birds in the air, He can surely feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In His eyes we are more precious than the birds Matt 6:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Except the Father wills it, a sparrow will not fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are more valuable than sparrows.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every hair of our head is numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has marked each one by number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not one will fall without His permission 10:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should do our best to offer up everything, and should not accumulate any excess.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FORSAKING EVERYTHING TO USHER IN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament God told the Israelites, "Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it" Mal 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we withhold what we should offer to God, God's church will be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we hold fast to what we have, how can we expect God to answer our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today there are two million people in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one tenth of the population were Christians, we would have two hundred thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church cannot receive the blessing of the power of God's gospel because we have held back the tithe which we owe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Throughout history, every time the church experienced a revival, there were men in the spirit of Pentecost who sold their all and forsook everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>J. N. Darby, Miss Groves, John Wesley, Count Zinzendorf, and many others took this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They chose the way of voluntary poverty and forsook everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result was great revivals in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Revelation 6 a white horse came forth when the Lord Jesus opened up the first of the seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The one who sat on the horse had a bow in his hand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 2 only speaks of a bow, but not an arrow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The arrow has been shot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason it says that he went forth conquering and to conquer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The white horse and its rider refer to the Lord's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord ascended in victory, the arrow was shot.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The result was much conquering and much more to conquer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we have the arrow in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not shoot it, the gospel will not continue in its victory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, only one church received praise from God the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Philadelphia is a recovery that comes after Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In name Sardis is living, but in reality it is dead; it has no power at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Philadelphia, however, has the power.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, it is a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where does its power come from?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Church history tells us that every time there is a revival, it is brought in through consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time the power goes away and the church becomes Sardis, it is because money has crept into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before he died, John Wesley said, "I am concerned for the Methodists.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are honest and frugal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the future they will become the richest people on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today his word has become a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Methodists everywhere are the richest people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet their testimony is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is true not only among the Methodists but also among the Moravians raised up at the time of Zinzendorf and the Brethren raised up at the time of J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A Christian must be fully rescued from money.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He must fully consecrate himself before he will know the meaning of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He must also continue in his consecration if he wants to stay away from Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do we want to be Philadelphia completely?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is simple to be a man living in the world; he only has one god mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, it is very troublesome to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is possible for him to have two gods mammon and God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a man wants to be a real Christian, a real consecrated one, he must be delivered from mammon Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brother Hwang said that it is easy to earn back the two mites that the widow dropped into the treasury, but I would say that at least that woman had the faith at the time to drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was not easy for her to offer even that little.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Unless our faith in God is strong, we will not dare to drop our coins into the treasury; they will remain hot in our hands for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In summary, God's requirement today is to forsake everything for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May we match God's present demand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May we not lower His demand, and may we give up everything for His sake and His gospel's sake.</S>
