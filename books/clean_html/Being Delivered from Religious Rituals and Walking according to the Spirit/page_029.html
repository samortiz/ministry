<h2 class="head1">THREE UNCHANGEABLE PRINCIPLES</h2>
<p>There are some basic principles that cannot be changed. In the Old Testament the children of Israel were commanded not to bow down to idols, and in the New Testament we are charged not to worship idols. This commandment concerns God&rsquo;s person. There is a commandment against worshipping idols. We should not say that we will not keep this commandment because we are in the New Testament. Once we remove this item, we violate the Godhead.</p>
<p>One of the Ten Commandments says that we should keep the Sabbath, and another commandment says that we should not commit adultery. When the Lord Jesus came, He broke the commandment concerning keeping the Sabbath, but instead of abolishing the commandment related to adultery, He strengthened it. The Old Testament charges us not to commit adultery, but the Lord Jesus charges us not to have even a lustful thought (Matt. 5:27-28). When the Pharisees asked why Moses commanded them to give a certificate of divorce, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so&rdquo; (19:7-8). Instead of abolishing the commandment concerning adultery, the Lord Jesus strengthened it.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we see that there is only one God; hence, man should not bow down to idols. Furthermore, God values man; hence, man should not commit adultery, murder, or steal. Since God values man, He does not allow anything that violates the basic rights of a human being. In the Old Testament God did not allow man to steal, and in the New Testament He does not allow man to steal. Fornication, stealing, extortion, and lying are not permitted among the children of God (1 Cor. 6:9-10; 5:9-11). These regulations were not abolished in the New Testament; instead, they are strengthened. God does not allow man to worship idols, because this offends His person, and He does not allow man to do anything that offends the rights of others. These two principles cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God never allows division among His children. For this reason, the New Testament says, &ldquo;A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse&rdquo; (Titus 3:10). God cares for the Body of Christ. God cares for Himself, man, and the church, which is the Body of Christ. God does not allow man to offend His person, to violate others&rsquo; rights, or to divide the Body of Christ. In the Old Testament God did not permit the children of Israel to establish a second worship center. They had only one center of worship, which was Jerusalem. God repeatedly charged the Israelites that when they entered the land of Canaan, they could not offer sacrifices and worship Him in the place of their choice; they had to go to the place designated by God (Deut. 12; 14&mdash;16). This was to keep the oneness among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s person, man&rsquo;s rights, and the oneness of the church are three matters that we must not offend or change. Besides these three matters, God does not care for anything else. We must take care not to worship an idol, which offends God&rsquo;s person, not to commit a sin that violates others&rsquo; rights, and not to form a division, which causes the Body of Christ to suffer loss.</p>
<p>There is another condition that we must take care of; we should not go against an explicit statement in the Bible. If the Bible says that we should be baptized only once, we should adhere to this. If there is no such statement, it is not necessary to establish an ordinance. On which day should we break the bread? Acts 20:7 says, &ldquo;On the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread,&rdquo; but in Acts 2:46 the disciples met and broke bread every day. When they first came into the church, many saints in Taiwan broke bread every Lord&rsquo;s Day evening. For this reason, to break bread on Lord&rsquo;s Day evening has become an ordinance. It may be that we will change this practice and break bread on Saturday morning. This would train us not to keep any ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING BOUND BY ORDINANCES<br />
BUT BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that instead of being bound by rituals and ordinances, we would be in our spirit. If a sister feels burdened to cover her head, she should cover her head. If she covers her head but does not have the burden to do so, it has become an ordinance to her. If I feel that I would like to be baptized again in order to bury my oldness, others should not criticize me. We do not have any rituals or ordinances; we only have the spirit. There is no formality in our meetings. We should not say that it is correct to be quiet or that it is correct to be loud, nor should we say that it is correct to sing a hymn first, pray first, or give a message first. We know only to follow the Spirit. What matters is that we are in spirit, not in ordinances. In order to avoid chaos and not be bound by ordinances, we must learn to exercise our spirit. Then we will be free in the spirit and will be the one Body.</p>
