<h2 class="head2">Going On in the Light of the Lord's Grace<br />(Kweilin)</h2><p>The church in Kweilin was led by the Lord to rent a meeting place on Sanhu Road. This was a piece of empty land in front of a brother's house. We built a hall there that can seat about a hundred twenty people. We finished it and moved in on May 8, 1949. The Lord gave us enough to pay for the labor, materials, and furniture. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Since the meeting hall was finished by grace, all of our service has been going on in the light of the Lord's grace.</p><p>The greatest lack in the church in Kweilin was leading ones. After the meeting hall was finished, the brothers and sisters prayed desperately that the Lord would send a useful person to lead us. Less than one month after the meeting hall was finished, the Lord sent His servant, our brother, Hou Sung-san, to Kweilin. He is mainly responsible for the work of giving messages. Thank the Lord.</p><p>There is a prayer meeting here every Thursday evening and a fellowship meeting every Saturday. We preach a message or the gospel every Lord's Day morning and have the Lord's table in the evening.</p><p>We had a seven-day conference in May 1950. The Lord released messages concerning being filled with the Holy Spirit through His servant Hou Sung-san. Many brothers and sisters received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and manifested the greatness of God. Glory to the Lord's name.</p><p>In 1949 we had three times of extensive gospel outreach. One time we passed out gospel tracts door-to-door to every house in the city of Kweilin. Thank God! The Holy Spirit did His work, and more than three hundred people repented and confessed the Lord's name. Fifty-nine were clearly saved and baptized into the Lord. This year we preached the gospel and nineteen people were baptized into the Lord. We baptized them in the river outside the Dingkweimen, and there were many spectators.</p><p>Some of the brothers and sisters have lost their jobs and are having difficulties making a living. We have organized a "Canaan Tofu Factory" that makes soybean milk each day and delivers it to government offices, schools, hospitals, and individual homes as they place orders. We also make tofu. Our pig-raising business is organized by Sister Chang Zhi-ping. She has accepted some of the unemployed brothers and sisters and given them a salary to live on. Although our factory is small, it does a good business.</p><p>We began the edification meetings for new believers this year. We divided them into Monday and Wednesday night groups because there were not enough to lead the meetings and many would have had to miss the meetings if there was only one meeting. One evening is for the younger ones who are able to take notes, and the other evening is for the older ones and those who do not read very well.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Lee Yuan-shan and<br />Hsieh Chang-san<br />January 9, 1951</p>
