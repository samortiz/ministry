   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THIRTY THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM 8 Scripture Reading: Luke 12:49-59 THE LORD S LONGING TO BE RELEASED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THROUGH DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 12:1-48 the Man-Savior warned His disciples of the hypocrisy of religion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-12 , covetousness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>13-34 , and concerning watchfulness and faithfulness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>35-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in 12:49-53 He expressed the longing to be released through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see that the Lord aspired to be fully released from the bondage of His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This short portion of the Word is very deep, and we need adequate spiritual experience in order to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was in Shanghai more than fifty years ago, I read a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks entitled The Release of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That book made reference to 12:49 and 50.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The writer pointed out that the Lord, in His incarnation was bound and concealed in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was God, and He had the divine life as His essence, strength, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, He was concealed in His humanity, which was a restriction to His divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, He needed to be released through death; that is, He desired that His divine being would be released through death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Luke 12:49 and 50 correspond to John 12:24: Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the Lord likens Himself to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a grain of wheat does not fall into the earth and die, it will abide alone and remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when it falls into the ground and dies, the death of that grain releases the life within it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say that death becomes a release to the inner life of the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through such a release, the riches of the life of the grain of wheat come forth to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and lost His soulish life through death so that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we compare John 12:24 with Luke 12:49 and 50, we see that both portions of the Scriptures describe the release of the divine life, or the release of the divine being of the Lord s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God, the Lord Jesus possessed the unlimited eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, this unlimited life was greatly restricted and restrained in His humanity, in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the Lord was anxious and desirous for the release of His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the divine life was released from within Him, He could impart it into His many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the basic thought in 12:49-53.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>COMING TO CAST FIRE ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 12:49 the Lord Jesus says, I came to cast fire on the earth, and what can I desire if it has already been kindled?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This fire is the impulse of the spiritual life, which comes from the Lord s released divine life and which causes the divisions mentioned in verses 51 through 53.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these verses we see that there will be divisions even in the families of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These divisions come from the fire which is the impulse of the spiritual life, and this impulse comes from the Lord s released divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His life was concealed, and the Lord wanted it to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wanted the fire to burst into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 49 the Lord says, What can I desire if it has already been kindled?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This part of the verse may also be rendered, How I wish that it were already kindled!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that the fire was not kindled before the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know from the record in the book of Acts that after the Lord s death this fire became a flame.</S>
