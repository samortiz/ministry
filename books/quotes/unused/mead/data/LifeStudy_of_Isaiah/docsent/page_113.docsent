   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah's Loving Word of Invitation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 45:20-25 we have Jehovah's loving word of invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. All the Ends of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Turning to Him and Being Saved</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there is the invitation to turn to Jehovah for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Turn to Me and be saved,/All the ends of the earth,/For I am God and there is no one else" v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every Knee Bowing to Him</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To Jehovah every knee will bow and every tongue will swear v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness and Strength Being Only in Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"It will be said of Me, Only in Jehovah/Is there righteousness and strength./To Him will men come,/And all those who are burning in anger against Him will be ashamed" v. 24 . Here righteousness refers to salvation, and strength refers to life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that in Jehovah we have salvation and life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who come to Him will be saved, but those who oppose Him will be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Jehovah All the Seed</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of Israel Being Justified and Glorying</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to verse 25, in Jehovah all the seed of Israel will be justified and will glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here to be justified is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Jehovah all the seed of Israel will be saved and will glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapters forty-one through forty-five, Isaiah gives us a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first forty chapters he unveiled in a hidden way God's economy, which is to have a people so that Christ as the embodiment of God can be expressed as everything, to be the centrality and the universality of everything in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God in Christ and Christ with God have reached this point, that is, to have Christ expressed as God's centrality and universality, to such an extent that Cyrus, a Gentile king, became one with Christ and that even pitiful Israel also became one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt Isaiah was one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah were one with Christ that God might have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who is one with Christ, including us, is a type of Christ because such persons are part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All who are part of Christ are types of Christ, who is the Servant of God, and they also are servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All other persons have been terminated, "fired," and put aside by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We who are one with Christ also have been fired by God, but unlike the unbelievers, we have been replaced with Christ to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, we who are one with Christ have become a great corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This corporate Christ is the same as the individual Christ in being the testimony and servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's economy is to have Christ processed for the divine purposes to be the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine dispensing is implied throughout the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the child born and the son given 9:6 is for the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To drink the water of God's salvation is to receive His dispensing 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The feast 25:6 with Christ as the canopy 4:5-6 to cover the entire situation is for the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into those who enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With Hezekiah in chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine we do not see anything of the divine dispensing, but we see much of this dispensing in chapter forty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a person realizes that he is nothing, that he is withering and fading, and that only God is everything and that only He abides forever, he is willing to come to the word of God to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regeneration by the living and abiding word of God 40:6-8 is the issue of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regeneration is actually a great dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were born of Adam to be temporal persons, but we have been regenerated to be eternal persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In regeneration, the Triune God dispenses Himself into us as life to make us eternal persons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regeneration is followed by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Becoming transformed persons who mount up with wings like eagles v. 31 is also a matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
