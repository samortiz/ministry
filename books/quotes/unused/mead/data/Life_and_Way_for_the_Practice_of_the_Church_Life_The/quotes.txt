[3]  On the one hand, we will cover the building up of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we will take care of the urgent need today among the Lord's children.
[4]  Now I want to help us see that throughout the Scriptures, there is the line of Christ with the church.
[5]  The first person we see is Christ Himself, the God-man, the Son of God incarnated as a man.
[6]  But when we get into the knowledge of Him, He would let us know that there is a need for us to know the church.
[7]  If you are one of those who, like Peter, know Christ as the Son of the living God, you have to realize the building up of the church.
[8]  Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is a part of Christ, even Christ Himself.
[9]  GOD'S DESIRE FOR THE CHURCH, THE BODY OF CHRIST
[10]  If we bring all these things to the Lord and spend some time to consider them, we will be clear about the position of the church in God's economy.
[11]  We will see that what God is looking for and what He is working for is the church, the Body of Christ.
[12]  Many of us have the realization that we need Christ as our life, but very few realize that Christ as our life is for us to practice the church life.
[13]  There have been many teachings about life the victorious life, the sanctified life, the exchanged life, the crucified life, the spiritual life, the divine life, the eternal life, and the life of Christ, the life of God.
[14]  By going through the whole Bible in this way we can see what is in God's plan, God's economy, God's arrangement, God's administration.
[15]  I wish to remind you of all the parables in Matthew 13.
[16]  Let me tell you a story as another example of the leaven added to the meal.
[17]  Five years ago some of us went to Jerusalem for a visit.
[18]  As we have mentioned in the previous chapter, the parables spoken by the Lord in Matthew 13 show us that the purpose, the intention, of the Lord in giving Himself to us as life is to bring forth the church as His Body.
[19]  They also show us how the enemy has come in to frustrate the Lord's purpose by damaging, spoiling, and corrupting the Body of Christ.
[20]  First Corinthians 3 tells us that the church is, on the one hand, God's cultivated land, and on the other hand, God's building v. 9 . On the one hand, we have to grow as God's farm by the life which is Christ Himself as the seed sown into us.
[21]  When we know the way to take Christ as life, day by day we will be filled with Christ, occupied with Christ, and saturated with Christ.
[22]  Brothers and sisters, the church life needs the real growth in life and the transformation by the life of Christ.
[23]  I do not feel that I need to talk a lot about how Christ is life to us.
[24]  Christ is the life and reality of the church.
[25]  Now we need to know the right way, even the best way, for us to apply and experience Christ as life to us.
[26]  However, before we get into this matter, we need to find out what Christ is.
[27]  If we want to apply Christ as life to our experience in our daily life, we need to know what kind of Christ He is.
[28]  Now let us turn to the third chapter of 2 Corinthians.
[29]  In verses 16 through 17 He said, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."
[30]  Then in verse 11, he changed again from Christ to the Spirit, saying, "And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[31]  The Son is the center with the Father in Him, and He is the Spirit.
[32]  AS THE INNER LIFE LIGHT, THE SPIRIT, FELLOWSHIP, JOY,
[33]  First John 1:1-4 says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us ; that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[34]  Although we have a physical life, a natural life, a human life by birth, God's intention is that we take Christ as our life.
[35]  We are so used to living by the natural life which we already have, yet today God wants us to give up, to put away, to put aside, this natural life and take Christ as our life.
[36]  What is the way to take Christ as life?
[37]  You have to be clear about several things before you can be clear about the way to take Christ as your life.
[38]  First, you have to realize that today Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b .
[39]  If we are going to take Christ as life, we have to know that Christ today is the Spirit and this Spirit is now mingled with our spirit as one spirit.
[40]  If you do not have this flowing within, you are a dead person; you are a false Christian, not a genuine one.
[41]  If you are a genuine Christian, I am sure something within you is flowing all the time.
[42]  In 2 Corinthians 13:14 we have the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[43]  The Holy Spirit is the fellowship, the transmission, transmitting all the riches of Christ, all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ, into us.
[44]  If you sense darkness within you, you should realize that you are not taking Christ as life; you are out of the experience of Christ as life.
[45]  If you take Christ as life, you must have the shining within you because the life is the light, and Christ Himself is the light of life.
[46]  Just before I came here this evening, around suppertime, I was with the Lord considering the message tonight.
[47]  If you are one who takes Christ all the time as life, you will not joke, because the life of Christ is not a joking life.
[48]  One time a brother was going to do a certain work for the Lord, yet he realized that the inner regulating was demanding him to stop the work.
[49]  However, he had the intention and the desire to do it.
[50]  Philippians 1:19 says, "For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[51]  Here it is not just the Spirit of Jesus but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[52]  Sometimes when you experience the Spirit working and moving in you, you sense some kind of killing going on within you, even though you may not have heard any message or teaching about the killing of the cross.
[53]  Because you experience the Spirit of Jesus working in you, you sense something within killing your poor character, your bad habits, your temper, your desires, your lusts, and a lot of other things.
[54]  This is the effectiveness of the death of Christ included in the Spirit of Jesus.
[55]  You may not have known that the resurrection life of Christ is within you today, but if you have the experience of the Spirit of Christ, you have the element of the resurrection power that is in Him.
[56]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE THE LIVING LAW WITHIN US
[57]  Hebrews 8:10-11 says, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them." Notice in verse 10 that laws in the plural number is used.
[58]  The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is simply Christ Himself, because verse 10 says, "But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness."
[59]  I am concerned that many of you may be very good, yet you are wrong with the Spirit.
[60]  You may work for God today, preach the gospel, do a lot of things to build up the churches, and even give what you have to help others.
[61]  But I would ask you, "Are you right with the Spirit in you?"
[62]  Even though we love the Lord, we still act apart from Him most of the time.
[63]  In our daily living and walk, we are like Peter before the Lord's resurrection.
[64]  At that time he did not live by Christ, walk in the Spirit, and take Christ as life, strength, and power for his service to God.
[65]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF GOD Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; Eph 2:15-16, 19; Col 3:10; Eph 4:22
[66]  The point which we are going to cover in this chapter is more important than all the other points covered in the previous chapters.
[67]  I would ask you to exercise not only the understanding of your mind but also the apprehending ability of your spirit, so that the Holy Spirit may reveal to you something eternal.
[68]  This wonderful Spirit who is Christ Himself is going to transform us absolutely into Christ with Christ.
[69]  You are the "ball," and this wonderful Spirit of Christ, who is Christ Himself, is the "red ink."
[70]  We need to see and know that God's purpose, God's intention, is to have the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ come into us as everything that He may permeate us, saturate us, and transform us into Christ with Christ.
[71]  If you are saturated by Christ, you are in Christ and have been swallowed up by Christ to express Christ.
[72]  The subject of this book is the life and way for the practice of the church life.
[73]  Christ Himself is the life, and He is the Spirit in us.
[74]  Today the Body life, the church life, is Christ Himself realized as the Spirit and dwelling in us.
[75]  The only thing you need is to realize that you have this wonderful Spirit within you as the reality of Christ, as the fullness of the Godhead, and as everything to you.
[76]  I do have the assurance in these days that the Lord is going to recover the experience of Christ as life and the way to practice the church life so that Christ may have a living expression through His Body in many localities.
[77]  CHAPTER NINE TRANSFORMATION BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 16, 29; 12:1-2, 4-5; 2 Cor 3:17-18 OUR NEED TO SET OUR MIND ON THE SPIRIT
[78]  In this chapter we want to fellowship about our need to be transformed by the Spirit.
[79]  Within our spirit we have the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit, but without we have something awfully troublesome.
[80]  You may feel that several brothers are good brothers.
[81]  When Christ received gifts in the heavens, He received them in man, as man.
[82]  But if you realize that you have been crucified with Christ and apply that death to yourself, this will cause you to have more of Christ and will make you a bigger part of Christ.
[83]  The real gifts for the building up of the Body of Christ are the persons who have been worked on by Christ in such a way that they are saturated and permeated with Christ so that they become the great parts of Christ.
[84]  Now we need to see the way to perfect the saints.
[85]  The gifted persons need to minister Christ to others.
[86]  They have to help others realize Christ, know Christ, experience Christ, and grow in Christ.
[87]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE GROWTH AND THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2-5; 1 Cor 3:7-13, 16-17; Eph 2:21-22; 4:13-16
[88]  The burden of this book is to show the Lord's children that in these last days the Lord is going to recover this one thing, that is, Christ being wrought into the believers in order to be mingled with them, and all the believers being transformed in nature, in essence, in element, and in their very human substance into the image of Christ.
[89]  Then we will become the many parts of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ, the living expression of Christ.
[90]  The church as the Body of Christ is something growing up in Christ and into Christ.
[91]  Brothers and sisters, allow me to tell you humbly but frankly that you do not need any kind of forms, rituals, regulations, rules, charters, constitutions, etc. What you need is the living Christ.
[92]  OF THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:1-2; Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 14:33; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11; 1 Cor 1:12-13; 3:4-8, 21-23; 4:1, 6; Acts 28:30-31
[93]  Now let us read Revelation 1:11: "Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."
[94]  Verse 20 says, "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
[95]  We have seen that God's eternal goal is to work Christ Himself into us that we may be the real parts of Christ as the living members of the Body of Christ, which is the church as the living expression of Christ.
[96]  Now we come to the second factor of divisions, which is related to having specialties.
[97]  The divisions came into being because of the saints' having something special.
[98]  According to church history, it is clear that soon after the time of the early apostles, the church deviated from the right track.
[99]  Now I want to add a little word concerning the relationship among the co-workers.
[100]  Another thing which we, the workers, have to be careful about and which was mentioned already in the preceding chapter is that we should not keep any of the results of our work in our hands.
[101]  Also, as a worker, as a servant of the Lord, wherever you go you should not impose anything on the saints and on the local churches.
[102]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-8, 11-15, 17-18, 20-22, 26-27; 14:22-23; 15:19-20; 16:16-17
[103]  In this chapter we will go on to see something in more detail concerning the way for the practice of the church life.
[104]  Deuteronomy is a book which shows the proper way for the children of Israel as God's people, after their entrance into the land of Canaan, to have a life, a walk, or a living according to God's mind which would be well pleasing to God Himself.
[105]  This typifies that God has delivered us out of the world, out of the authority of the darkness of Satan, and transferred us into Christ v. 13 . Now we are walking, living, working, and worshipping and serving God in Christ 2:6 .
[106]  If we labor on Christ and work together with Christ, we will have many things produced out of Christ as food to us for our enjoyment, and we will have a surplus of Christ.
[107]  This means that when we enjoy Christ with God as our worship to God in the fellowship of His children, we have to be in the unique place ordained by God the place of the oneness of God's children.
[108]  Hence, it is clear that for us to enjoy Christ personally is one thing, and for us to enjoy Christ with others as a worship to God is another thing.
[109]  This signifies that for our personal enjoyment, we can enjoy Christ in any place at any time, but if we are going to enjoy Christ as our worship to God in fellowship with the other saints, we have to be careful because it affects our oneness.
[110]  Then another Hebrew will hear about what we are doing, and he will decide to gather some of his neighbors to do the same thing.
[111]  Eventually, the people of Israel will be automatically and spontaneously divided, and there will be no end to their divisions.
[112]  Whenever we come together to worship God in sharing Christ in fellowship with one another, we have to come with something of Christ.
[113]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN ONENESS AND CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5, 8, 11, 13, 27; 14:22-23
[114]  I would like to stress again the type of the living of God's people in the good land.
[115]  Do you believe that all the members of the church are wonderful persons?
[116]  It seems that the members of the Body, the saved ones, are peculiar people.
[117]  Now we come to the second main thing in the living of God's people in the good land, and that is Christ.
[118]  When you come as an Israelite to worship God, you have to bring the produce of the land of Canaan.
[119]  When the early Christians came together, do you believe they came with predestination, with Calvinism, or with Arminianism?
[120]  Rather, they came with the Christ whom they experienced and offered to God as the burnt offering for God's satisfaction and as the heave offering, as the One who has accomplished everything and ascended to the heavens.
[121]  Everyone of us has to experience Christ daily so that whenever we come to the meeting we come with something of Christ.
[122]  The building of the church depends on our offering of Christ, and our offering of Christ in the meetings depends on our experiences of Christ in our daily life.
[123]  The proper way for us to practice the church life is to respect the oneness and to experience Christ in order to have a surplus of Christ to bring to the church to share with the saints in the worship of God so that God can be satisfied with Christ and enjoy Christ with us.
[124]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN ONENESS AND CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 133 THE WAY TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE
[125]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the need to keep the oneness and experience Christ for the practice of the church life.
[126]  We also need the reality, which according to Psalm 133 includes the oil, the dew, and the life.
[127]  Whenever we come together, we must have the all-inclusive Christ as the Spirit moving and working through us and among us.
[128]  When we live in Christ throughout our daily living, we come to the meetings with part of Christ, and that part of Christ is a part of the anointing oil.
[129]  There are two things that spoil the church life.
