<h2 class="head3">The Boards of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The boards of the tabernacle were standing boards (Exo. 26:15). The tabernacle was a portable structure that could be taken apart, freely moved, and then assembled together again. Everything related to the tabernacle was portable. Forty-eight standing boards framed the tabernacle, or the Tent of Meeting. In the type of the tabernacle there are several important aspects related to the significance of the boards.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Having Two Natures</h2>
<p>Each board consisted of acacia wood overlaid with gold. As wood overlaid with gold, they had two natures (Exo. 26:29; cf. 25:10-11; 36:36). Gold signifies the nature of God. The nature of God is related to the life of God, which is God Himself. Hence, gold denotes God Himself. In typology wood refers to the human nature. The overlaying of the wood with gold signifies that the church is the mingling of God and man; hence, the church is an entity composed of two natures.</p>
<p>Acacia wood is strong in character and high in standard, signifying the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. The Lord&rsquo;s humanity is strong and noble. We should never think that we have an excuse not to be proper in the church because we are weak. In fact, every genuinely saved one should be acacia wood to the degree that their humanity has been worked on by God.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when the man Adam was created, he was both solid and strong; he was truly acacia wood. His thoughts were clear, his judgment was accurate, his will was strong, and his emotions were rich and proper. However, after Satan attacked man, man sinned and fell, and his humanity was ruined and gradually became dark and weak. The entire human race became darkened and ignorant. In contrast, after we believed into the Lord, God&rsquo;s salvation not only saved us from sin and the attraction of the world, but also began to remake and reconstitute our entire being.</p>
<p>The material that God uses to remake us is higher than the material He used in creating us. When God created man, He used the dust of the ground, but when He remakes us, He uses the divine nature, typified by gold. In other words, He adds Himself into us. Hence, after a person is saved, there should be a change not only in his behavior but also in his character. After salvation, one who lacked a clear mind should have a clear mind, one who had a weak will should have a strong will, and one whose discernment was improper should have a proper discernment.</p>
<p>Acacia wood is high in quality. In His salvation, God wants to save man to a high standard. Sadly, it seems that God&rsquo;s salvation has not been manifested much among the saints. Although we are saved, our character has not been uplifted. Those who lack a clear mind remain the same. Likewise, those with a weak will remain the same, and those with an improper discernment remain the same. In our daily life we are neither accurate in our speech nor precise in our timing; moreover, we are neither genuine nor strict. After our initial salvation, we have not allowed the life of God to operate in us. Even though we are saved, we do not realize that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to remake us and to change our character. We think that the purpose of God&rsquo;s life in us is to change our behavior. Formerly we frequently lost our temper, but because of God&rsquo;s life in us, we do not lose our temper as much. Consequently we think that this is sufficient, and we are satisfied. However, we fail to realize that the purpose of God&rsquo;s life in us is to change our natural character.</p>
<p>We have urged the saints to train their character, but few brothers and sisters have experienced much of a change in their character. This proves that God&rsquo;s life has not had much of an effect upon them. It is not sufficient merely to pray; we must also allow the Spirit and the life of God to operate in us. Even if we should refrain from speaking negative things, we still must speak with full assurance and accuracy. Our character must be uplifted and strengthened. Whatever we do must be excellent and outstanding. We need to change from decayed wood to acacia wood. This is accomplished in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we have not been saved in the matter of our character, we will not be able to discern the truth in the Bible because our character will not be exact. Our character must be genuine, exact, and strict. The kind of Bible we have depends on the kind of person we are. A sloppy person reads the Bible in a sloppy way, whereas an exact person reads the Bible in an exact way. This is a matter of character. This is not only true with the reading of the Bible but also in regard to our service in the church. Without a change in our character, everything we do will be careless and sloppy. As a result, we will not be of much use in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. In serving the Lord, we must allow our redeemed humanity to be uplifted.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle, acacia wood typifies the humanity that cooperates with God, the humanity that is high in standard, rather than a fallen humanity. Whenever we serve, we need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is our serving according to acacia wood or decayed wood? Is the way that we determine, handle, arrange, and do things solid and exact, or is it casual and sloppy?&rdquo; We do not realize how fallen our nature is. We need to be saved to see our own condition and to train our character. The humanity in the church must be acacia wood.</p>
<p>Some people are not exact in their speaking and in their use of time. They are sloppy in handling matters, but when they pray, they pray fervently. As a result, people think they are spiritual. This kind of person should not use prayers to utter empty words but rather to overturn his character. He should kneel down before the Lord and pray: &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me. Thoroughly change my loose character.&rdquo; In this way, his character will be changed from decayed wood to acacia wood, and the church will be strengthened.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the boards, not because of the gold. Gold is precious, but gold is soft and cannot stand on its own. The tabernacle could stand only by means of the boards. Throughout the past two thousand years of church history, the church has been able to stand because of her strong human element. Martin Luther was a strong person. He was acacia wood, and as such, he was able to stand for the Reformation. In 1942 I bought a biography of Brother George M&#252;ller. The book contained a picture of his study. From the picture I saw the fine and neat arrangement of his study, and I was filled with admiration. Consequently, God gave M&#252;ller a particular commission for the age in which he lived because he was solid, exact, and strict. He was truly a piece of acacia wood.</p>
<p>If there are many such people in the church, the church will be able to stand strongly. It is true that the boards of the tabernacle were overlaid with gold, but the firmness of boards was due to the firmness of the acacia wood. The reason that many local churches are weak is that the brothers and sisters are weak in their humanity; that is, they lack the acacia wood. In God&rsquo;s eyes, a spiritual person is not a person without humanity but one whose humanity matches God. God is seeking spiritual men in whom there is no lack in their human element and in whom their humanity matches divinity. Instead of being independent of or detached from God, our humanity must match God and be mingled with God.</p>
<p>A basic principle in God&rsquo;s redemption is that God desires man to match Him. Paul had a strong character. Madame Guyon, though she was a sister, also had a very strong character. Likewise because of their strong character, John Bunyan bore a good testimony for the Lord, and J. N. Darby was greatly used by the Lord. They were acacia wood, strong and firm, and thus were able to stand and bear a glorious testimony for the Lord. If we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, we must allow God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s Spirit to operate in us. Our character can be compared to cement; we must allow the water of the Holy Spirit to mingle with us so that the cement of our character can solidify and become firm. When our character is firm, we can be useful in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the stable base of the silver sockets, but it still needed the firm acacia wood as support. Today the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and a firm humanity. We should not have an erroneous concept that everything depends on who God is and what He does and that nothing is related to man or required of man. God cannot establish a strong church by calling and gathering together a group of young children. They could not possibly be used to establish a strong church because their humanity is not mature. Likewise, if there were only divinity but not humanity, there would be no possibility of establishing a strong church. Divinity is supported by humanity. Hence, there must be a strong humanity in order for the church to stand. The church is wood overlaid with gold. As saved ones, we have God within and the flesh without. However, the boards of the tabernacle show that the divinity, gold, was on the outside, and that humanity, acacia wood, was on the inside. Divinity was supported by humanity. The standing part was the acacia wood, and the expressed part was gold. At the time of the Reformation, Luther was standing, but he expressed gold. He was expressing God. This is the principle of wood overlaid with gold. Whether the church is strong or weak has a great deal to do with humanity. Therefore, we should not think that the church will be strong once we have some biblical knowledge and are spiritual. Strong humanity produces a strong church. The picture regarding the boards of the tabernacle shows that the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and strong humanity.</p>
