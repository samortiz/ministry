   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD TESTAMENT SHOWING TYPES,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE NEW TESTAMENT SHOWING THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the prophets in the Old Testament typify the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit, the anointing ointment, has entered into us personally and directly to be our Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The law in the Old Testament represents and declares the nature of God s life, which is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the nature of God s life has entered into us directly, so there is no longer any need for an outward law to declare it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament everything was a shadow, a type, a representation, but in the New Testament the reality has come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sacrificial lamb in the Old Testament typified the Lord Jesus; in the New Testament the Lord Jesus has come, so there is no need for a type.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Similarly, the law in the Old Testament declared the nature of God s life; in the New Testament the nature of God s life has entered into us directly so that the outward law is no longer needed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament the representatives through whom the Holy Spirit gave revelations were the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today the Spirit of revelation, typified by the prophets, is in us, and the Spirit gives us revelations directly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need of any representative.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything in the Old Testament, in principle, is also in the New Testament, but there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, the Old Testament required the shedding of blood for the expiation of sins; the New Testament also requires the shedding of blood for the redemption of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in the Old Testament the blood that was shed for the expiation of sins was through a type, whether it was a lamb or a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the New Testament the reality of the type, Christ, has come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament the law, as the declaration of the nature of God s life, regulated man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament the principle is the same, but we are regulated by the law of God s life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament the law was a representation; in the New Testament God s life in us is the reality of what is represented by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle of God s giving revelation to people is the same in the New Testament as in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament the prophets, as the representatives of the Holy Spirit, gave revelations to people; in the New Testament however, the Holy Spirit has entered into the believers directly to give us revelations, so there is no need of prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle in the Old Testament is the same as in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who carried out the principle in the Old Testament, however, were not the reality but were merely types.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament the reality Christ has come, so there is no need of types such as bulls or lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When life comes, there is no need of the law of letter; when the Holy Spirit comes, there is no need of prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>KNOWLEDGE IMPARTED TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THROUGH THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of knowledge is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult to find a book in Christian bookstores that says that the purpose of the law is for us to know the nature of God s life and that the prophets are for us to know God in His infiniteness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hardly any book speaks of the Holy Spirit in us replacing the prophets of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The light concerning the law of life replacing the law in the Old Testament was seen by God s children one hundred or even two hundred years ago, but the light concerning the Holy Spirit replacing the prophets of the Old Testament has not been seen until today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of spiritual light is not that easy to see.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The knowledge that the law of life gives us is different from the knowledge that we receive from the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything related to the nature of God s life is made known to us through the law of life; everything related to God s infinite self is made known to us through the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, when we purchase some fabric, the colors and patterns we choose are related to our Christian conduct, which is a reflection of God s nature; hence, this is a matter of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we may also have a sense within us as to whether we should buy one or two pieces of fabric or whether we should buy five or twenty yards of fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is made known to us by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, not the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit as the anointing is absolutely related to the Holy Spirit as the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, a brother may want to see a movie, but he does not know which movie to see.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He may seek the anointing to get a sense of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since he wants to see a movie, he prays, O Lord, I do not know which movie is good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please give me a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, the anointing teaches me concerning all things, and I have no need that anyone teach me, so please give me a leading, that I may know which movie to see.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Holy Spirit will never give him a sense in response to such a request because the anointing is based on the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Holy Spirit will not act as the anointing if we desire to do something that is against the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The knowledge that we receive from the law of life is always strengthened by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two interact as both cause and effect.</S>
