<p>I am glad that during the last ten months the Lord has released the matter of the high peak of the divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures. Recently, I wrote in Chinese a hymn on God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature. Many saints are beside themselves with joy when they sing this hymn. It is very difficult to translate this hymn into English. The following is a literal translation:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>How great a miracle! How deep a mystery!<br />
God and man are joined and blended as one!<br />
God becomes man and man becomes God,<br />
An economy incomprehensible to angels and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mankind;<br />
Out of God&rsquo;s pleasure, in His love,<br />
Attaining the highest purpose of God.<br /><br /></li>
<li>God incarnated to be a God-man,<br />
In order that I may become God,<br />
In life and nature the same kind as He,<br />
Having no share in His Godhead;<br />
His attributes become my virtues,<br />
His glorious image livingly expressed through me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>It is no longer I living alone,<br />
But God and I living together;<br />
Coordinated with the saints in God<br />
To be built up as the universal house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Divine Trinity<br />
And to become the organic Body of Christ<br />
As a great corporate vessel for Him to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;express Himself.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Ultimately, the holy city, Jerusalem,<br />
The aggregate of visions and revelations,<br />
The Triune God and the tripartite man<br />
To be the couple in love in eternity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as man yet God;<br />
The mutual habitation of divinity and humanity<br />
With God&rsquo;s glory shining forth radiantly in man.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following is a translation of this hymn in poetry to the tune of #499 in <em>Hymns:</em></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>What miracle! What mystery!<br />
That God and man should blended be!<br />
God became man to make man God,<br />
Untraceable economy!<br />
From His good pleasure, heart&rsquo;s desire,<br />
His highest goal attained will be.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Flesh He became, the first God-man,<br />
His pleasure that I God may be:<br />
In life and nature I&rsquo;m God&rsquo;s kind,<br />
Though Godhead&rsquo;s His exclusively.<br />
His attributes my virtues are;<br />
His glorious image shines through me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>No longer I alone that live,<br />
But God together lives with me.<br />
Built with the saints in the Triune God,<br />
His universal house we&rsquo;ll be,<br />
And His organic Body we<br />
For His expression corp&rsquo;rately.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Jerusalem, the ultimate,<br />
Of visions the totality;<br />
The Triune God, tripartite man&mdash;<br />
A loving pair eternally&mdash;<br />
As man yet God they coinhere,<br />
A mutual dwelling place to be;<br />
God&rsquo;s glory in humanity<br />
Shines forth in splendor radiantly!<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>According to this hymn, it is a great miracle and a deep mystery that God has a way to be joined to man and mingled with man. God became man that man may become God. Such an economy is incomprehensible to both angels and man. This economy is of God&rsquo;s desire, and it will reach, attain, the high peak of God&rsquo;s goal. Ultimately the holy city, Jerusalem, will be the aggregate of all the visions and revelations throughout the Scriptures. The Triune God and the tripartite man will become a loving couple in eternity as man yet still God. Divinity and humanity will become a mutual abode, and the glory of God will be expressed in humanity radiantly in splendor to the uttermost.</p>
<p>I hope that the saints in all the churches throughout the earth, especially the co-workers and the elders, will see this revelation and then rise up to pray that God would give us a new revival&mdash;a revival which has never been recorded in history.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
