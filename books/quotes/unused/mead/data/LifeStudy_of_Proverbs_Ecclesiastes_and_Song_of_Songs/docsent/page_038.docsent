   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Terminating the Fallen Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that man has become fallen and needs to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's redemption the first part is to terminate, to destroy, the fallen old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rescuing the Humanity Created by God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second part is to rescue what was created by God, the God-created humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Something remains of the humanity created by God, and God is not willing to give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He created it, and although it has become fallen, He will maintain it and bring it back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, in His redemption, God, on the one hand, destroys what is fallen and, on the other hand, rescues what was created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Uplifting the Redeemed Part of Created Man</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the third part of His redemption, God uplifts the redeemed God-created humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes when a certain thing which we have made becomes lost and damaged, we find that thing and repair it, making it better than it was originally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what God has done in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He made the man created by Him better than he was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that God uplifted the redeemed humanity by dispensing Himself into it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The God-created humanity was very good, but it did not have anything of God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was only human, without divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this humanity became fallen, in His redemption God destroyed the fallen part, rescued the God-created part, and then dispensed Himself into this redeemed humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At this juncture we need to point out that, according to the Bible, God's redemption includes not only death but also resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without resurrection, God could not bring back to Himself the lost created man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To bring back the lost God-created man is actually to resurrect the God-created man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In resurrection God used His own life, nature, and element as the substance to uplift the redeemed created man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, in resurrecting the dead humanity, God put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now this man is regenerated and uplifted, having all that God is within him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire God has entered into this resurrected, regenerated, and uplifted man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This man is what the Bible calls the new man Eph 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention is no longer with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the sight of God, the old man has been finished, terminated, and thus he no longer exists.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His redemption God's eyes are always on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to see this.</S>
