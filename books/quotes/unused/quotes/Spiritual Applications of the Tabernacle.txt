Exodus 25:1-31:11 contains the revelation of God to Moses concerning all the matters of the tabernacle and His service
Since Gods word on the Sabbath was written as the conclusion of all the revelations in the preceding chapters it must surely be significant
Man was the final item of God's creation and was created on the sixth day, probably toward the end of the sixth day
The parable in Luke 151132 indicates that without the prodigal son returning home the father could not rest at his table to enjoy the feast
We, as the redeemed ones, as the spiritual Israel , have to realize that everything has been accomplished by God
Certain Christians, according to their natural concept, insist on keeping the Old Testament Sabbath, the seventh day
The Ten Commandments were not merely a law given by God to test the people of Israel, but were the testimony of God Himself
They worshipped the golden calf and in doing so they broke the first aspect of the testimony of the law that is that God is the unique God
In this way they also broke the second aspect of the law, that is, that God is a God of holiness and righteousness
They sinned by making and worshipping a graven image and by conducting themselves in a way that was contrary to God's nature
It was not merely Moses who broke the tablets at the foot of the mountain ; it was the people of Israel who had broken the testimony already
All these things concerning the children of Israel were written as examples to us and are therefore types which we must apply
On the one hand, we testify that the Lord is the unique God, and on the other hand, we testify of the nature of the Lord
We must be heavenly, spiritual, holy, and righteous because the nature of the Lord is heavenly, spiritual, holy, and righteous
Not very long after the apostles' time, the church, like the children of Israel, broke the entire testimony of the Lord
Today's celebration of Christmas is an example of the name of Christ being used for the purpose of idolatry and human pleasure
The Levites were the overcomers who stood with Moses for the Lords testimony to express that they did not go along with the idol worshippers
They were separated from the people to testify that the Lord was the supreme One, the one God, and that He was holy and righteous
They could not tolerate the idol worship and the looseness, so they purified themselves, and by doing so they gained the priesthood
God's intention was to have the whole nation of Israel as His priests , but by breaking God's testimony they lost the priesthood
Exodus 337 says Now Moses would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting
Before this time the tent of Moses was always within the camp because the presence of the Lord was in the midst of the people of Israel
If the people would not go out of the camp but would remain in it, they would not have the presence of the Lord
Exodus 33:11 is the first verse in the Scripture which says that the Lord spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks to a companion
In order to have the presence of the Lord and the fellowship with the Lord, one had to leave the camp and be in the tent
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, there was a separation between the Jewish people, the camp, and the Lord Himself, the real tabernacle
In Matthew 158 the Lord said regarding the Jewish religionists This people honors Me with their lips but their heart stays far away from Me
The Lord took the tent and pitched it outside of Judaism, and there became a separation between Him and those within Judaism
From this separation the church came into being, for after His forsaking of the house of Israel, He turned to another people
Later, Christianity also became the camp, taking the name of the Lord but not worshipping the Lord in spirit and truthfulness
The Lord's presence left all the camps, and all those who really seek the Lord have to leave the camp, go out of the camp unto the Lord
The service to God and of God, the genuine service, the real service to the Lord, must be something built up by the people of God
Not only the building, the house of God, has to be built by the people of God, but even the service to God has to be built up by us
If we have no experience of the spiritual life, we will have nothing with which to build, and we will not know how to build
We must have the material and the gifts with which to build, and we must have the wisdom, the way, to know how to build
The dwelling place of God, the service of God, and the fellowship with God have to be built up by the experiences of the Lord's children
All these materials offered by the people of Israel represent the things of Christ which were experienced by the people of God
The things experienced and possessed by them they now brought to offer to God to be the material for the building
Without the experiences of God's divine life and nature, we would have nothing to offer to God for His building
When the divine life and nature become our experience, we have something to offer to the Lord as material for His building
Blue represents heavenliness, purple represents authority and kingship, and scarlet represents redemption, the redeeming power
They represent the enduring power, strength, and energy of Christ to suffer all kinds of attacks during His human life on earth
The weaving materials are mainly for the fellowship because these materials pertain mostly to the priestly garments
Silver represents the redemption of the cross while bronze represents the judgment and the testing of God and even the trials from the enemy
If we are going to have God's building built among us, each one of us must have the proper human nature or character
The renewed humanity, signified by the strong and durable acacia wood, is the material for the building of God
Oil, representing the Holy Spirit, is for anointing, and spices, representing the resurrection of Christ, are for the incense
These things need to be experienced by the people of God so that they may possess all these things as their wealth
When the Lord had need of these items in Exodus, the people had them to offer to Him as the material for His building
By this we know that for the building of the Lord both the material and the workmanship must be something of Christ which we experience
Verse 24a continues, 'Everyone who offered a heave offering of silver and bronze brought the heave offering of Jehovah'
After the completion of the renewing of the new man and the building up of His Body, eternity future will begin
The Christ in whom we believe, whom we receive as our life and we enjoy as our all, is the Christ who has ascended to the heavens
The articles of gold in verse 22 are the ornaments worn on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, neck, and arms
Whenever we come together and a brother or a sister offers a prayer or gives a testimony, we may say that they are waving a wave offering
All the beauties of God's divine nature which are manifested upon us must be something alive, something living and full of life
When we love a brother or do something in the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus, there is the beauty of life full of 'motion'
Because we experience the divine life and nature, we have the surplus of the divine life and nature as the wealth in our hands
The second item of the offerings is the coverings, whether for the covering of the tent or for the clothing for the priests
In this way all these characteristics will be a covering to the Lord's people, who should be the priests serving God
The coverings were woven of these materials, which are the various heavenly aspects and characteristics of Christ
If you are going to be one with authority among the Lord's children, you have to have something to offer to the Lord as precious stones
To have something of the precious stones means that in your life in your spiritual experience you have suffered the burning and the pressure
The spices and the oil represent Christ resurrected and ascended to God and coming down to visit people to enable people to serve God
Only when one has the deeper and further experiences of Christ as the precious stones could he offer the spices and the oil
All these are the items of the offerings and are called the heave offering, something of the ascended and heavenly Christ
The aspects and characteristics of Christ typified by the weaving materials have to be experienced by us in a very detailed way
These characteristics of Christ will be subjectively 'spun' into us, and Christ will be wrought into our being in our experience
We need to spend our energy to labor on these things so that they will all become something belonging to us as our wealth
The experience of the weaving materials is more subjective than the experiences of the silver, the bronze, and even the acacia wood
The precious stones were offered for the fellowship of God with His people, while the oil and spices were offered for the service to God
The precious stones were materials for the breastplate and the ephod , which were part of the priests' garments
If among us there were not a group of matured ones with such subjective experiences, we could not have much real fellowship with God
The tent, the fellowship, and the service are all constituted of the experiences of Christ by the Lord's children
All the materials offered by the people for the building of the tabernacle typify something of Christ experienced by us
To have wisdom is to have the ability to know and understand spiritual matters and to know how to carry out matters
We know how to help the saints to make a clearance of their past offer themselves to the Lord and follow the consciousness of the inner life
We know the style, the expression, and the shape of what we are building because we have the kinds of workmanship
In the building of the church there is the need for us to teach others to do the same thing as we are able to do
In the service and in the building of the church there is sometimes the need to devise something artistic and skillful
To work in silver we must know how to work with the redemption of Christ, with the cross, with the death of Christ
Sometimes we need to know how to work with silver and with bronze, and sometimes we need to know how to engrave, how to cut, or how to carve
Blue represents heavenliness, purple represents the kingship, the authority, and scarlet represents redemption
The first layer of the coverings was ten curtains of fine twined linen in two sections of five curtains each, coupled together
In the Ark of the Testimony, which was under the coverings, there were two tablets, and five commandments were written on each of them
Five is composed of four, representing man as the leading one of the creation, and one, representing God the Creator
Twenty-eight may also be composed of four, representing the creature, times seven, representing perfection and completion
These forty cubits covered the thirty cubit length of the tabernacle, leaving a ten cubit overhang at the rear, the west side
The basic numbers of the curtains are three, four, five, and seven, because these are the basic numbers of God's building
While the first layer represents Christ as our righteousness before God, the second layer represents Christ becoming sin for us
You cannot derive seven because the length of the curtains of goats' hair is thirty cubits instead of twenty-eight
If we lose the heavenliness and the divine nature of Christ we will automatically be separated for there will be no joining power between us
The more we are in the heavenliness and the more we are in the divine nature of Christ, the more we are strengthened to be joined together
When viewed from the outside by the worldly people, the church seems worthless and coarse, like porpoise skins
Although in principle the tabernacle is a type of Christ , Christ is more fully typified by the Ark of the Testimony
The Ark is composed of acacia wood, signifying the human nature of Christ, overlaid with gold, signifying the divine nature of Christ
Because the boards are constructed of the same two elements as the Ark, they are the enlargement, the expansion, of the Ark
The church, in principle, is the same as Christ-the human nature is mingled with the divine nature to become one entity
It is an entity of two different natures mingled together and joined into one, as typified by the acacia wood overlaid with gold
Since the basic numbers of God's building are three and five, we may realize that one and a half is simply half of the number three
It will not be easy for us to have such a change or to fall because we are always confirmed by others and can give testimony to others
The Lord said that some would bear fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and one hundredfold , indicating fruit-bearing in fullness
Man as a created being takes up the responsibility to have a testimony by being regenerated, by having God added to him
They were double below, and at its top they were completely joined to a single ring; thus he did to both of them for the two corners'
After the incarnation, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is now the Spirit of Christ
The Spirit of this Christ is the Spirit with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature mingled together
John 7:38-39 says, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
Verse 33 goes on to say, 'And he made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end'
Two bars formed the first line, one bar from end to end was the second line, and two bars formed the last line
Verse 34 says, 'And he overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold'
If the gold were to be removed from the forty-eight standing boards, they would all be separated from each other
Each board was overlaid with gold, on the gold there were the golden rings, and within the golden rings there were the golden bars
Without the gold, the boards would have been separated from each other, but in the gold they were joined together
The screen, or the outer veil, on the other hand, was at the door of the tabernacle separating the outer court from the Holy Place
In chapter 1 of Revelation there are the seven churches , and in chapter 21 there is the number twelve, the number of the New Jerusalem
Those who enter the tabernacle are according to the number seven, but in the New Jerusalem they will be according to the number twelve
The first entrance into the tabernacle is characterized by the number four, and the second entrance, by the number three
When he comes into the tabernacle, he meets the three inner entrances, signifying the Triune God, so that he may enter into the Triune God
We have seen that the church is built on the basis of the redemption of Christ, as typified by the one hundred silver sockets
Exodus 38:27 tells us that the sockets were very large and heavy, each being of one talent, the equivalent of almost one hundred pounds
Within the church, the building of God, what must be manifested is not the works, the doings of God, but the very nature and life of God
What we manifest, express, and show to others should be nothing other than the glorious divine nature of Christ
What is manifested in the church is the divine nature, but the manifestation of the divine nature depends upon the human nature
According to the history of the church, the building of the church has depended very much upon the transformed human nature
Brothers such as Martin Luther, George Muller, and John Darby had a transformed human nature, and their character was strong
The manifestation in the church is the divine nature with the divine life, but the support is the human character, the human nature
As we have seen before if a board had only one tenon it would turn easily and even fall just as we may easily fall if we stand on one foot
Spiritually speaking, they may face in one direction today, but tomorrow they may face in the opposite direction
The width of the boards of the tabernacle was one and a half cubits , indicating a half measurement of three cubits
Sometimes when the brothers and sisters come into the meeting, a wife and her husband may sit together as one whole
We must be joined with others by the Holy Spirit and in the Holy Spirit with the holding power of the divine nature
According to 36:31 and 32, there were five bars on the south side, five bars on the north side, and five bars on the west side
As we have seen, four bars were smaller and one bar, the middle one, was bigger, extending from one end of a wall to the other end
There is an aspect of life pictured by linen, and there is the aspect of life pictured by the rams and the goats
The Christ depicted by the coverings of the tabernacle is not a simple Christ, but a manifold Christ, a Christ of many aspects
Galatians 2:9 says, 'And perceiving the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars
On the one hand, to be cut and fitted is to be reduced, but on the other hand, it is to be increased in strength
They can be for protection and support, and they can also be the entrance for others to come into God's dwelling place
In John 109 the Lord said I am the door if anyone enters through Me he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture
The table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are the contents of the Holy Place
The three items of the first group reveal to us three aspects of Christ for our experience and for the Father's pleasure
In 37:10-29 the table of the bread of the Presence is mentioned first, followed by the lampstand, and then the altar
Our work is versus Christ as life, our knowledge is versus Christ as light, and our morality is versus the sweet savor of Christ
If we are going to enjoy Christ as life, as light, and as the sweet savor, we have to deny our own work, knowledge, and morality
If we walk and work according to our knowledge, we will never be able to enjoy and experience Christ as our light
If we take our own morality for our acceptance to God, we will not be able to experience Christ as our sweet savor toward God
Exodus 3710 says And he made the table of acacia wood two cubits was its length and a cubit its width and one and a half cubits its height
Exodus 37:24 says that the lampstand and its vessels were made of one talent of gold, which is close to one hundred pounds
Verse 25 says And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood a cubit was its length and a cubit its width square and two cubits its height
The height of the incense altar being a cube doubled indicates that the incense altar is a testimony before God
The altar of incense is a testimony before God, while the table of the bread of the Presence is a testimony toward us
The table was two cubits long and one cubit wide , constituting two units of one square cubit each, placed next to each other horizontally
What Christ is as a testimony to us horizontally comes up to the standard of what Christ is as the testimony to God vertically
Exodus 37:3-5 tells us that there were four rings in the Ark through which poles were placed so that it could be carried by four men
It may have been that only two persons were required to carry the altar, since both its length and width were one cubit
Samuel 6 and 1 Chronicles 13 record how David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, not borne by men but upon a mule cart
Although there is no measurement for the lampstand, there are many occurrences of the number three in the description of the lampstand
At the base of three pairs of branches were three calyxes, and on each branch there were three almond blossoms
With the lampstand there are the number three and the number six, and with the shaft of the lampstand there is the number four
Because He is a creature, He is light to man, who is signified by the number six, since man was created on the sixth day
Within the outer part, the Holy Place, there are three items-the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar-as its contents
The Ten Commandments mainly show us that God is a God of holiness, a God of righteousness, a God of love, and a God of light
The length was two and a half cubits, the breadth was one and a half cubits, and the height was one and a half cubits
Three signifies the Triune God, and five signifies the creature plus the Creator to bear the responsibility for God's building
The fact that two and a half cubits is half of five, and one and a half cubits is half of three indicates that the Ark is a testimony
He is the unique One, the wonderful One, with the real form of real humanity, but as the manifestation of God and with the content of God
All the commandments were covered by the expiation cover, and this cover became the seat where God could meet man and man could meet God
By this cover we could meet God and God could meet us, with all the problems between man and God having been resolved
If one would come into the Holy of Holies, he would immediately see the two cherubim, representing the glory of God
Without the law, the Ark could not have been the testimony of God, because without the law, there is no definition, or explanation, of God
Christ is the testimony of God because with Him there is the definition, the explanation, and the expression of God
The materials typify the aspects of Christ experienced by us and the surplus of that experience which we bring to God as an offering
The church could be built up only with the different aspects of Christ experienced by us and brought as a surplus to God
If we do not experience Christ in an adequate way and to a full extent, there will not be sufficient material for the building of the church
With each of these items, the sum of the weight contains a surplus, a remainder, representing something experienced by us and offered to God
The less experience the people of God have, the less material there will be for the building of the Lord's house
In the Scriptures, bronze signifies in type the tests, the trials, the judgment, and even the temptations which Christ suffered
His whole life was a life full of tests, trials, and temptations, and at the end, He was judged by God on the cross
After the silver is the gold, that is, after the experience of the redemption of Christ is the experience of the divine nature of God
The bronze, the silver, and the gold become the material for the building of the house of God through our experience
Many times God will put us into tests, trials, and sufferings in order that we may experience something of Christ
The world, the evil one, the kingdom of darkness, and the old man with the natural life have also been dealt with on the cross
If there had been fewer men numbered, there would not have been enough silver for the material for the tabernacle
If there is not a sufficient number of believers among us, there will be a shortage of the material for the building of the church
We have to preach the gospel to increase the number, bearing the spiritual children and bringing them into the church, the household of God
Exodus 38:29-31 says, 'And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels
We have to experience Christ as the bronze, the silver, and the gold, that we may have something to offer as material for the building
To stand against and suffer every kind of attack, the foundation of the outer court needed the bronze as its material
The redemption of Christ comes from the sufferings of Christ and the experience of the divine nature is based upon the redemption of Christ
The garments upon the priests signify the fellowship of the Body of Christ brought in through the priestly ministry
The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the reality of the building up of the Body, and is an issue of the building up of the Body
In this fellowship of the Body there is the ministry to God and to His people and the revelation of God concerning His people
The fellowship of the Body of Christ, the fellowship among the Lord's children and between God and His children, is something built up
The color blue represents heavenliness, purple signifies kingship, royalty, and scarlet signifies the redeeming work of the cross
The divine nature of God should be experienced by us to be the material for the building up of the fellowship of the Body
Precious stones are not natural materials created by God; they are created materials transformed into another kind of material
After being transformed, we become the precious stones, and we have the appearance, the likeness, the image, of God
The precious stones were set in golden settings, indicating that transformation is something set in the divine nature of God
Exodus 39:24-26 says, 'And they made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet strands, twined
The riches and the beauty of life go together with the testimony, the voices, the sounds, of the divine nature
The garments, as we have seen, signify the fellowship of the Body of Christ with the ministry to God and to His people
The pure gold signifies that the holiness of the fellowship of the Lord's children is something composed of the divine nature of God
The gold of the priestly garments signifies that the fellowship among the Lord's children is something of the divine nature
The flow of the water of life in the middle of the golden street of the New Jerusalem signifies the fellowship of the holy city
Exodus 39:32-43, as a conclusion to chapters 35 through 39, is a record of all the things made by the people of Israel for the tabernacle
In these verses and in chapter 40, two different terms are used for God's building: the tabernacle and the Tent of Meeting
The tabernacle points to the place where God dwells, but the tent points to the place where God's people meet together
The coverings of rams skins and porpoise skins are mentioned in verse 34 but the first two layers of the covering are not mentioned by name
The construction of this sentence shows that the curtains of fine linen are the tabernacle; they made the tabernacle with ten curtains
Verse 14 continues, 'And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he made in all'
Verse 19 says, 'And he made a covering for the tent, of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above it'
The reason why the first two layers of coverings are not mentioned in 393334 is because these two coverings are the tabernacle and the tent
From within, it is the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, and from without, it is the tent, the meeting place of God's people
From within, it is the dwelling place of God, and from without, it is the meeting place of the Lord's children
