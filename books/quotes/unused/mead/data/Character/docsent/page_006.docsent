   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Broad Having a Wide Perspective</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person who practices being genuine, exact, strict, and diligent can very easily become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By nature all sloppy people are broad.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, those who serve the Lord need to be broad in their character.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heart of Solomon was as broad as the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the sand surrounds the sea, it must be broader than the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must practice being broad.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only people who are broad can discover the great things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A narrow person can only study the trivial matters and give messages on minor topics; furthermore, he may even make a message on a major topic become insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A worker must learn to be broad, to study the Bible with a broad perspective, and to study the great items in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He must learn to pay attention to the significant things and to be magnanimous toward people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a person commands a wide view, and his leading of others and his knowledge of the Lord are likewise broad.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fine Not Careless or Negligent</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we should not be narrow, we should be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the last two thousand years, those who were greatly used by the Lord were both broad and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who were narrow and coarse were invariably of little use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord leads us according to the grace that God gives us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Too often, however, His leading is dependent on our character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some brothers and sisters can study the Bible and pray, but they cannot bear responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of their character, we dare not entrust the Lord s business to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They receive much grace and know how to pray, but they have not built up the proper character that enables them to accomplish things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although they may be placed in some areas of service, they cannot be entrusted with the service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The service of the Lord requires a broad and fine person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To study the Bible well, one must find the scriptural basis of any matter with a broad and fine eye.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Stable Steady, Not Easily Moved or Changed,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>and Not Panicky</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be stable is to be steady, immovable, and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a stable life the Lord lived on the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was not stirred by His brothers suggestion that He go up to Jerusalem to gain recognition, and when His opposers tried to stone Him, He walked past them straightly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Had we been in that situation, we either would have been stoned or would have quickly fled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the Lord knew that Lazarus was sick, He remained in the same place for two days more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our Lord never wavered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was stable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who know God s will do not panic.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An unstable person is like a reed in the wilderness blown by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Never steady or stable, he leans west when blown by the east wind and east when blown by the west wind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person who fluctuates can never understand the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He can neither work with others nor serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, to be stable is not to be slow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Stability includes not speaking uncertainly or doing things about which one is unsure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A stable person is not easily changed by his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He controls his time well and takes action only after he has waited and is sure of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be stable is not to be stubborn, stiff-necked, or obstinate, but to have an inner quality that is immovable and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Luther was a stable and strong person; therefore, God could use him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Stability is an important qualification in serving the Lord and in selecting a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Time works, but only with a stable person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a stable person realizes God s will, he will act immediately, regardless of the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet until God s time has come, no one is able to influence him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we need to learn to be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Panicking does not help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must remain steady through the storm, knowing that when it is over, the difficulties also will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those riding in a boat well understand the importance of stability.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When riding in a small boat on a stormy sea, one simply cannot afford to panic.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Deep Searching Downward and</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Digging Deeper, Not Being Superficial</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The book of Proverbs says that a foolish person is a shallow person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The observation of a shallow person is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His understanding of the church, people, matters, and things is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Being deep is closely related to being thorough and serious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A shallow person always makes superficial observations, whereas a deep person always searches and digs when he looks at things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To a shallow person, it may seem that there is nothing to do, even if a church is committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>While others have much to speak in a message, he has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While others labor to obtain light in studying the Bible, he is satisfied with merely a literal understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In listening to people, a deep person does not easily believe others and listens beyond superficial remarks.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, a shallow person readily believes others words, and his relaying of information is often inconsistent and incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As a result, gossip is created.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who serve the Lord must be deep in truth, in experience, and in leading others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A shallow person cannot serve the Lord, because he will make God s work shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who like to represent others are shallow people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One who is deep is neither complicated nor shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such a person is three-dimensional, always investigating and researching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Patient Being Able to Wait</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>and Not Being Anxious</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>According to James chapter five, the farmer who wishes to obtain the fruit of the earth cannot be anxious v. 7 ; he must wait for the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A patient person can wait.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Contrary to the common understanding, patience is different from endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To be patient is not to be slothful and sloppy but to work diligently without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything we do takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The amount of effort put forth will determine how much one can accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No work can be done cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who hope for instant accomplishments can never do the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To do God s work a person must work daily yet without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A patient person is not distracted by anything temporary, since he knows his commission.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is like the farmer, to whom waiting is normal: on one hand, he works in the fields; on the other hand, he waits.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In leading others one may often be disappointed, but those who are patient never give up hope.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When our work suffers a setback, we must be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Time will prove and time will tell.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Time will vindicate and manifest the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The manifestation of the glory of God may be only half a minute away.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One should be aggressive but not anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This requires practice.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A character produced out of patience is invaluable.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not draw conclusions quickly concerning people or matters.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>After only a few more days of waiting, the real situation will emerge.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must learn to be patient when we are in need.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are patient when in need, we will never have to borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, though he felt heavy and pressed, he was nonetheless patient.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Those who serve the Lord must possess such a quality.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Many people make a clamor over minor hardships, make known their smallest problem, and make an instant judgment concerning any matter which comes their way.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Such are useless people.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To be patient is to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is different from being slow.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whether one has a quick or a slow disposition, one must learn to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>To be slow is to fail to grasp opportunities; this must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>A patient person is prompt and nimble.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We should be patient before opportunity arises and should grasp it immediately when it does.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As we serve the church daily, we should wait patiently concerning all the situations which confront us and concerning the results of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Before the harvest season arrives, we should not be anxious; neither should we relax and be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should be full of feelings toward people and things.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should be sensitive and concerned and should have proper foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We must finish whatever work we have to do and leave the rest to time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In many ways time represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Those who would be proper persons, and especially be weighty in the hand of the Lord, must possess all of the preceding nine characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Without these nine qualities, we will not be enlightened in our study of the Bible; neither will we meet the requirements of the spiritual life in our dealings with people, things, and the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Also, it is very unlikely that we will have much spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Our being must correspond with the work we wish to accomplish, and our character must match the business we plan to do.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In a character that is fit for the Lord s use, acquired habits are much more important than inborn nature.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This all depends on the building up of a character that is suitable to the Lord.</S>
