<h2 class="head1">VI. THE SIXTH CYCLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Israel Again Doing That Which Was Evil<br />
in the Sight of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. They served the Baalim, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines, forsaking Jehovah and not serving Him (10:6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Anger of Jehovah Burning against Israel</h2>
<p>The anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and Jehovah sold them into the hand of the Philistines and of the Amorites, who oppressed them eighteen years. The children of Israel were greatly distressed (vv. 7-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Israel Crying Out to Jehovah</h2>
<p>The children of Israel cried out to Jehovah, saying, &ldquo;We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken our God and have served the Baalim&rdquo; (v. 10). Then they prayed for deliverance and returned to Jehovah (vv. 15-16a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah&rsquo;s Rebuking of Israel</h2>
<p>In verses 11 through 14 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s rebuking of Israel. First, He asked them if He had not saved them from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines. He also reminded them that He saved them when they were oppressed by the Sidonians, Amalek, and Maon. Then He went on to say, &ldquo;But you forsook Me and served other gods; therefore I will not save you again. Go and cry out to the gods that you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress&rdquo; (vv. 13-14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Jehovah Being Unable to Bear Israel&rsquo;s Misery</h2>
<p>In verse 16b we are told that Jehovah was no longer able to bear Israel&rsquo;s misery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Pressure of the Ammonites<br />
and the Need of a Head over Israel<br />
to Take the Lead to Fight against the Ammonites</h2>
<p>Verses 17 and 18 speak of the pressure of the Ammonites and the need of a head over Israel to take the lead to fight against the Ammonites. The princes of Gilead said each to his companion, &ldquo;Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead&rdquo; (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Rising Up of Jephthah</h2>
<p>Judges 11:1-11 records the rising up of Jephthah, a mighty man of Gilead, the son of a harlot. He was rejected by his stepbrothers but was received by the worthless men (vv. 2-3). Eventually, he was requested by the elders of Gilead to be their head and chief to fight the Ammonites for them (vv. 4-11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Jephthah&rsquo;s Negotiation<br />
with the King of the Ammonites</h2>
<p>Jephthah negotiated with the king of the Ammonites. His negotiation was based upon the fact that during a history of three hundred years, there had been no reason for the Ammonites to fight against Israel (vv. 12-27). However, the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah (v. 28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit Coming upon Jephthah,<br />
and Jehovah Delivering the Ammonites<br />
into His Hand</h2>
<p>The Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and Jehovah delivered the Ammonites into His hand (vv. 29-32).</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Jephthah Defeating the Ammonites</h2>
<p>Jephthah defeated the Ammonites and took their twenty cities. Thus the Ammonites were subdued before the children of Israel (v. 33).</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. Jephthah Making a Vow to Jehovah</h2>
<p>In verses 30 and 31 Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah. According to verses 34 through 40, Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter kept this vow with her whole life&rsquo;s virginity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. The Ephraimites Quarreling with Jephthah,<br />
and Jephthah Fighting against Them</h2>
<p>In 12:1-6 we see that the Ephraimites quarreled with Jephthah and that he fought against them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. Jephthah Judging Israel Six Years</h2>
<p>Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then he died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. After him, Ibzan, who had thirty sons and thirty daughters, judged Israel seven years (vv. 7-9). Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem, and then Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel ten years. He was followed by Abdon the Pirathonite, who had forty sons and thirty grandsons, judging Israel eight years. In total, these judges judged Israel thirty-one years (vv. 10-15).</p>
