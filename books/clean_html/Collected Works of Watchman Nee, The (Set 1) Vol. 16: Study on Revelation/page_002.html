<H1 CLASS=TITLE>PREFACE</H1><P>Prior to 1928 Brother Watchman Nee conducted a study with a few saints on the book of Revelation. The longhand notes of a brother who attended those meetings are published in this book. They have been briefly edited for the sake of clarity. The portion covering Revelation 2:19â€”3:22 is missing in the original manuscript.</P><P>In spite of the fact that a small portion is missing, this book forms a rather complete study of the book of Revelation by the author and is a valuable supply and contribution to the church in this, the end time.</P>
