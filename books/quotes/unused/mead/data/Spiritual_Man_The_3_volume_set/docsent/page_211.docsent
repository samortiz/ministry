   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUIET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God" 1 Pet 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though this word is spoken to the sisters, spiritually speaking, the brothers also need such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"To aspire to be quiet" 1 Thes 4:11 is the responsibility of every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today there is indeed too much talking among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes, there are more unspoken words than those that are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Confused thoughts and garrulous speakings are sufficient to cause our spirit to wander outside the control of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An "uncontrolled spirit" will often cause man to act according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the spirit of a believer is uncontrolled, it is very difficult for him to keep himself from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An erring spirit often leads to wrong conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before the mouth will be quiet, the spirit must be quiet, because whatever is in the spirit will come out from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should always be careful to keep our spirit quiet so that we can remain quiet when things become confusing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A quiet spirit is indispensable in order for us to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, we will fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our spirit is quiet, we can hear the voice of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we can execute God's will and understand what we cannot understand amid confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This quiet spirit is the ornament of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is what a believer should express outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NEW</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"In newness of spirit" Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a very important step in spiritual life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A stale spirit cannot touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the most, it can give people some kind of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even so, it is powerless; it cannot make people think earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A stale spirit only generates stale thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A vivacious life can never flow out of a stale spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever the stale spirit generates words, teachings, attitudes, thoughts, living is stale and old and belongs to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many doctrines only reach the believer's mind, they have no root in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Behind the teaching there is no spirit to "touch" another's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Maybe a believer has a doctrine which he once experienced, but now the doctrine has become something of the past, a souvenir, a memory in the mind it has passed from the spirit to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His thought may be quite fresh, newly received in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But since the thought has not been substantiated by life, those who hear him and those who are near him will not feel that there is a fresh spirit touching them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times we have seen a kind of Christian who always obtains something new from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we stand in front of such a person, we almost feel as if he has just come from the Lord's presence and has brought us before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of person seems to continually obtain new strength, just like eagles do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way young people are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not give people dry, rotten, and infested manna in the mind but fish and bread on the fire of coals in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is newness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from this, everything is stale.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how deep and how marvelous some thoughts may seem, they can never touch people the way the new and fresh spirit can.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must keep our spirit new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our spirit has not been in the Lord and blessed by the Lord, it is unfit to meet others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter whether it is our life, thought, or experience, if something becomes a memory in the past, it is stale.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All we have must continually be new from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Imitating others, without the experience in life, definitely does not count, but even imitating one's own past experience also has no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This should make us realize the importance of "I live because of the Father" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only when we constantly draw the Father's life to be our life can our spirit be new and fresh all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A spirit that is not new and fresh cannot bear fruit in labor, cannot walk according to the Spirit in life, and cannot overcome in battle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A stale spirit cannot see man because it has not yet seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the spirit to remain fresh all the time, it must always be touching God.</S>
