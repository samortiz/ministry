Suppose we are engaged in a business. At the beginning, we did not have the peace. Consequently, we did not proceed with it. But after two weeks, we felt peaceful again. What then should we do?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Walking Only according<br>to the Inner Sense of Peace</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: First John 3:19-21 tells us that a Christian should not find his heart blaming him. In your business engagement, you were held back at the beginning because you did not have the peace. Two weeks later you had the peace again. Your question is whether or not you should proceed. The answer lies in whether or not your heart blames you. If by going to hell you can have the peace, it is all right for you to go there. Romans 3:17 says, "And the way of peace they have not known." Isaiah 57:21 says that there is no peace to the wicked. The Lord says that peace He leaves with us (John 14:27). The Lord charged his disciples to bless others with peace (Luke 10:5). After He healed someone, He charged that one to go in peace (Mark 5:34). For Christians, peace is something within. If you are seeking for outward peace, you will never be able to be a proper Christian. It is also a very dangerous thing to do. As Christians, we have to be those who have peace within us. If the Spirit of God is not at ease within us, we will not have peace. Others' criticisms, attacks, praises, or debasements can all be ignored. What we need to pay attention to is our inner feeling. The apostle Paul said, "Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men" (Acts 24:16). This is a person who fears God and who lives in His presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not in the Letter, but in the Spirit</H2><P>The only place to be a Christian is in your spirit and your conscience. There is no other place and no other way to be a Christian. Only by being in spirit and in the conscience can a person be a genuine Christian. To practice being a Christian according to the conscience is like shooting in archery; the first time a person may miss. The second time, the third time, and even the tenth time he may miss also. But eventually, he will hit the mark. If you have a lawyer sit down and write out all the laws, you may find yourself blameless according to the laws. But this does not mean that you are a proper Christian. It is possible that you have done the right things, but that you as a person are wrong. If you compare yourself with the Bible, you may find yourself one hundred percent right according to it, yet in fact you as a person may still be off. Do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that I do not agree with the Bible. The Bible says that we have to love others as we love ourselves. If you merely act according to the letter of this word, even if you were to achieve it, you would still be off. If you touch God this morning, you will feel that you have to care for others. You will not only give your coat to others; you will be willing to give even your skin to others. Outwardly speaking, this kind of caring for others appears to be the same as the kind of love mentioned earlier. But in reality, there is a great difference between being a Christian according to the letter and one according to the spirit. Similarly, the humility spoken of in the Bible is not one which bows ninety degrees to others. This will only make your body pliable; what you need is a pliable inner sense. Your inner being needs to be soft. If it is slightly hardened, you will feel uneasy. Those Christians who behave in an outward way feel uneasy only when they lose their face. To be sorry because of an outward mistake is worthless. This is like a thief feeling sorry because he is caught, rather than because he has committed the crime of stealing. If a person feels sorry only because he is caught by others, this kind of sorrow is worthless.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
