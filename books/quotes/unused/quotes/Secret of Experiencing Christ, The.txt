The first seven chapters of this book consist of messages given during a conference in Tokyo, Japan, in October of 1984
The last four chapters consist of messages given during a conference in Anaheim, California, in November of 1981
Although none of them has ever seen Him with his eyes, all of His believers love Him and many would even die for Him
In John 6:46 and 16:27 the Lord Jesus said that He was 'from God,' and in John 17:8 He prayed to the Father, 'I came forth from You, and
In John 16:32 the Lord Jesus told His disciples that when the persecution came, they all would leave Him alone
The Lords word in 1526 does not mean that He will send the Spirit and the Father but it means that He will send the Spirit with the Father
When the Spirit is given, He is given with the Father, and the Father also gives the Spirit in the name of the Son
One verse, 15:26, says that the Son sent the Spirit, and the other, 14:26, that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name
When the Spirit is given, when the Spirit enters into us, we have not only the Spirit, but the Spirit with the Father in the Son's name
They realize that the Lord Jesus is in them, but because they may not be so zealous for the Lord, they feel that they do not have the Spirit
To them the Lord in whom they have believed and whom they have received is only the Savior, but not the Spirit
According to their thinking, the Spirit is outside of them, and they still need to receive the Spirit apart from Christ
The Bible does not convey the thought that the Son is on the earth, the Father is in the heavens, and the Spirit is like a dove in the air
Especially in the Gospel of John we are told clearly that the Father is always with the Son, and the Spirit is always with the Father
In the next moment we may sense that the Father is within us, and then after another moment, that the Spirit is within us
In Revelation 22:13 the Lord continued to declare that He is the First and the Last, and that He is the beginning and the end
He is every sentence composed with all the words, and, moreover, He is the entire composition composed with all the sentences
We shall realize that the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is one God who is embodied in the Person of Christ
The word Holy refers to the Spirit, indicating the complete God, and the word human refers to mankind, since a virgin is part of mankind
In John 3:14 Jesus said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
He was to be lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent to condemn Satan, the old serpent, with his nature of sin
Although John 1:29 says that Jesus is the Lamb of God, John 3:14 says that Christ was typified by the brass serpent
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
Hallelujah, in Christ as the last Adam we have been terminated, and in Christ as the second Man we are in the new beginning!
Through death, Christ destroyed Satan , and Satan, as the ruler of this world, was judged by Christ on the cross
Colossians 1:20 says that not only man, but also all things in the heavens and on the earth have been reconciled through Christ
He told us in John 12:24 that He, as the grain of wheat, had to fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains
Although they would say that they love the Lord, if you were to ask them why they love Him they would have little to answer
Many of us enjoy the Lord Jesus without an adequate knowledge concerning Him as the complete God and the perfect man
After receiving the revelation concerning the Person of Christ, we need to receive a revelation concerning His work
The work of Christ is composed of four major items: His ministry on earth, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension
We might consider that the four Gospels are nearly the same with only slight differences in presentation but this is absolutely not the case
Viewing the gospel from one side, we see in Matthew the gospel of the kingdom which brings sinners into a heavenly kingdom
In Matthew Christ brought in the kingdom of the heavens, and in Mark He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom
We sow the seed of the carnation into a field, and the seed grows, bringing forth the blossom of the carnation
Before we were saved we were all captives, carried away from God by many sinful things and even by things that may be considered good
Although Zaccheus was rejected by everyone, this Jesus nevertheless called him by name and told him that He was coming to visit his family
The Lord's morality was produced by the divine attributes in the human virtues, and it was a morality of the highest standard
When we see this, we will enjoy Christ and experience Him as the One who lives God and who does the will of God
If you put together all the aspects of Christ's work in the four Gospels you will see the ministry He carried out on this earth
In man's eyes, to die is not a work; but concerning Christ, His dying was a great work, a great accomplishment
In Genesis 3, God promised that Christ would bruise the head of the serpent , and when Christ died on the cross, He destroyed the Devil
In the Bible sin in the singular denotes our inward sinful nature , whereas sins in the plural number denotes our outward sinful deeds
He was killed on the cross as the Lamb of God to be the greatest offering, the sin offering for sin and the trespass offering for sins
As the Lamb of God He was killed as the sin offering and as the trespass offering to remove the totality of sin and of sins from the world
Christ as the Lamb of God first took away the load of sin; but to deal with the fallen man himself Christ had to do a further work
When Christ became flesh, He came only in the likeness of the flesh of sin , just as the brass serpent was only in the form of the serpent
The third accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He destroyed Satan, the old serpent, by being judged by God as the brass serpent
When Christ was crucified on the cross, God saw Him first as the Lamb, second, as the flesh which was sin, and, third, as a brass serpent
As the Lamb He took away sin as the flesh He caused sin to be condemned by God and as the brass serpent He destroyed the old serpent Satan
The fourth accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He dealt with the old man by being crucified as the last Adam
His crucifixion was a termination of the old creation, and He redeemed all the creation by tasting death for everything
Christ was qualified for this accomplishment because He was one of the creatures, the Firstborn of God's creation
Christ was crucified as the Peacemaker to make peace among all peoples by abolishing all the ordinances, the differences, among them
No two nations are able to be one, especially the Jewish nation and the Gentile nations, because of many differences, many ordinances
In the church, although there are people of many different races, all are brothers, all are members, all are components of this one new man!
We pointed out that there are eight main points concerning His work on the earth, two points in each of the four Gospels
Many Christians today do not have an accurate and adequate view concerning Christ's resurrection and ascension
Believers today often speak about Christ's death, but they do not speak as much about His resurrection and ascension
Not only is Christ doing many things in the heavens today, but He also accomplished many things before He ascended
We need to be impressed with all the crucial and wonderful things Christ has done in His resurrection and ascension
Such a resurrection was a great and strong proof that God accepted, sealed, and vindicated all that Christ had done
When the Jews put Christ to death, they thought that He was altogether defeated, and that His death was a sign of His failure
If Christ had never been raised from the dead, how could we know that God has forgiven us, that He was satisfied by Christ's death?
From these two verses we can see that on the day of resurrection, Jesus was begotten by God to be the firstborn Son of God
A circle has no beginning and no ending, and it is difficult to tell whether one point on a circle comes before or after another point
The Son of God is eternal, yet this eternal Son of God was born as the Son of Man about two thousand years ago
In His first birth Christ was born as the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born as the firstborn Son of God
In the first way He was God's only begotten Son, and in the second way He is the firstborn Son among many sons
Romans 8:29 says that the believers are to be conformed, not to the image of the only begotten Son, but to the image of God's firstborn Son
At this point we need to ask ourselves what the difference is between the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son
Our first response may be to say that the only begotten Son had no brothers, but the firstborn Son has many brothers
Today Christ is the Son of God in two respects: He is God's only begotten Son and He is also God's firstborn Son
To have us as His brothers He must possess humanity but as Gods only begotten Son in eternity past He possessed only divinity not humanity
Now we are the many sons of God being conformed to the image, not of God's only begotten Son, but of His firstborn Son
We all need to see that being born as the firstborn Son of God was a great work which Christ accomplished through His resurrection
Through His resurrection He was born to be God's firstborn Son, and at the same time all His believers were born to be the many sons of God
On the day of Christ's resurrection, all God's chosen people were resurrected and were born to be God's many sons
It was then in Christ's ascension as a man that God made Him the Lord, not only in His divinity but also in His humanity
Christ's ascension made Him the Head over all things to the church to bring everything in the universe back into good order
In His ascension Christ is the High Priest to care for all the believers and to care for the lampstands the churches
In the Old Testament type the priest cared for the lampstand by dressing it that the lampstand might shine brightly
Today in His ascension, Christ as our High Priest cares for His believers and cares for the churches as the lampstands
Today the One who governs the entire world the Administrator of the entire universe is not any king any president or any world organization
He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords, and He administrates the entire universe for the purpose of fulfilling God's eternal plan
Our experience confirms the fact that Christ is ruling over the world situation in order to fulfill God's purpose
If we had never come from China to America, the Lord's recovery would have been concealed in the Chinese language
In one of the first four books of the New Testament, the Gospel of John, we see an illustration of the vine with all the branches
In the following twenty-three books, from Acts through Revelation, what is revealed is mainly this organic union
The most wonderful reality in the Christian experience is that all the believers in Christ are united with Him in the way of life
The members of the body are united together not by organization, but by a living, crucial, and vital factor life
In His work, He did everything that is needed for the fulfilling of God's purpose, and He did everything that is needed for our benefit
Whatever He is and whatever He has done is altogether for one thing: that He could be united to us organically
Many Christians preach Christ and teach Christ in an objective way, making Him an objective Redeemer and an objective Savior
They may be right to a certain extent in an objective way, but surely they are wrong in relation to the subjective reality
Today in the Lord's recovery, the Lord is recovering this neglected matter of the believers' organic union with Christ
It is wonderful not only in revealing Christ's Person and work, but it is even more wonderful in its revelation of this organic union
In John 15 we see the vine with all the branches, but we do not see that all the branches have been grafted into the vine
In making a medicine we may collect a number of elements from various plants, flowers, roots, and trees, and combine them together
We may then process these elements further and extract the crucial essence of each element to formulate the most effective medicine
Through their believing in Christ and their being baptized into Christ, the believers have been brought into an organic union with Christ
Many of us may realize that the Lord Jesus has made us His home, but not many realize that, as the Lord's home, we are also His office
Christ is making His home in the believers' hearts through the Spirit's strengthening them into their spirit, that is, into their inner man
We fail to realize that this strengthening has a direction, that is, that Christ would make His own home in our entire being
Eventually Christ as the Head of the Body and the believers as the members of the Body are joined together to be the great universal new man
The matter of abiding in Christ is a central teaching in the New Testament, especially in the writings of John and Paul
On the one hand the tree must support the branches, and on the other hand the branches must remain in the tree
John 2:21 says, 'I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth'
At John's time, there were some who taught that Jesus was an earthly man, the son of Joseph and Mary, and that Christ was another person
If you say that Jesus is not the Christ, then you deny both the Father and the Son because the Triune God is one
Verse 23 says, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
The teachings of Confucius are good, but in China those teachings have distracted many learned people from Christ
In that large city the church had two meeting halls, one on the west side of the city and the other on the north side
These three things the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this life all distract us from Christ
From the day of her engagement a wife may begin to be anxious about whether her husband will be faithful to her or not
From the first day their little child is born, they may be anxious whether this child will breathe well, sleep well, and eat well
The parents are anxious for their children from the time of their birth to the time they themselves have children
They are anxious to see whether their children will read well, study well, get the best grades, and graduate from the best university
Neither should we be people of character-improving, doing good, or trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
If you abide in a certain place for a few days and then leave, that is not a home to you, but a hotel or a motel
As such a wonderful Person who has accomplished all the excellent things for us, He became a life-giving Spirit
All the elements of His wonderful Person and His excellent work are condensed and compounded into this life-giving Spirit
When we believed in Him and called on His name, He came into our spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
When you look at one side, it may be blank, but when you turn to the other side, you may see a composition written there
According to the objective teaching concerning the experience of Christ, we worship God as though we are far away from Him
We believe that the Lord Jesus is our Savior who died for our sins, and that God forgives us because of Jesus Christ
When Jesus returns, He will raise us up from the dead and take us to be with Him where we will enjoy eternal blessing with Him for eternity
Today's objective teaching is too superficial; it has made many Christians like robots or machines in their spiritual life
A few years later, after having had the experience of breathing Christ, he expressed his appreciation of this hymn
In Colossians 3:4 we are told that Christ is our life, and in John 6:57, that if we eat Him, we shall live because of Him
When we read the law, the Ten Commandments in the Bible, and realize that it is good, we may determine to keep it
The more you pray that the Lord will help you to honor your parents, the more you may lose your temper with your parents
There will be no need for the husbands to determine to love their wives; they will love their wives spontaneously
You live Christ, and you express Christ in your daily life; thus, what people see in you is Christ expressed by you
By living Christ we are saved, not only from losing our temper, but from every kind of shortcoming and weakness
If we experience such a daily salvation, we will shine as luminaries, as lights, in the world, holding forth the word of life
To be empowered to do all things means to be strengthened to show forth all of the human virtues created by God for His expression
Mankind became untrue, dishonorable, unrighteous, impure, unlovely, ill-spoken of, without virtue, and without anything worthy of praise
Paul said that he could do all things to be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, well-spoken of, full of virtues, and worthy of praise
When reading Philippians 4:13, the wives should say, 'I can do all things, including submitting myself to my husband'
The sisters can be the proper wives submitting to their husbands, and the brothers can be the proper husbands loving their wives
Four books in the New Testament Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians may be considered the heart of the divine revelation
In recent years the Lord has shown us vision after vision and given us revelation upon revelation from these books
In order to see the secret of experiencing Christ, we need to consider the negative things Paul deals with in these books
The four constituents of the religious world plus the 'I' and the flesh are the negative things found in the book of Galatians
Having accomplished redemption to fulfill God's economy, Christ has become the all-inclusive Spirit, the blessing promised by God to Abraham
How much do you experience in a practical way the Christ who has been revealed in you and who is now living in you?
When we face so many hard situations in our daily living, we realize that the secret of experiencing Christ is very precious
A clue to the secret of experiencing Christ in Galatians is found in the phrases 'in faith' and 'through faith'
Paul did not live by his own faith; he lived by the faith that is both in the Son of God and is of the Son of God
In verse 2 he inquires of the Galatian believers, 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
In the past we have pointed out that in the New Testament faith has two aspects the objective aspect and the subjective aspect
In order to understand the meaning of faith in these verses, we need to have spiritual experiences that are very fine
In the first two chapters of Galatians Paul speaks of Christ, but in chapter three he begins to speak of the Spirit
With this realization we experience Christ living in us and being formed in us, and we also have the experience of being clothed with Christ
If we neglect the Word and pay no attention to all the verses we have heard, it will not be possible for us to live Christ
In 5:5 Paul puts the Spirit and faith together: 'For we by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness'
In doing other things we may neglect the Spirit and be satisfied as long as the things we do are good or right
In the very last verse of Galatians Paul says 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers'
The Spirit will become in us the living faith, the realization of Christ, and we shall be one with Christ in a practical way
Just as we cannot afford to neglect the things needed to maintain our physical life, so we cannot afford to neglect the Word of God
May we take this word seriously and practice it in a very fine way so that day by day and even moment by moment we may experience Christ
After we were saved, as those in Christ, as members of the church, we began to be bothered by other kinds of negative things
Preachers like to quote Paul's word in Ephesians 2:5 and 8, telling us that we are saved by grace through faith
All the different nationalities have their particular ordinances their own rituals ways and practices with respect to worship and daily life
Even though the ordinances have been nailed to the cross, they may still be very prevailing among both believers and unbelievers
If you take the time to visit believers in other countries, you will no doubt be exposed as still having certain ordinances
We were not created with the capacity to fathom the Triune God, but we were created with the ability to receive Him
Not only do unbelievers walk in the vanity of the mind, but even millions of today's Christians also walk in the vanity of the mind
Now we must consider the secret of overcoming these negative things and of experiencing Christ and the church according to Ephesians
Is this not a continuation of the matter of receiving the Spirit by the hearing of faith mentioned in Galatians?
As we hear the Word and receive it, something is infused into us, and this infused element becomes living faith
The more we contact the Word in this way, the more Christ will spread into our inner being and make His home in our hearts
In 6:17 and 18 we see the way to take in the Word: receive the Word of God by means of all prayer and petition
The Word washes us inwardly and, by spreading into the inward parts of our being, makes a home for Christ within us
If we read and prayread the Bible in a proper way even musing upon the Word singing it and dwelling in it our inner being will be filled
We also have the living water flowing within us to wash away the old elements, the wrinkles and the spots, and to renew us
When we are filled with the Word and washed by it, our entire being is renewed and transparent, and we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem
As a result, we become Christ's home, and we love all the saints in the church life, both the young and the old
In Galatians 38 Paul says And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham
From our experience we can testify that if we had not heard the gospel or read the Bible, we could not have faith
Whenever the Word is taken in this way, spontaneously something rises up in a person which causes him to believe in God
When we handle the Word of God rightly, the Word will enter into us and become the Spirit functioning in us to give us faith
In our experience we shall have the hearing of the Word, the believing in Christ, and the receiving of the Spirit
Although we have the assurance that we are eternally saved, we still need to be saved day by day and even moment by moment
It is by the Word with the Spirit producing faith that we receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation and are enlightened
When our mind is saturated with the Word, the Spirit spreads into our mind, and we are renewed in the spirit of the mind
By the Word coming into our being and filling it, we are also washed; we are cleansed by the washing of water in the Word
When we come to the Word and take it into us by prayreading singing or musing we eventually sense that we are armed equipped and empowered
Should you be delayed in heavy traffic on the way home from work, you can open this pocket version and pray-read a verse
When a brother and his wife are exhausted and not enjoying the Word, neither is likely to be happy in the Lord
According to Paul's word in 1:17, those who announce Christ out of rivalry thought 'to raise up affliction in my bonds'
Of thinking so much about our own virtues, qualities, abilities, and attainments, we should regard the things of others
Probably you have not realized that personal affairs are a negative thing keeping you from the experience of Christ
You may actually care more for your domestic affairs than for Christ, more for your education or employment than for the church life
If we go on caring for our own things instead of caring for the things of Christ, there will be no way to have the church life
In 3:2 Paul issues a serious charge: 'Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision'
If it does not encourage us to experience Christ and to live the church life, we should pay no attention to it
Those who are careless may have no anxiety, but every sensitive and cautious person suffers a great deal of anxiety
Paul's word in 2:16 indicates that the bountiful supply of the Spirit was applied to him because he was receiving the word of life
When there is the preaching of the Word, it will be possible for those who hear this preaching to receive the Spirit
When the word of life entered into him, it became the bountiful supply of the Spirit which enabled him to magnify Christ and live Him
Unless we receive the word of life into our being, we shall not be able to hold forth this word, to magnify it, to manifest it
Paul concludes the Epistle to the Philippians by saying, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit'
It is important to realize that whatever we enjoy by receiving the Word eventually becomes the grace in our spirit
In 2:23 he refers to asceticism when he speaks of 'self-imposed worship and humility and severe treatment of the body'
Wherever the gospel is preached, those who proclaim the gospel will confront elementary teachings, certain traditions, and philosophies
Both modern, scientific countries and undeveloped countries have their own elementary teachings, elements of the world
Philosophy, tradition, asceticism, and the various elements of the world are the negative things found in the book of Colossians
If we had written the Gospel of John, instead of 'In the beginning was the Word,' we might have said, 'In the beginning was God'
Whenever we read of faith in the New Testament, we should realize that both the Word and the Spirit are implied
In Colossians 2:5 Paul speaks of 'the firmness of your faith in Christ,' and in verse 7, of 'being established in the faith'
The four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians all speak of the Word, the Spirit, and faith
In Ephesians the Word is called the word of God ; in Philippians, the word of life; and in Colossians, the word of Christ
If we would have the Spirit and the faith to experience Christ and enjoy Him, we must come to the Word again and again
When many Christians read the Bible, they just read with their eyes and try to understand with their mentality
Ephesians 6:17 and 18 say that we should receive the Word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit
He could say that he was with them in spirit, rejoicing and seeing their order and the firmness of their faith in Christ
The secret of experiencing Christ has much to do with the Word, the Spirit, faith, the human spirit, and prayer
In our daily life we also need to care for the younger ones, sharing with them our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him
In the book of Philippians Paul indicates that this sharing of material supply is for the furtherance of the gospel
