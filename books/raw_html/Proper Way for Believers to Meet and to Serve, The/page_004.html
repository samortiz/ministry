        <h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
BEING LIFE IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Both men and women buy things when they go shopping. There is a sister who, before being saved, would look for sales in the newspaper every Saturday and then go shopping. If she saw a nice yet inexpensive piece of fabric, she would buy it. The only thing that prohibited her from buying things was insufficient funds in her bank account. After she was saved, she still liked to read the sale advertisements on Saturdays and buy discounted items. However, she began to feel uneasy within while reading the advertisements and had to stop. Although she had an inner feeling not to go shopping, she somehow found herself on her way to the department store. At the store she would select a dress, but a voice within her would say, &ldquo;Put it down; do not buy it.&rdquo; She would argue with the voice, saying, &ldquo;This item is very nice. I must not miss this opportunity.&rdquo; But the inner voice would keep saying, &ldquo;Put it down; go home!&rdquo; Eventually, she would have to put the dress down and go home. Many sisters have had similar experiences. God dwells in us and causes all sorts of trouble. This tremendous matter proves that we are saved, that our spirit has been enlivened, and that the living God is living in us. This is an experience of God being life to His believers.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:13-14 says, &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&rdquo; This is how God&rsquo;s salvation differs from religion and philosophy. Neither exhortation nor endurance can cause a believer to refrain from murmuring and reasoning. It is possible for a believer to refrain from murmuring and reasoning because God is operating in him.</p>
<p>As long as we have a family, schoolmates, colleagues, or companions, it is not possible to escape arguments. A newlywed couple may not argue during the first two days of their honeymoon, but some couples quarrel within the first few hours after they are married. The longer they remain as a couple, the more competent they are at arguing. When they become parents, they have even more arguments with their children. Who can say that he has never murmured? Husbands murmur to their wives, wives murmur to their husbands, children murmur to their parents, and siblings murmur among themselves. It is impossible for a person to escape arguing and murmuring. A person who can restrain himself from lying is holy, a person who can restrain himself from arguing is holier, and a person who can restrain himself from murmuring is an angel. But such a person does not exist on earth. Everyone lies, argues, and murmurs. Moreover, people like not only to argue but also to reason. They do their best to argue and reason in order to justify themselves.</p>
<p>Although we are saved, the old man, who likes to reason, is still with us. Therefore, the more we argue, the more we think that we are right. However, the moment we begin to argue, a voice within us tells us to stop arguing and to confess and pray. This is God being our life and disapproving of our arguing. Many believers have had such experiences. These experiences are different from religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Philosophy with its ethics is for self-improvement. A person who practices self-improvement might become better, but he is still a human being. A believer, however, can say, &ldquo;I am better, not because of myself but because the living God lives in me. I know that He lives in me because He prevents me from shopping, He prevents me from quarrelling with my spouse, and He prevents me from venting my anger. He is operating in me. The true and living God lives within me, and He is becoming one with me.&rdquo; This is a fact. We should respond and say, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah! God is living, and He is living in my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not think that since I can give this message, I do not get angry. However, when I want to voice my resentment, a voice within me says, &ldquo;Why are you angry? James 1:20 says that &lsquo;the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God&rsquo;&rdquo; I occasionally reason with God, saying, &ldquo;Even so, this person has made me angry. Lord, let me be angry just this time.&rdquo; But He says, &ldquo;Calm down and pray,&rdquo; and I have no choice but to kneel down and pray. Sometimes I am at a loss and can only say, &ldquo;Lord, I am really angry.&rdquo; This is a prayer. Do not think that such a prayer is poor. This kind of prayer can often lead me to be enlightened and repent to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me and forgive me. I need the cleansing of Your precious blood.&rdquo; After such a confession, the fellowship within is restored, and I am able to enjoy the Lord again.</p>
<p>Believers are very different from unbelievers because the living God has been added into the believers. When an unbeliever gets angry, his anger can last a week. Sometimes when an unbelieving couple quarrels, the husband and wife will not speak to one another for an entire week. However, when genuine believers get angry, they can calm themselves down quickly. This is what the Bible means when it says, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation&rdquo; (Eph. 4:26). Once the sun sets, our anger should be dispelled. It is not easy to do this, but it is easy if we have the Lord. If we harbor some resentment, our anger will dissipate when we pray. Some Christians are short of grace, so it can take them six hours to calm down. Other Christians have more grace, so their anger dissipates quickly, and they can apologize to their spouse. Apologizing to our spouse is not as easy as apologizing to others. The brothers in particular need grace to humble themselves in order to apologize to their wife. This is an experience of God being our life.</p>
<p>As genuine Christians, we can do what ordinary people cannot do, we endure what ordinary people cannot endure, we can suffer hardships that ordinary people cannot suffer, and we can bear accusations that ordinary people cannot bear. This is because God is in us. When we read the four Gospels, we appreciate the living of the Lord Jesus. This same Jesus is living in us today. He is the Triune God living in us as our life. For this reason, He said, &ldquo;Learn from Me&rdquo; (Matt. 11:29). I would be foolish to tell a monkey, &ldquo;You should imitate me and learn of me.&rdquo; How can a monkey learn of a human? Monkeys have one life, and humans have another life. The Lord Jesus is not only our life; He also lives in us so that He may live out of us. This is the difference between believers and people in religion or philosophy. We do not try to cultivate or improve ourselves. Rather, we have the living God who created the universe and who died for us on the cross. He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit so that we may live out His life. This is the distinctive feature of the believers.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that this distinctive feature has been neglected in Christianity. Preachers mainly tell people, &ldquo;You are sinful and have made mistakes, so you need Jesus. The heavenly Father loves you and has sent Jesus to be your Savior. If you believe in Him, you will be saved.&rdquo; After they lead people to believe in the Lord, they say, &ldquo;Because you have believed in the Lord, you should improve yourself and conduct yourself in a proper way; otherwise, you will not glorify God.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is not right, but we repeatedly have this same mistaken concept. We pray, &ldquo;Lord, I was wrong yesterday. I lost my temper, and I lied. I ask You to give me grace. Help me not to lose my temper with my wife and not to lie again. Lord, I want to be a new husband.&rdquo; Praying in this way is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>We must realize that making resolutions following repentance is futile. Our failures themselves prove that we are unable to fulfill our resolutions. Only the One who is in us is able. Therefore, instead of making resolutions, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I made a grave mistake, and I can make the same mistake again. Only by Your life supplying and bearing me can I be delivered from making such a mistake. I am like a garment. Lord, put me on, and let me put You on as well and live You out.&rdquo; This is what the Bible means when it says that we are in the Lord and that the Lord is in us (John 15:4-5). When we are in the Lord, we have put on the Lord, and when the Lord is in us, He has put us on. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit. When we were baptized into Him, we put Him on (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27), and when He entered into our spirit, He put us on. Now He is our life to be expressed through us; that is, He lives Himself out of us. This is what Paul says in Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo;</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
