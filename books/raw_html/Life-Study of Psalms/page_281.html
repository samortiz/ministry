<P>The Bible is not mainly for godliness or comfort. Rather, the Bible teaches us that Christ is the centrality of God's eternal economy to produce the church, first as God's house and then as God's kingdom, issuing in the millennial kingdom with full restoration for all the creation, which will consummate in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. Have you ever thought that the Psalms is a book not mainly on godliness and comfort but on Christ with the house of God and the city of God leading to the restoration of the universe during the millennium and ushering us into the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem? In our reading of the Psalms, our preoccupation with godliness and comfort should be replaced with Christ.</P><P>The Psalms were composed not only by David but by a number of different writers, including Moses and some of the sons of Korah. Eventually, the one hundred fifty psalms were arranged in their present order. I believe that this arrangement was made after the time of Malachi, approximately 400 B.C. The sequence of this arrangement is very meaningful. For example, it surely is significant that immediately after Psalm 1, which is on the Law, we have Psalm 2, which is on Christ, the Son of God and His anointed One.</P><P>It is not a simple matter to see how the psalms may be put into groups. In the foregoing message we considered the group consisting of Psalms 102 through 106. We have seen that Psalm 102 unveils Christ as the key that turns the earth to the Lord and that Psalms 103 through 106 are a narration of God's history in His forgiving our sins, in His greatness in the creation of the universe and its fullness, in His dealing with Abraham and his descendants according to His covenant, and in His dealing with Israel in the wilderness and in the promised land. In this message we will consider another group of psalms&#151;Psalms 107 through 110. In Psalm 107 there is a change of tone, and in Psalm 110 there is the highest revelation of Christ. Here the revelation of Christ reaches the peak. I believe that it was Martin Luther who said that Psalm 110 is the highest among all the psalms.</P><P>In the preceding psalms Christ is revealed in many different aspects. In a forthcoming message we will see that in Psalm 118 we have a further revelation of Christ, an unveiling of Christ as the cornerstone (v. 22) for the building of God. As the cornerstone, Christ joins the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers and the other, the Gentile believers. Christ is therefore the One who joins the Jews and the Gentiles for the building of God's house. Christ is the cornerstone for God's building, and God's building is the church today as God's house and God's kingdom, and ultimately God's building is a new city, the New Jerusalem.</P><P>As we will see, Christ is unveiled also in Psalm 119. We may think that this psalm is on the law, but it is actually on the testimony of God and the word of God. According to the Bible as a whole, the testimony of God is Christ, and the word of God is also Christ. Christ's being the testimony of God depends on His first being the cornerstone. If He were not the cornerstone, He could not be the adequate, qualified testimony, or witness, of God. If we consider Psalms 118 and 119 together, we will see that Christ is both the cornerstone and the testimony of God.</P><P>As we come to Psalms 107 through 110, we need to realize that the last psalm in this group, Psalm 110, is on Christ in the highest way. However, in order to have the highest revelation of Christ in Psalm 110, we need the three psalms that come immediately before it. Let us now go on to consider Psalms 107 through 110 one by one.</P>
