The One who comes from the heavens is above all. Even though He was on earth, under the heavens, yet He was above all. Because Christ is all-inclusive, unlimited, and universal, He is above all. While He was on earth, He was still in the heavens (v. 13).<h2 class=head2>Loved by the Father</h2><p>John 3:35 says, &#8220;The Father loves the Son, and has given all into His hand.&#8221; The words &#8220;the Father loves the Son&#8221; are very important. This verse implies that apart from Christ or besides Christ, nothing pleases God. Nothing that is outside of Christ is pleasing to God the Father. The Father loves only one person, and that person is Christ.<p>When some hear that Christ is the unique One loved by the Father, they may point out that John 3:16 tells us that God so loved the world. However, God&#8217;s love of the world is related to Christ. Apart from Christ, God does not love anyone or anything. Although God loves the world, if we did not have Christ, we would miss God&#8217;s love.<p>We need to put verses 16 and 35 together, and then we shall see where we can enjoy the Father&#8217;s love. Only in Christ can we enjoy the love of God the Father. We need to be in Christ by believing in Him. If we are outside of Christ, we have nothing to do with God&#8217;s love. Yes, God so loves the world, but we shall miss that love if we are not in Christ. We can meet the love of the Father only in Christ.<h2 class=head2>Given All Things by the Father</h2><p>John 3:35 says not only that the Father loves the Son, but also that the Father has given all things into the Son&#8217;s hand. The Father has given all things, including us, to Christ. The entire universe has been given to the Christ whom God the Father loves. He is the unique recipient of the Father&#8217;s love and gifts. This implies that if we are not in Christ, we shall not receive any gifts from the Father. Christ is the unique object of the Father&#8217;s love and also the unique recipient of the gifts given by the Father. If we would enjoy God&#8217;s love, we need to be in Christ. Likewise, if we would participate in what God gives, we also need to be in Christ. Paul says that all things are ours and that we are Christ&#8217;s (1 Cor. 3:21-23). If we are not for Christ, nothing can be for us.<h2 class=head2>Sent by God</h2><p>This One who is from above, who is above all, who is loved by the Father, and who has been given all things by the Father, has also been sent by God. Verse 34 says, &#8220;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; Christ is God&#8217;s Ambassador. He was sent by God and from God.<p>The Lord Jesus was sent not only from God, but also from with God. John 6:46 says, &#8220;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.&#8221; The Greek preposition translated &#8220;from&#8221; in this verse, para, means by the side of. The meaning here is &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Lord is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God. Furthermore, when the Lord came as the One sent from with the Father, the Father came with Him.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
