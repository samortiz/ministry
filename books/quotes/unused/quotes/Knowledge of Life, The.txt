Even fewer have touched this matter of knowing and experiencing this life which accomplishes the purpose of God
According to the teaching of the Bible, at least six points should be mentioned in order to make this subject clear
When explaining what life is, we must first be clear about one thing-the kind of life in the whole universe which can be counted as life
John 3:36 also says: 'He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life'
Only the life of God is life, and other lives are not counted as life, because only the life of God is divine and eternal
Being divine means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinctive from all others
Only God is God, only God has the nature of God, and only God is transcendent and distinctive; therefore, only God is divine
Gold not only characterizes the cup but is also its very essence, whereas its nature of being rust-resistant is due to its being gold
In the whole universe, only God's life is both divine and eternal; therefore, only God's life is considered life
That which is immortal is unchangeable; it remains the same and continues living even after passing through any kind of blow or destruction
All kinds of life in the universe, whether of angel, man, animal or plant, are mortal and changeable; hence, they are not eternal
It not only has the name of life, but also the reality of life, and thus it completely fulfills the meaning of life
According to the divine and eternal nature of the life of God, God's life is the unique life in the whole universe
Revelation 22:1-2 speaks of a river of water of life flowing out of the throne of God, and in the river of water of life is the tree of life
The Bible speaks of this on the one hand as His being 'manifested in the flesh' , and on the other hand as the 'life which was manifested'
The rock in the Old Testament typified Him; it was smitten, and from it came living water to be obtained by the people of Israel
He was crucified so that He could flow out from the husk of flesh into us-His many fruits- and become our life
When this flowing out flows to eternity, then eternity will be filled with the condition of life and become an eternity of life
God flowed out from heaven, and through the flesh He flowed into our midst as the life which was manifested to us
Today it is in this life that God becomes our all and is our all; it is in this life that God becomes our God and is our God
The teaching of the Bible mainly reveals to us that God is life; it speaks mostly of God as life; seldom does it mention 'the life of God'
It tells us God is our life and speaks of God as our life; it almost never says that God wants us to receive 'His life'
The life of God does not necessarily imply the whole of God Himself, whereas God is lifeor God as life denotes the complete God Himself
It is not sufficient merely to know that we have life; we must know further that this life we have is God Himself
It is not sufficient only to know that we should live out life; we must also know that the life we should live out is God Himself
If the love humility gentleness and patience which we live out are not the flowing out of God or the manifestation of God they are not life
That which is lived out from God is the expression of God, or the expression of life, because God is life and life is God
These two passages therefore show us that it is by God being in Him and Him being the Holy Spirit that He is life
John 7:38-39 further tells us that the living water which flows out from us is the Holy Spirit which we received
Life originally is the Father; in the Son, it is manifested among man; and as the Spirit, it enters into man for man to experience
Since the Spirit is the Spirit of life, man can receive life through the Spirit, and when man sets his mind on the Spirit, it is life
Repentance which results from God's enlightenment surely will cause man to touch God, and is therefore an experience of life
An experience which results from God passing through man and man passing through Him is considered an experience of life
It is not that we detect our own fault, but rather, when we draw near to God, we are inwardly met by God, and thereby we see our own fault
All experiences of life are from God and are His working within us; therefore, they can cause us to touch God and experience Him
All experience that is not such is not the experience of life, for life is God, and to experience life is to experience God
Though God is life, He cannot be our life except He be in Christ and become Christ, and thus be experienced by us
His divine life must be mingled with human nature so that it can be united with us, who possess the human nature, and be our life
We experience God revealing Christ in us through the Holy Spirit, thus enabling us to know and receive Him as our life and our all
Christ being formed in us is the maturity of the inward life; it is then that we have all that is His as our inner elements
Christ being magnified in our body is the expression of the outward living; by this we allow all that is His to be our outward manifestation
In this experience, we experience Christ not only as the elements of our inward life, but also as the manifestation of our outward living
The more we experience Him, the more we are changed, until even our body is changed in form to the likeness of His glorious body
All that pertains to the life within us and the sanctified living out from us should be our experience of Christ
To experience Christ means that all our living and actions are Christ Himself living out and acting out from us
When we experience life, not only do we experience God, not only do we experience Christ, but we also experience the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is both God and Christ as life being experienced by us, or God in Christ as life being experienced by us
As the experience of life is the experience of God and Christ, so also is it the experience of the Holy Spirit
God is life, Christ is God coming as life, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God in Christ as life, or the Spirit of life
It is this Spirit of life, the Holy Spirit, that causes us to experience all the content of God in Christ as life
It is this Holy Spirit of life who leads us to put to death the evil deeds of the body, and it is this Holy Spirit of life who prays in us
In order to experience this life, we must experience the Holy Spirit; and when we experience this life, we experience the Holy Spirit
The experience of life is the experience of the Triune God, or the experience of God in Christ and Christ as the Holy Spirit to be our life
The Holy Spirit working in us, leading us to experience Christ and to experience God in Christ-this is the experience of life
When, in the Holy Spirit, we pass through God and Christ and allow God and Christ to pass through us, this is the experience of life
You can say that it is zeal, religious living, or self-improvement, but you cannot say that it is the experience of life
Regeneration is the first step of our experience of God's life; therefore, it is our first experience of God's life
Yes; we would still need to be regenerated, because our human life is only a created life, not God's uncreated life
God's purpose for us human beings is that we may obtain His uncreated life and be transformed into His image to be like Him, as He is
In the beginning, although Adam's life was not corrupted, it was a created life, not an uncreated life; a human life, not God's life
Even if man had not fallen or his life had not been corrupted, even though he were good without any evil, he would still need regeneration
If God desired man to be only a good man, and man had not fallen and been corrupted, he would not need to be regenerated
God's desire is not that man should be only a good man, but, much more, a GOD-man, one who is the same as He is
Even if we created human beings had not fallen, we would still need to obtain God's life in addition to our original human life
The higher one is that it is God's intention that man be like Him; therefore, we must obtain God's life beside our own life
In brief, to be regenerated is to be born once again, to be born of God , or, apart from our original human life to obtain God's life
Originally we were born of our parents; but now we are born once more, this time of God; hence, this experience is called being born again
Being born of our parents caused us to obtain human life, whereas being born of God causes us to have God's life
We must clearly see that to be regenerated is to be born of God, or, in addition to our original human life, to possess God's life
Once he receives the Lord as his Savior, God's Spirit enters into his spirit and puts God's life in it, causing him to be regenerated
Such children of God, having God's life and nature, and able to be just like God, can fulfill God's purpose in creating man
Regeneration affords us a beginning in life, and that which is gained through regeneration affords us the growth in life
The results of regeneration issue from what is gained through regeneration, the former being accomplished because of the latter
All the accomplishments of regeneration upon us are achieved because of the things we have obtained through regeneration
We have already seen in the previous chapter that regeneration occurs when the Spirit of God puts the life of God into our spirit
All of its capabilities and functions issue out of its life, and all of its outward activities and expressions originate from its life
His life causes Him to have such divine capabilities and functions inwardly and such divine actions and expressions outwardly as well
Have you ever realized that because the life of God is in us we have all the capabilities and functions in us which are in God
The Bible shows us that God has two kinds of great power: one is the great power of creation; the other is the great power of resurrection
Through regeneration, God has wrought His life into us, which means He has wrought His great resurrection power into us
Oh, may we see that this life of God, which we receive when we are regenerated, is God's great power of resurrection!
Just as God is able to overcome death, so we also are able to overcome death because of this life of great power within us
Because the life of God entered into us, the law of life which is contained in this life was brought into us too
When a certain life gets into, a certain creature, it causes that creature to have its natural law or its law of life
When the life of God enters into us, it brings into us the natural law contained in it, and this law becomes the law of life within us
The laws of the Old Testament are the laws of God which God had written with characters on stone tablets outside of man
Because these laws which are written in us are the natural abilities and natural laws of the life of God, the Bible calls them the 'law'
The law of the Spirit of life, derived from the powerful life of God and the powerful Spirit of God, is also powerful
We may say that the life of God in us is the source of this law, and the Spirit of God in us is the executor of this law
After Ezekiel 36:26 says that God gives us a new heart, it says that He takes away our stony heart and gives us a heart of flesh
Originally our heart opposed God, did not desire God, and was as hard as stone toward God; thus, it became a 'stony heart'
When God regenerates us He renews our heart and makes our heart a new heart with a new inclination new affection new delight and new desire
Since regeneration gives us a new heart, it causes us to have a new inclination and love, a new desire and longing
On one hand, He uses the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse away the defilement of our spirit, so that our spirit becomes clean
On the other hand, He uses His Spirit to put His life into our spirit, so that our spirit may have His element
Since at the time of our regeneration God has already given us a new heart, why does He proceed further and put a new spirit in us?
If God only gives us a new heart, He can only cause us to desire Him and love Him; He cannot enable us to contact Him
The heart has only the function of loving God and thirsting for Him; it does not have the ability to contact God or touch God
The heart is only good for us to love God, but the spirit is good for us to contact God and to fellowship with God
My heart likes it very much; but my heart cannot contact it or take possession of it, for my heart does not have such ability
Our new heart enables us to have new delight and inclinations, new feelings and interest toward God and the things of God
Our new spirit enables us to have new contact and insight, new spiritual ability and function toward God and the things of God
Once our heart loves God, our spirit touches Him; once our heart delights in the things of God, our spirit understands them
In the Old Testament, God only caused His Spirit to come from without to work upon man; He did not cause His Spirit to dwell within man
Only after the Lord's death and resurrection did God give His Spirit to us and cause His Spirit to dwell in us as the indwelling Spirit
He is able to reveal both God and Christ to us from within, that we in Christ may receive and enjoy the fullness of God
In John 14:16-17 the Lord tells us that the Holy Spirit who comes to dwell in us as the Comforter is 'the Spirit of truth'
Although the life of God is in Christ , yet it is known and experienced by us through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us
Although Christ dwells in us to be our all, the central reason for His indwelling is that He might be our life
God in His salvation has regenerated us that we might receive His life, have His nature, and thereby be entirely like Him
Although through His Spirit He causes us to receive, know, and experience His life, yet He makes Christ our life
When we in His life grow into His image and become like Him we grow into the image of God and become like God because He is the image of God
We have already seen that the life of God is all that God is; therefore, when God puts His life in Christ, He puts all that He is in Christ
When regeneration causes us to have the Holy Spirit, it causes us not only to have Christ, but also to have God
We have also seen the first experience of life, which is regeneration, and the various things which are gained through regeneration
All those who have the experience of life know the deep relationship which exists between the sense of life and the experience of life
If we would investigate the subject of the knowledge of life, we must look into the matter of the sense of life
Since the peace mentioned here is a matter of feeling, the death and life mentioned here are also a matter of feeling
Death includes at least these five elements, and the sum total of these elements is largely equivalent to death
At the same time, death causes men to suffer pain; one who suffers the most pain is one who has fallen into death
The sense of death is due to our minding the flesh, while the sense of life and peace is due to our minding the spirit
The reason Romans 8:6 mentions the sense of life is that it has mentioned three things previously: the Spirit, life, and the law of life
Whenever we mind the spirit and act and live according to the spirit, this law gives us the feeling of life and peace
What Romans 8:6 speaks of is wholly a matter of consciousness, and this consciousness is given to us by the law of the Spirit of life
When a man sins and does wickedness, we cannot say that he has no feeling, but at least we can say that he has laid aside his feelings
If one does not lay aside the feelings, if one is restricted by the inner feelings, do you think he can still commit sin and do wickedness?
When anyone cheats, steals, beats others, robs others, or does any other bad and evil deeds, he must lay aside his feelings
We must live in the life which is in the Spirit, take care of the sense of life in the Spirit, and live according to this sense of life
Almost all the Epistles of the apostles have words of blessing and greeting in which grace and peace are mentioned
A person who experiences God, enjoys the life of God, and tastes the power of the life of God daily is bound to have peace within him
If we have gained enough of God within us and have experienced God and the life of God sufficiently, we will have enough peace within
It is produced from the things we have gained through regeneration-the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God
The life of God is the strongest life therefore when this life is in us it causes us not merely to have feelings but to have strong feelings
When it becomes sick there is strong feeling, and this strong feeling occurs when we disobey the law which is within the body
Similarly, when we obey the law of life, it does not give us much feeling, but when we disobey it, it gives very distinct feelings
The Holy Spirit as ointment is anointing and moving in us; Christ is living in us with activity; and God is working in us
Whether it be the life of God, the law of life, or the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God within us, they all cause us to have feelings
The feelings derived from all five are not five kinds of feelings, but one feeling, that is, the sense of life which we are speaking of
The reason that this feeling is the feeling of life is that it is derived from the Triune God of life, the life of God, and the law of life
The feelings which they cause us to have are derived from life and belong to life; hence, they are the sense of life
If we follow the sense of life, we follow the guidance God gives us, and at the same time, we receive a verification of where we are living
It gives us the feeling of life and peace, or, in other words, it makes us feel strong, satisfied, lively, bright, and comfortable
It is there continuously leading us, making known to us where we should live; and it continuously proves to us where we are now living
It is this sense which leads us on in life; it is also this sense which continuously proves and reveals to us our real condition in life
Life and peace are the positive feelings which the sense of life gives us within, thus proving that our condition in life is normal
Weakness and uneasiness are the negative feelings which the sense of life gives us within, thus proving that we have some problem in life
Every sense of death proves that we are more or less minding the flesh, and that we have touched to some extent the things outside of God
If we feel weak and uneasy within, it proves that we are fleshly minded and are touching things outside of God
It is not necessary that a Christian should never feel weak, but even when he feels weak, he should still feel strong
He feels weak because he has come to know himself; he feels strong because he touches Christ and knows Christ as his life
It may be that we are more or less in the flesh for weakness is a sense of death and the sense of death always comes from minding the flesh
He feels pain because he meets tribulation from without he has the sense of peace because he meets the Lord and touches the Lord from within
If we desire to go on in life, we must pay attention to the proving and leading which this sense of life gives us from within
There is a very heavy burden within me, a very deep feeling, that what every church today needs most is the things of life
In Matthew 7, the Lord says that some preach the Gospel and some cast out demons, yet they are not approved by Him
Our work should just be the releasing of the life of the Lord, the imparting and supplying of the Lord's life to others
That ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ'
The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God and it is through the Holy Spirit of God that the life of God enters into us and lives in us
The fellowship brought to us by the life of God, though derived from the life of God, comes by means of the Holy Spirit of God
The Holy Spirit of God moves, requires, and urges within us to cause us to have the fellowship which comes from the life of God
If we desire to have fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God, but also live in the Holy Spirit of God
The life of God is the source of the fellowship of life, and the Holy Spirit of God is the medium of the fellowship of life
The answer is that it is neither, because the same electricity which is in the power plant is also in these light bulbs
If it were local blood, it then would have no communication; and if it were the blood of the whole body, it would also have no communication
The more we allow the flowing of life to flow in us, the more we are inwardly supplied with the fullness of God
As soon as the fellowship of life is interrupted, the sense of life causes us to feel we have lost the supply of life
When the fellowship of life is not interrupted, the sense of life causes us to feel that we have the supply of life
Whether we are living in the fellowship of life and whether we have the supply of life depends entirely on what the sense of life indicates
The more we live in the fellowship of life, the keener is our sense of life, and the more we are supplied with life
We should remember that the sense of life always tests and proves us, while the fellowship of life always supplies us
Because every experience of life is in the spirit, knowing the spirit is a basic issue in the experience of life
It is difficult to find another place in the Bible which speaks of our condition in the spirit as clearly as this one
Life is the fruit of the spirit, and the spirit is the origin of life; therefore, by touching the spirit we touch life
In verse 6, before the apostle says that setting the mind on the spirit is life and peace, he says, 'To set the mind on the flesh is death'
Life causes us to know the things derived from the spirit, thus enabling us to know the spirit from the positive side
Just as life enables us to know the spirit from the positive side, so death enables us to understand the spirit from the negative side
If we thoroughly understand these four things, we can clearly know the spirit, which is very decidedly related to them
In spiritual matters, death not only causes us to lose the sense of life, it also causes us to have the sense of death
In the Old Testament time, the Spirit of God only fell upon men, so that men received the power of God from without
Today, in the New Testament time, the Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of power, but also the Spirit of life
The life of God is in Him, and He is thus the life of God; therefore, when He enters into us, the life of God enters into us
Later we blend into it some undiluted fruit juice with sugar added, so that it becomes a glass of water-sugar-juice, a three-in-one drink
The water signifies our spirit, the undiluted fruit juice represents the Spirit of God, and the sugar stands for the life of God
The spirit, in which rests the life of the Spirit of life which we are speaking of here, includes both the Spirit of God and our spirit
Bible translators have understood the Spirit mentioned in Romans 8 as the Holy Spirit; therefore, they have written Spirit with a capital S
Spiritual fact and spiritual experience tell us that the Spirit mentioned here is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit
Within this one spirit, which is the mingling of the two, there is the life which God bestows on us; thus, it becomes the spirit of life
Now, when the Spirit of God enters, He not only quickens our spirit, but also adds the life of God into our spirit
Now not only is our spirit alive, but it also has the life of God; and it is not only a spirit; it is the spirit of life
When we have such feelings, we know we are minding the spirit, walking according to the spirit, and living in the spirit
The spirit itself is relatively difficult for us to sense, but we can easily sense such feelings of life in the spirit
The life of God in our spirit can be said to be God Himself; therefore, the sense of this life surely will make us sense God Himself
That which agrees with its nature, its law approves and accepts; anything which is otherwise, its law opposes and refuses
If what we are and do agrees with its spiritual nature this law in our spirit approves and accepts it otherwise this law opposes and refuses
All that we are and do must be from the spirit and in the spirit; then the law of life in our spirit will approve and accept it
All that it approves and accepts or opposes and refuses is made known by what it feels and what it desires us to feel
The spirit of life in us is not only the place where the Spirit of God and the life of God dwell, it is also the place where the new man is
If in our outward action and behavior we mind the spirit of life within us, then we are living by the spiritual new man within us
We can say that this consciousness of being natural and peaceful is the result produced by the sense of the law of the spirit of life
If we mind the spirit of life within us, we naturally walk and live according to the law of the spirit of life within us
The more we walk according to the spirit and live in the spirit, the richer and deeper this kind of sense within us becomes
The apostle says that the result of minding the flesh is death, whereas the result of minding the spirit is life and peace
The consciousness of death makes us feel just the opposite of these-unnatural, unrestful, uncomfortable, and uneasy
The flesh the apostle speaks of here refers not only to the lusts of our flesh, but also to our entire old man
All that belongs to our inward new man belongs to the spirit; likewise, all that belongs to our outward old man belongs to the flesh
Such prayer by our head makes our spirit incapable of obtaining the supply of life; instead, it only touches the sense of death
If we were in the spirit, if we spoke by the spirit, we should feel satisfied and restful within, which means we would sense life and peace
Death not only causes us to have such depressed, empty, uneasy, and unhappy feelings, but also makes us lose the sense of life
We cannot quite apprehend directly what the spirit actually is, but by the sense of the spirit, it is not difficult for us to know it
If we walk and live by closely following the sense of the spirit, then we are following the spirit and minding the spirit
These senses are from the spirit; therefore, they can cause us to touch the spirit and thereby know the spirit
We have seen the sense of the spirit and knowing the spirit; now we shall see the difference between the spirit and the soul
The physical part refers to the body, and the metaphysical refers to the psyche, which is the soul spoken of in the Bible
These words speak clearly and thoroughly concerning the condition of the soul as to the things of the Spirit of God
The nature of the soul is not in accord with the things of the Spirit of God; therefore, it neither wants nor receives the things of God
We must be clear concerning the impotence of the soul in spiritual things and regard it as an important matter
Toward spiritual things they are often cold in heart; they are not only slow in understanding, they are also slothful in seeking
That which is included in the soul, analytically speaking, is the mind, the emotion, and the will-these three parts
Man after the fall, especially today's man, lives largely in the mind and is directed by the thoughts of the mind
Today, regardless of who or what we are considering, we must begin with man's thought in order to win man's mind
Nowadays there are so many theories schools and educational methods and they all have one aim dealing with mans thought to win mans mind
Man loves, detests, rejoices, mourns, and is excited or depressed-these are all functions of the emotion in man's soul
With such people, when you reason with them in thought, it is often difficult to get through; but you can very easily move their emotion
Man decides, determines, judges, chooses, receives, and refuses-these are all functions of the will in man's soul
Just as those who are in the mind or emotion live in their mind or emotion, so those who are in the will likewise live in their will
You may reason with him, but he does not care for reason; you may appeal to him with emotion, but he has no regard for emotion
Sometimes, no matter how you reason with them, you cannot convince them; yet if you only shed some tears, you can win them over
We only need to see whether or not he acts by the mind, emotion, or will, and whether or not he lives in the mind, emotion, or will
As long as he acts and behaves by any one of these three, or as long as he lives in any one of these three, he is a soulish man
Though before man he seems to be without sin and faultless, before God his spirit is blocked, and his spiritual understanding is dull
A man living in the mind lives in the soul and definitely becomes a soulish man with no ability to understand spiritual things
Just as the mind is the difficulty of the brothers in spiritual things, so the emotion is frequently the hindrance of the sisters
Emotion is their pitfall; it keeps them in the sphere of the soul, living by the soul and being a soulish person
One who is in the emotion will unconsciously care very much for the emotion in dealing with others and handling things
One with a strong will very easily leans on his will in dealing with man and matters, making firm resolutions and unalterable decisions
If we can recognize what kind of person is soulish, it is not difficult to realize what kind of person is spiritual
Since a soulish person lives by the mind, emotion, or will, a spiritual person must be one who does not live by these
Since a soulish person lives by the soul and not by the spirit, then a spiritual person must live in the spirit and not in the soul
They live by the spirit and in the spirit, and they allow the spirit to be the master and source of all their action and behavior
The spirit in them occupies the preeminent position; it is the source of their behavior and starting point of their action
Although they use their mind, emotion, or will, yet they always follow the sense of the spirit in making use of these organs of the soul
Although they use the organs of the soul, yet they are not soulish, and they do not live by the life of the soul
The fall of man caused man to fall from the spirit to the soul, so that man no longer lives by the spirit but by the soul
He wants us not only to live a faultless life, but even more to live a spiritual life, a spiritually faultless life
Although their spirit is already quickened, they do not know they should use their spirit and live by their spirit
Granted that their thoughts are clean, their emotions are balanced, and their decisions are accurate, they are still soulish, not spiritual
Although they know that man should contact God in the spirit, yet they still use the soul to touch the things of God
They know they have a spirit, yet they do not use their spirit; they know they should live by the spirit, yet they do not live in the spirit
No matter how excellent and strong any part of our soul may be, it still cannot apprehend the things of God or understand spiritual things
We must also see that our soul and all things that belong to it have already been crucified on the cross of Christ
In Galatians 2:20, when the apostle says, 'I have been crucified with Christ,' the 'I' he refers to is the soul
We must see how powerless the soul is before God, how it cannot comprehend the things of God and cannot please God
He should fear his emotion just as he fears sin and in fear and trembling live in the spirit not being directed or influenced by his emotion
One who is in the will should see his will as the enemy of God in the things of God, as the opponent of the spirit
Rather, we should let the spirit occupy the first place to govern, direct, and employ our mind, emotion, and will
The three lives spoken of here are the three lives that are within every saved one-man's life, Satan's life, and God's life
Ordinarily, men think there is only one life within man, that is, the human life which is obtained from the parents
The Bible says that when God created Adam He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; thus, Adam obtained the created life of man
God put man in the Garden of Eden before two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
That day in the Garden of Eden-that is, in the universe-a situation developed which involved three parties-man, God, and Satan
God desired man for the accomplishment of His will, while Satan wanted man for the fulfillment of his evil desire
God's intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be united with Him
On that day, Adam, deceived as he was by Satan, ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Besides our original created human life and the life of Satan obtained through the fall, we also obtain the life of God
When God formed man of the dust of the ground, He breathed into him the breath of life, and 'man became a living soul'
When man was enticed by Satan and fell, he ingested into his body the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan
When man receives the Lord Jesus as Savior and is saved, the Spirit of God, bringing with Him the life of God, enters into the human spirit
A person who is saved has the life of God in his spirit, the human life in his soul, and the life of Satan in his body
The sense of these two parts is the sense in the spirit; hence it is called the spiritual sense, or the sense of God
The soul, which is situated between the spirit and the body, is our inner, psychological part and includes the mind, emotion, and will
The sense of the mind is based on rationalization, whereas the sense of the emotion is based on likes and dislikes
The tripartite situation of man, God, and Satan which existed on that day in the Garden of Eden exists also in us today
The reason he can act in such a way is that within him there are the lives of all three-man, the devil, and God
Though we have all three lives within us, yet we obtain them at three different junctures due to three different occurrences
During the fall, due to our contact with Satan and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, we obtained the fallen life of Satan
At the time of our salvation, because we believed in the Son of God and received Him, we obtained the uncreated life of God
Since the three different lives of man, Satan, and God exist in us concurrently, according to which one should we live?
Earlier, in chapter six, the apostle says, 'For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law'
In order to explain the statement that we are 'not under law,' the apostle continues to speak about law in chapters seven and eight
Chapter seven begins by saying, 'Or are ye ignorant, brethren , that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth'?
the law of the mind' , which is in our mind, causes us to desire to do good; therefore, it may also be called the law of good in our mind
Since this Spirit contains life, belongs to life, and is life, the law of this Spirit is called 'the law of life'
The flesh spoken of here, according to the context of verses 21, 23, and 24, refers to our fallen and transmuted body
We are told clearly later in the chapter that within us fallen beings there is a will which desires to do good and a law of good in our mind
The law of good in our mind is of our original created life and existed before we were saved, even at our birth
Some may say that our good created life, having been corrupted by Satan through the fall, has lost its element of goodness
Since the life of Satan is evil, the law which is derived from his life naturally causes man to sin and do evil
The law of the Spirit of life is derived from the Spirit of life which is in our spirit and from the uncreated divine life of God
In this life of the Spirit of life, there is contained a law which is the law of the Spirit of life, or the law of life
We must see clearly that when we were saved, God did not put the law of good in us; rather He put the law of life in us
Since the life of doing good is in our soul, the law which is derived from this life is also, of course, in our soul
The function of this law is especially manifested in the mind of our soul; hence this law is called 'of the mind'
In our soul we have the life of man, the law of good which is derived from such a life, and the good human nature
During man's fall, he took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into his body; hence, the evil life of Satan entered into our human body
In our body we have Satan, the life of Satan, the law of sin which is derived from the life of Satan, and the evil nature of Satan
Due to the fact that Satan and his evil things entered into our body and mixed with it, it was transmuted and became the corrupted flesh
Since the Spirit of life together with the life of God dwells in our spirit, the law derived from the Spirit of life is also in our spirit
In our spirit we have God, the life of God, the law derived from the Spirit of God's life, and His nature of life
Especially when the law of God outside of us requires us to be good, this law of good in us gives us the inclination toward doing good
The law of sin in our members, derived from the evil and fallen life of Satan in our flesh, contains the evil nature of Satan
When the law of good in our mind gives us the desire to do good, this law of sin rises to war against it and brings us into captivity
We sin not of our own choice nor of our own volition; rather it is the law of sin which motivates us from within
One is derived from the created life of good and works in the mind of our soul, giving us the desire to do good
The other is derived from the fallen, evil life of Satan and works in the members of our body, causing us to commit sin
These two opposite laws, doing contradictory works in our mind and in our members, war against one another within us
For this reason, one who is strong in intellect is more capable of doing good, while one who is more passionate easily does evil
Galatians 5 speaks about our flesh striving against the Spirit; this occurs only after we are saved and have obtained the Holy Spirit
The will, which belongs to the human soul, being controlled by Sin and obeying the orders of Sin, instigates the human body to commit sin
With the body as the base, it projects forth the poison of sin, causing damage to our soul and spirit, until our whole being is corrupted
In the soul of man today, his mind is evil, his emotion defiled, his will rebellious, and even his spirit darkened
As far as the nature of being both divine and eternal is concerned of all the socalled lives in the universe only the life of God is life
Since the law of the Spirit of life is derived from the life of God, its nature is 'life,' just as the nature of the life of God is 'life'
It is not like the two previously mentioned laws which are either 'good' or 'evil' because of the life from which they are derived
The good derived from the life of man is but the good of man, without the nature of 'life' or the element of God
Only the good of God derived from the life of God is not only good, but also possesses the nature of 'life' and God's very element
The good of man, derived from the life of man and containing nothing of the life nature of God, naturally differs from the life of God
Since God's good is derived from the life of God and contains the life nature of God, we cannot say that it differs from the life of God
We know that laws vary in strength according to the degree of strength of the objects of their respective origins
The strength of man is limited while the power of the law is enduring mans striving is a selfexertion while the power of law is spontaneous
It is in our center, that is, in our spirit, that God adds into us a new element, which brings with it a mighty power of life
We are enabled to live out the good required by the law of God, which we were unable to live out formerly through the law of good
Much more, through the life which is derived from the law of the Spirit of life, we are able to live out the life which God desires
The law of God outside of us represents God in giving us the requirements of holiness, righteousness, and goodness
We are not only disabled from fulfilling God's law, but instead we violate the holy and good requirements of the law of God outside us
Not only will we be able to fulfill the holy and good requirements of God, but we can meet the divine standard of God Himself
The law of good in our soul, upon touching this requirement of God's law, desires to fulfill it and determines not to be covetous any more
The law of good in our soul is no match for the law of sin in our body; in almost every encounter it loses to the law of sin in our body
We would be enabled to fulfill the requirement of the outward law of God not to covet and live out the surpassing holiness of God
Just as our body surrounds our soul, so the law of sin in the body surrounds the law of good in our soul and is stronger than it
The law of sin in our members is like a villain who always follows the lady and attempts to create trouble between her and that man
The result of man's reformation is but the highest human excellence; it cannot cause man to live out the divine standard of God's nature
Now we shall especially see the law of life, which is also the law of the Spirit of life mentioned in the last chapter
The result of these five combined together is that we are caused to walk in the statutes of God and to keep and do His ordinances
The Holy Spirit within us gives us new strength to do the will of God and to please God so that God can be our God and we can be Gods people
When man was created by the hand of God, he had only a good and upright human life; he did not have the divine and eternal life of God
On the negative side by the Lord Jesus shedding His blood on the cross redemption was accomplished and the problem of mans sin was settled
The authority itself is the life of God; therefore, when we have this life, we have the authority to be the children of God
It works from the center to the circumference, or from the spirit to the soul and then to the body, accomplishing its outward expansion
If we refuse its working if we do not follow it closely and cooperate with it it has no way to show forth its power or manifest its function
Our original heart, because of rebellion against God, became hard or old; therefore, it is called a 'stony heart' or an 'old heart'
The spirit we originally had, because of separation from God, is dead and has become old; therefore, it is called an 'old spirit'
Since this old spirit has lost its ability to fellowship with God and contact God, it naturally has no way to cooperate with God
With a new heart we are willing to cooperate with God, and with a new spirit we are able to cooperate with God
The Spirit of God, the eternal Spirit or the infinite Spirit, has unlimited functions and transcendent strength
One thing is clearly revealed to us here: God's way of deliverance and man's self-improvement are fundamentally different
Man's self-improvement is but a work wrought upon that which man originally has, namely his soul and his body with their capabilities
To attempt improvement is but to improve the things we already have, and this is limited; but to add something of God Himself is unlimited
Though this law of life is derived from the life of God, yet it is through regeneration that it enters into us
As long as any particular life exists and is free, it can naturally develop its characteristics and manifest its abilities
Though the law was good, yet man being evil and dead did not have the power of life to meet the demands of that law
In the New Testament era, when God through the Holy Spirit regenerates us, He puts His own life, accompanied by the law of life, into us
It is not like the law of the Old Testament, which is a law of letters, and which can only demand but cannot supply
Suppose we set up some laws for it, demanding: 'You must grow out green leaves, bloom red flowers, and bear peaches'
Suppose now that we make demands on a dead man, saying: 'You should breathe; you should eat; you should sleep; you should move'
We know that the demands of such laws upon this dead man are of no effect at all; none of them can be fulfilled
If we could put resurrection life into him and bring him back to life, he will very naturally want to breathe, eat, sleep, and move
If we want this life to have completion of maturity, it also needs to gradually grow and mature in every part of our whole being
The growing and maturing of this life comes about by the working of the law of life in every part of our whole being
The mind, will, and emotion in the soul, being the seat of the personality of man, are also more for man and related to man's side
In Jeremiah this law of life is called 'law,' while in Hebrews it is called 'laws'-one is singular, and the other plural
Whether Jeremiah calls it the singular law or Hebrews calls it the plural laws, they both really refer to this one law
The heart is very closely related to the law of life, which works in our various inward parts and thereby becomes the various laws
We have already mentioned that the heart connects the spirit and the soul; thus, the heart is in between the spirit and the soul
After man is saved, if the life of God is to come out from within him, it must pass through the heart and have the cooperation of the heart
The heart is the entrance and exit of life: the coming in of life and the going out of life both depend on the heart
The heart can only cause us to love God and be inclined toward God; it cannot make us touch God and have fellowship with God
We must first contact all spiritual things by the spirit, then comprehend and understand them with the mind of the heart
It is also like beholding a certain color: it must first be contacted with the eyes and then distinguished with the mind
When our spirit is strong, however, we send God's salvation directly into men's spirit by the words of the Gospel
In order to contact God and spiritual things, we need to use the spirit, and we also need to have the heart so inclined
Whichever part of the heart has a problem life is obstructed and brought to a standstill there and the law of life cannot regulate any more
The life of God within us should be able to freely work and grow, causing us to receive daily revelation and frequent light
There are many brothers and sisters whose spiritual life does not grow and whose spiritual living is not normal
All these matters in the heart become a hindrance to the working of the life within us, making it impossible for the law of life to regulate
When God deals with our heart, He deals with these four aspects so that our heart may be soft, pure, loving, and at peace
To be soft means that the will of the heart toward God is submissive and yielding, not stiff-necked and rebellious
When God deals with our heart so that our heart is soft, He takes away the stony heart out of our flesh and gives us a heart of flesh
Not being submissive to the Lord and not even fearing the Lord, they gradually fall away from the Lord's presence
There are also brothers and sisters who are hard toward everything; yet when God and the will of God are mentioned, they become soft
A loving heart means a heart in which the emotion loves God, wants God, thirsts after God, yearns for God, and has affection toward God
In the Bible, there is a book which speaks specifically of the love of the saints toward the Lord-The Song of Songs in the Old Testament
Because this book speaks especially of our love toward the Lord, it also shows forth especially our growth in the life of the Lord
The Lord desired to lead the emotion of Peter to so love the Lord that he could be one who has a loving heart toward the Lord
If our heart has such love toward the Lord, the life of the Lord within us can move smoothly and do as it pleases
A heart at peace means a heart in which the conscience has no offense , no condemnation or reproach; it is safe and secure
If our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows all things ; He would even condemn us more
We must deal clearly with all the offenses, condemnation and reproach; so we 'shall assure our heart before him'
When our heart is thus at peace, God can pass through, and the law of the life of God can continue to work within us
Or is there outside of God a person, a matter, or a thing which we are deeply concerned for and which has occupied our heart?
If so, the life in our spirit will definitely have a way out, and the law of life can definitely be regulated out from within us
In whatever part our heart has been dealt with, there the life of God can work, and there the law of the life of God can also regulate
Since we have seen the seat of the law of life, we know that this law of life works in the various inward parts of our whole being
In another place we see that the Bible wants us to love God with all our heart, all our soul, all our mind, and all our strength
In this way the veil within us is taken away , and we can see light, receive revelation, and know God and the life of God
Our entire being, both within and without, will become like God and be filled with the riches of the life of God
As soon as we are regenerated and have the life of God, this law of life inside us definitely causes us to have a certain consciousness
Our responsibility is to obey the sense of the law of life, thus allowing this law of life to freely work within us
If only we are willing to obey the first sense, though it be comparatively weak, the consciousnesses following will be stronger and stronger
In this way the law of life can work within us unceasingly until it reaches the various inward parts of our whole being
Our answer is this: Before we obey the first sense, let us not be concerned about what we should do after that
When God called Abraham, He only told him the first step: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house'
It makes us dependent upon God, that is, dependent upon God to give us one consciousness after another consciousness
No matter what we want to do or what we are doing, as soon as we have such a sense of forbidding within us, we should stop
The working of God within us requires our cooperation through obedience therefore our obedience becomes a requirement for the working of God
On the one hand it takes away what we should not have in us, and on the other hand it adds in what we should have in us
What is taken away is the element of Adam in us, and what is added is the element of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
The element of death is that wonderful death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, that death which includes all and ends all
It is like the medicine we take, some of which contains two kinds of elements: the element to kill the germs and the element to nourish
It is also like the blood in our body, which contains two kinds of elements: the white blood corpuscles and the red blood corpuscles
White blood corpuscles have one function, to kill germs; the red blood corpuscles also have one function, to supply nourishment
As soon as we are saved and have the life of God, the law of the life of God in us causes us to have a certain consciousness
We have already mentioned that the law of the Old Testament is the law written outside of man, the dead law, the law of letters
It is also this power which seeks to regulate within us every day and is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think
When we spoke of the relationship between the law of life and the heart, we mentioned that the law of life can be hindered by the heart
It will still continue to work within us to such a degree that our heart which is not inclined toward God becomes inclined toward God
Proverbs 21:1 says: 'The king's heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: he turneth it whithersoever he will'
By His power, He regulates our emotion and regulates our will; thus, regulating to and fro He enables us to obey Him again
Such good is from God, and flows out from the life of God; therefore, to do such good works is to live out God Himself
His work was not dependent on his own soulish power, but on the dynamic power of the life of God which dwelt in him
In all past generations, those who were used by the Lord toiled continuously and suffered constantly in the work of the Lord
Whenever this life works and regulates within them, they will explode inside; they will carry out the work which has the dynamic power
The service of the New Testament is according to the Spirit; it is fresh, and therefore it is living and makes man alive
Old Testament service is an activity based on outward dead rules; therefore, it cannot give man the supply of life
Such a gift does not refer to the supernatural gifts, such as speaking in tongues, seeing visions, healing, casting out demons, etc
The result of such transformation always causes us to be like the Lord Jesus, or, in other words, like the glorious human nature of the Lord
Transformation is the process and to be like the Lord or to have the same image and nature as the Lord is the end result of transformation
It was not until God declared the ten commandments on Mount Sinai that God's intention in man was clearly revealed
Only when man has His life and becomes His son can man really know that He is God and really allow Him to be God
In the morning of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus told Mary Magdalene, 'I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and my God and your God'
They only worship an objective God, a God who is high above all; they have not allowed God to be their God within them
When this law of the life of God regulates within us, or when God works within us, God is being our God in this law, that is, in His working
He is not our God in belief; neither is He our God in rules; but He is our God in a living law of life, in a living function of life
At this time, He again becomes our God in a practical sense; He is no longer a name nor a doctrine, but a living God
We must put ourselves in the hand of God, letting the law of the life of God regulate us; then we can actually have God as our God
God must be our God in the law of His life and we must be His people in the law of His life because our relationship with God must be living
Whenever His law of life within us ceases to regulate, this living relationship of Him as our God and us as His people also ceases
We must allow the law of the life of God to regulate us only then can we have God as our God and we be His people in a manifestly living way
We can see clearly that God being God to man in the Old Testament and in the New Testament differ very greatly
In the Old Testament, God was God to the people of Israel high above all on His throne, and according to the regulations of law
In the New Testament, God enters into us to be our life, and it is in the law of this life that He is our God and we are His people
By seeing the main points of every aspect of the law of life, we know how important this law of life is to our experience of spiritual life
We must see clearly and understand thoroughly every main point concerning this subject; then we can have real experience in life
Without fear of repetition, we shall again summarize these main points so that we may have a deep impression of them
The working of this life comes from the natural function and characteristic of this life; in other words, it comes from the law of this life
The degree to which we know God from within determines how much we have of God and how much we experience Him as our life
When we are regenerated, His Spirit, containing His life, enters into us that we may have the capability of knowing Him from within
The more we know Him, the more we will experience Him as our life, enjoy Him, and allow Him to live out through us
Such knowledge is shallow and outward, for it is not until we see the doings of God that we know what God has done
When Abraham pleaded for Sodom, he recognized that God is righteous, and that He will never act contrary to His righteousness
When we release the word of the Lord, we deeply believe that it shall not be void, but shall accomplish that which the Lord pleases
Such feeling and such knowing did not come from anything outside of him, but from the consciousness given to him by the inward life of God
Consider another brother who in the beginning of a severe difficulty prayed to God, and God carried him through
Though our knowledge of God is in three steps there are actually only two kinds of knowledge the outward knowledge and the inward knowledge
In the original text of the Bible, there are two different words used to describe the inward and outward knowledge
If we simply taste them, we immediately can taste which is sweet and therefore, is sugar, and which is salty and therefore is salt
Hebrews 8 says that the law of the life of God, which is the natural function of the life of God, can cause us to know God
1 John 2 says that the teaching of the anointing, which is the revealing moving of the Holy Spirit, can cause us to know God
When the Holy Spirit anoints and works in us, He always anoints God Himself into us, thus causing us to know God Himself
The law of life and the teaching of the anointing cause us to know from within the nature of God and God Himself
We can see a shadow of these two phases of the knowledge of the nature of God and God Himself in the Old Testament
God gave the law and the prophets in order that the children of Israel might know His nature and Himself through them
Some items speak of the brightness of God, others of the holiness and goodness of God, and still others of the love of God
God used the demanding and forbidding of every item of the law to lead the people of Israel to know every aspect of His nature
God used all kinds of revelation and guidance by the prophets to lead the children of Israel to know Him, His Person
The law says that one should honor his parents, should not kill, should not commit adultery, and should not steal
The prophets may at one time give people one kind of revelation, and at another time give another kind of revelation
They could also make themselves correspond to God Himself and to His will, whether in action or in rest, in work or in battle
Though the law and the prophets of the Old Testament could cause the children of Israel to know God it was all outward knowledge not inward
In New Testament times, God put His Spirit with His life in us, thus enabling us to have an inward knowledge of Him
The law of life, which comes from His life, takes the place of the law of the Old Testament and enables us to know His nature from within
The law of life is a natural characteristic and function of life, and this characteristic of life is the nature of life
When the law of the life of God in us expresses its function and regulates us, it always reveals to us the nature of God
The baby's ability to distinguish between the sour and sweet is not based upon teaching, but upon the natural function of life
When he lived in the life of God in that manner, he then touched the nature of God; in other words, he came to know the nature of God
We all know that anointing is a verbal noun which refers to the activity of the ointment, the moving and the working of the ointment
Since the anointing is the Holy Spirit's working in us, it naturally causes us to have an inner sense so that we may know God and His will
God is unlimited; therefore, the character of the teaching He gives us from working and anointing within us cannot be limited
It can cause us to obtain His revelation and receive His guidance, thereby causing us to know His infinite self and His unlimited will
The result is that it causes not only our action but our whole being to be filled with the element of God and to be in accord with His will
Whenever we touch the question of the manner and taste of living, the law of life makes known to us the nature of God in these matters
Which day they should be married is a question of being guided in action; it is not related to the nature of God
It is not that the first day or the fifteenth day would be in accordance with the nature of God, and all other days would not
Since this is a matter of guidance in action, it is determined by the anointing or the working of the Holy Spirit
Though the law of life and the teaching of the anointing have different functions and are not the same, yet they are very closely related
The law of life originates from the life of God, and the life of God rests upon, and is contained in, the Spirit of God
Since the law of life is the natural function of life, the working of this law within us belongs to the sense of life
It is only when the anointing teaches us that we can comprehend the meaning of the sense given to us by the law of life
On the other hand, the working of the law of life is also related to our comprehension of the teaching of the anointing
The more the law of life works in us the more our growth of life will increase and the more we can comprehend the teaching of the anointing
Let us remember that the law of life and the anointing not only are related to one another, but also influence one another
We have already seen how the law of life and the teaching of the anointing differ, and how they are mutually and reciprocally related
Now we shall see a simple and clear comparison of the knowledge of God given by these two, which will make us even more clear
As we have said before, whether we should or should not buy certain clothing, what day we should have a wedding, etc
It includes almost all the working of God within us, and thus enables us to have a full, rich, and thorough knowledge of God
Even though this inner sense may be absolutely real and true still it needs to be proved by the teaching and the principles of the Scripture
If the consciousness we have within is not in accord with the teaching and principles of the Scripture, we should not accept it
If there is only power inside and no tracks outside, though the train may move, it definitely will rush into calamity
At times our spiritual condition is like the dimness of night within we are as dark as midnight and our inner sense is blurred and unclear
Those who do not love the Lord, who will not pay the price and who will not follow the Lord, are not willing to hear
Many times it is not that God does not speak, that His life does not regulate, or that His anointing does not teach, but that we do not hear
He has already spoken within us but because we do not hear He teaches us from without through men to repeat what He has already said within
Though the outward guidance and the inward teaching are of mutual help to each other, yet the outward cannot take the place of the inward
In the New Testament, there are only the prophets for the church, explaining what God has ordained in principle
The settlement of details is what God, by the law of life and the teaching of the anointing, makes known to every man from within
Though the law of life and the anointing do give us consciousness and teaching from within, we still need the teaching of men from without
The teaching and guidance from within and without are not to substitute for each other, but to have a mutual response
We should not refuse the teaching of men from without simply because we have the law of life and the teaching of the anointing within
As the body has the sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and the soul has the sense of happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy, etc
The sense of the conscience occurs due to questions of right and wrong; the sense of the intuition occurs directly without a cause
The main difference is that the sense of the soul springs from a cause, but the intuition of the spirit is without a cause
The intuition of the spirit is without a cause, which means it is without a means, but is directly present in the deep part of the spirit
Not only is it not influenced by men, events or things from without; it is also not influenced by the sense of the soul
We feel very heavy and depressed, as if the spirit is opposing what our mind thinks, our emotion likes, and our will has determined
Though we know not why, we constantly feel in the spirit a kind of urging and moving, desiring us to carry it out
Revelation is nothing but the Holy Spirit in our spirit showing us the reality of a particular event so that we may comprehend it clearly
Although the inward knowledge is in the intuition of our spirit, it still must be understood by the mind of our soul
The knowing of the intuition in the spirit must have added to it the understanding of the mind in order to have comprehension
We should, in our mind, place before God one by one all the things that we should do and check with the intuition within
If when we come to the matter of visiting the brothers there is a response within, then we understand God wants us to visit some brothers
In this fellowship with God we further bring forward one by one many brothers who we should visit and check with the intuition of the spirit
If the spirit does not respond to any of them we understand that the person God wants us to visit is the brother who has gotten into trouble
Another example is that in prayer you may have a burden, feeling that God wants you to say something to the brothers and sisters
In this way, not only do you have in the intuition the burden of God, but you also understand in the mind the intention of God
When a man is just beginning to learn to interpret the consciousness of the spirit with his mind, he should carry it out in this way
Now that we have seen every aspect of the inward knowledge, we must see the way of practice or the way of obtaining the inward knowledge
The child Samuel, ministering to the Lord, could hear His voice; Mary, quietly sitting at the Lord's feet, could understand the Lord's words
If we can thus turn to the spirit to be near to God, we can actually touch the consciousness of God in the spirit and thereby know God
We must not let our mind, emotion or will lead, but in all things first try to touch the consciousness deep in the spirit
In exercising the spirit, the best practice is prayer, for prayer requires exercising the spirit more than any other activity
If those who practice boxing practice one hour every day, after a certain period of time their fists will be very strong
We have already mentioned that the inward knowledge requires not only the knowing in the spirit, but also the understanding of the mind
If we want to obtain this inward knowledge, we need to exercise our spirit and to renew the understanding of our mind
Colossians 1:9 also shows us that in having 'spiritual understanding' we can 'be filled with the knowledge of his will'
Every imagination of the thoughts of our heart was evil , and our thinking and perception were also filled with the savor of the world
In Romans 12, before the mind is renewed and transformed, we are asked to present our bodies a living sacrifice
The degree to which we allow the cross to abolish our old living, to the same extent the understanding of our mind can be renewed
Originally, it was not related to the spirit, but now the spirit has become 'the spirit of the mind'; therefore, it is connected to the mind
The work of the Spirit within is from center to circumference, which also means from the inner spirit to the outer soul
Whenever God makes something known to us in the intuition of our spirit, the understanding of the mind can immediately understand
In Matthew 11:25, the Lord says that God has hid the spiritual things from the wise and understanding and has revealed them unto babes
It is only when it is rid of its self-satisfaction and stubbornness that we can receive the inward revelation and knowledge of God
The result is that it causes the manner, nature, and taste of our living to be in accord with the nature of God
The result is that it causes our whole person, behavior, and conduct to be filled with the essence of God and agree with the will of God
In addition, we need to deal with our heart that it might be soft and pure, loving God, wanting God, and submissive to God
In addition, through His many servants from without, God teaches or repeats the consciousnesses we feel from within
When we know God in this way, we not only can fully know the will of God, but we can also grow and mature in the life of God
The more we increase in the knowledge of God, the more we will grow in the life of God until He completely occupies us
The essence of God will be fully wrought into us, thus fulfilling that glorious goal of God's desire to be mingled with us as one
Before we see what the growth of life is, however, we shall look at the negative side, what the growth of life is not
He was habitually quick-tempered and easily angered; now his temperament has become slow, and he is no longer quick-tempered
Evil and good, though different in nature, are of the same world; both are other than life, and both are not life
In the Bible, good and evil are not two trees, but one tree; life is another tree, being something of another world, another kingdom
We can say that good and evil on one hand and life on the other hand definitely belong to two different categories
A man, by his own determination and effort, can improve considerably in behavior and yet still be very immature and weak in the life of God
Some believers may be very reverential and devout before God; they dare not be disrespectful or loose in their behavior and action
Formerly a believer was indifferent and cold toward the things of God; now he is enthusiastically pressing on in serving God
Though it is quite precious for a believer to abound in spiritual gifts, such as the ability to minister, heal, speak in tongues, etc
It is the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit descending more upon a believer which causes him to have such gifts
They determine whether or not there is growth of life in a Christian by looking at his behavior, piety, zeal, knowledge, gifts, and power
The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself is blended into us, is gained by us, and has become our element
When we first receive it, this life is still very young and immature, which means that the stature of Christ within us is very small
When we love Christ seek Christ and allow Christ to live in us more and thereby gain us the stature of Christ gradually increases within us
Since this life is Christ who lives in us, the growth of this life is therefore the increase of the stature of Christ within us
The growth of life is not only the increase of the element of God, but also the decrease of the element of man
Her quietness and gentleness were full of human savor and human element; they were entirely the product of human effort
If we want to evaluate the condition of life within a man, it should be like sampling tea: just by a little tasting, you can tell its flavor
Later, he was dealt with by the cross and disciplined by the Holy Spirit through environment so that his natural life was somewhat broken
Once Brother Nee said that it is similar to a man who carelessly walks into a wall; when he does so, his nose always hits first
If his will is particularly strong, whenever he has an encounter, it will certainly be his will that takes the lead
Whenever he encounters something, he is afraid to use the mind, he is afraid to use the emotion, he is afraid to use the will
God regenerates us through His Spirit, and, by this, His life is brought into our spirit; therefore, our spirit is the place where life is
Matthew 13 is the place in the Bible which says distinctly that the heart is related to the growing out of life
If the heart is proper or upright, life can grow out; but if the heart is improper or crooked, life cannot grow out
When we were first saved, a major portion of the lessons we learned, such as making restitution for past debts, clearing our old living, etc
, was to cause us, even from the outset of following the Lord, to deal adequately with the conscience that it be clean and without offense
Whenever we thrust aside the conscience and neglect the conscience, life is immediately blocked and imprisoned
To deal with the conscience means to deal with all the offenses and the restless and uneasy feelings of the conscience
When we have dealt thoroughly with them, our conscience can be exceedingly clean and secure, having neither offense nor accusation
In our actual experience in order to deal with the conscience so that it is wholly clean there is often a situation of overdoing the matter
In this condition, one dares not move or act; with each move comes the feeling of offense, and with each act comes the sense of restlessness
That room was very narrow; even if we were very careful, we could not help splashing a few drops of water on the other person's bed
Indeed, one who wants to have real growth in life must pass through a period of dealing with the conscience in such a severe way
When our conscience has passed through such severe and thorough dealings, its consciousness is more and more sensitive
It is like the glass of a window when it is covered with dust and dirt light cannot penetrate but if we rub it a bit it is a little clearer
The more the conscience is dealt with, the clearer and brighter it becomes and the more sensitive its consciousness is
The more sensitive the conscience is, the softer is the heart, because in every softened heart the conscience is most sensitive
When man's conscience is moved, his heart is also softened; then he is willing to receive the Lord's salvation
Since a sensitive conscience which is without offense can soften the heart, it naturally can allow life to grow out from us
The conscience is the first place through which life passes when it grows out or the first section of the outlet for the growing out of life
If he likes it, he is willing and happy to do it; if he does not like it, he is neither willing nor happy to do it
The Lord wanted to move the emotion of Peter; He desired that Peter would love Him so completely that His life could have a way out from him
Paul's intention here was to tell Timothy that much of the talking of men does not count, but that love and love alone is the end of all
Emotion is the second place through which the growing out of life passes, or the second section of the outlet for the growing out of life
Though in the understanding of God's will, it is a matter of the mind, yet the mind itself cannot directly touch God and know God
It is like the filament in the light bulb which is connected to the light bulb and also belongs to the light bulb
In the meantime, our mind is also clear and proficient; it can immediately interpret the meaning of the intuition in the spirit
Whatever our mind thinks and considers is on the side of the spirit; it no longer yields to the flesh to be employed by the flesh
The mind is the third place through which the growing out of life passes, or the third section of the outlet for the growing out of life
Whether the life of God can grow out from within us is very much related to whether our will is pliable and surrendered
If our will is hard obstinate rebellious and in all things acting according to our own ideas there is no way for the life of God to grow out
If our will is softened, pliable, and willing to act according to the working of life, the life of God can grow out
Our will is the fourth place through which the growing out of life passes, or the fourth section of the outlet for the growing out of life
For this reason, the brothers and sisters today who have growth in life are exceedingly few, and their growth is very slow!
We have said again and again that God's intention in saving us is not for us to be evil men or good men, but to be life-men or God-men
In the very beginning, the Bible mentions two trees in the garden of Eden: one, the tree of life, and the other, the tree of good and evil
The house is the result of conduct, the product of human work, while the tree is an expression of life, of natural growth
The doors and windows of the house are put there by work; the flowers and leaves of the tree arrive there by growth
On the real tree with life many fruits are borne, while on the artificial tree without life someone has placed some fruits
The fruits of both trees have the same form and the same color; there is hardly any difference in outward appearance
The real fruit is tasteful, but the artificial fruit is tasteless; it can only afford to be observed, not tasted
Some sisters come quite close in imitating Madame Guyon's manner of prayer and fellowship, but the smell is not right
Some brothers imitate the humble manners of Jesus the Nazarene but though outwardly they really act the part the smell is missing inwardly
Such are the works of men, not the growth of life; such is the acting out of behavior, not the living out of life
By its taste or smell we can discern whether a Christian's living stems from life or is merely a form of behavior
What is merely of human behavior will fall with the passing of time; either it will change in nature, or it will be destroyed
Such doing and learning did not stem from life, but was due to outward influences and the admiration in my heart
These words are quite meaningful, for in that environment, one will naturally act to be a little more pious and a little more spiritual
Now that we have seen the difference between life and behavior, we should examine our own living and check it point by point
Not only were there birds, fish, beasts, and all kinds of animal life, but also the life of man, who was in the image of God
The light of the first day was not concrete; therefore, it brought in the plant life, the lowest life, a life which is without consciousness
He persuaded man to receive the life of Satan, which was represented by the tree of good and evil, and thus man became corrupted
Within that city there is the light of the glory of God; therefore, there is no need of the light of sun and moon
At the same time in the midst of the street of the city there is a river of water of life and on both sides of the river is the tree of life
All these passages show that there is a line in the whole Bible which continuously speaks of life and light together
We often think that if a man becomes a little more zealous, his life has grown; or if he is a little more pious, his life is improved
Some who preach the Gospel can convince men by their words; yet they cannot cause men to touch from within the shining light of the Gospel
The Word of God we speak of here does not refer to the written word in the Bible, but to the word the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within
Such a Word, composed of mere fixed letters, does not have the power of shining light and cannot be light to us
If we only read the Bible, though we read it thoroughly and even memorize it, what we obtain are but doctrines of letters
Whenever the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within, we should absolutely obey and not be negligent or disobedient
Whenever one who really knows God touches the Word of God, he fears and trembles and dares not refuse or disobey
If we want to be enlightened, we can only wait for God, look unto Him, and trust in Him; there is not a bit more that we can do
Concerning this matter, Isaiah 50:10-11 says: 'Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant?
At the same time, we also cannot borrow the light of others, taking the light others have received as our own for our use
When darkness comes, they do not wait till dawn, till the sun rises; they themselves go to kindle a fire, to make light themselves
Corinthians 4:6 says: 'Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts
The question now is not how we may ask for light or seek light, but how we may obtain enlightening or how we may allow the light to shine
The sun has already risen therefore you need not seek or ask you only need to be shined upon by the light and receive the shining of light
Some do not want it because they are indifferent in heart, and others do not want it because they have made up their mind to reject it
If we do not deal according to the sense of the shining, it means that we are not willing to remove the veils from us
When the heart is not turned toward the Lord, the veil is there; but when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away
They are like a piece of paper which is tightly rolled up, never willing to unfold and allow God to write the words He wants to write
If the room is bright, he cannot see clearly the things outside; if the room is dark, he can see the things outside very clearly
The words they minister and works they do are but dead exhortations which cannot impart to men the living shining
When men are thus unwilling to open themselves to the Lord, they become inwardly waste and void, dark and without light
He is sorrowful because of his own desolation and failure; he worships the Lord because of His mercy and the shining of God
In this way, the light of God continually enlightens him within, and the life of God continually grows within him
Being unable to put a stop to ourselves is also a veil, a serious veil, which prevents us from being enlightened
The Bible clearly says, 'Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ,' but when they read it, it becomes 'Paul, the apostle of Christ Jesus'
When they are not reading the Word of God their opinions are not in evidence but as soon as they read the Word of God their opinions arise
Some brothers and sisters, when listening to the ministry, simply miss all the important and essential points, even after many repetitions
Not only did she have many opinions and feelings, but she also had many words; she could not be stopped for a moment
She immediately had an opinion and answered, 'I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day'
She expounded the Lord's words so wonderfully that the time of resurrection was put off till several thousand years later
When she finished these words she immediately went away and called her sister Mary secretly saying The Teacher is here and calleth thee
Such people cannot stop a bit; thus, they are totally veiled from the light, and there is really no way for them to be enlightened
That is why they become today the most serious veil in us; they render us unable to obtain the shining of the Lord
Not only should our outward activities be stopped; even the opinions, feelings, ideas, views and words within us should be stopped
When a person who is completely stopped comes before the Lord, he can be exceedingly simple and single in receiving the word of the Lord
When he reads the Bible, he does not read his own opinion and explanation into it; rather, he reads the meaning in the Bible into himself
When the words are released, he can grasp the essential point of the message and receive from within the Lord's word
As soon as we have the enlightening and sense within we should immediately accept submit and deal accordingly we cannot have any disputation
To cause the Holy Spirit to withdraw by resisting Him is extremely easy, but to ask Him to return is quite difficult
Even if we confess, repent, and thereby obtain the Lord's forgiveness, the Holy Spirit may still not come back immediately
Not only does the Holy Spirit work in this way; even those who have the ministry of the Holy Spirit work in this way
If you criticize him or intentionally resist him, he will not contend with you, reason with you, or argue concerning right or wrong
He has only one way: He simply withdraws, having nothing more to say to you and being no longer able to help you
Toward both the Holy Spirit who speaks within us and the ministers who speak without, we cannot engage in criticism or dispute
When they reached Kadesh-barnea, the hand of God's government came forth: they could only return to the wilderness to wander
When in a particular matter we receive shining and thereby come to know the will of God, it is not a matter of obeying once, and that is all
If before the Lord we pay careful attention to these five points, we can obtain frequent enlightening and live in the light
