   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have seen three important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Mount of Transfiguration involved the matter of the content of Christianity, the house involved the matter of the foundation of Christianity, and Caesarea involved the matter of the sphere of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The foundation of Christianity is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The content of Christianity is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no Moses or Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But for whom are these blessings?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These blessings are for the whole human race.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We often think that it is possible for certain people to receive the gospel, but not possible for other people to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have thought that a person ought to be changed and adjusted before he can become a Christian, or that certain people have to make some adjustments before they can become a candidate for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has shown us that a Gentile does not need to become a Jew before he can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Gentile can become a Christian immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today no Gentile needs to be a Jew; he can be a Christian immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people think that a man must first be converted to Judaism before he can become a Christian, and that he cannot jump from being a Gentile to being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But thank the Lord that grace is always given to those who are standing on a lower ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we are standing on a lower ground, grace is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as we are on the lower ground, we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank the Lord that we can all come to God just as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no difference between a Jew and a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need to improve ourselves or to change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have to be a Jew before we can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can come today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After his experience Peter realized that a person can be saved as long as he is a sinner; no one has the privilege of receiving special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter thought that there was a special, privileged class and a class who was set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Jews are sinners in the same way that Gentiles are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 3 says that there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles; they are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Jews thought that they were privileged sinners, while Gentiles were unprivileged sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But thank the Lord, privileged or unprivileged, the Holy Spirit has fallen upon all the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All have received the Holy Spirit, and there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is anyone here this morning who is not yet saved, and who thinks that you have to advance to a certain state or change to a certain condition before being saved, you are absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need to change or improve at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just come as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is all you have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is indeed a great privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, there is no distinction of nationality in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no separation of men into Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet today some are inventing something like the Chinese Christian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I once met a very good man who told me that he was organizing a Chinese Christian Church in his locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I told him that it was an antique.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said that what he was starting was not an antique, because they had just started it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I told him that it was not only an antique, but a museum piece, good only for the museum.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is China, there is no Christian Church, and if there is the Christian Church, there is no China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is not the Chinese Christian Church a monster?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are in Christ, there is no China, and if we are in China, there is no Christian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can there be a Chinese Christian Church?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the church is built upon Jesus Christ, there cannot be a Chinese Christian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Christ there is no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How do you come to God today?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How did you become saved?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The only basis for you to come before God is that you have partaken of the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have become God's children through the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, you are children of God before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not matter whether you are a Jew or a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have become a child of God through the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No matter what color your skin is or what type your blood is, everyone who comes to God comes on the basis of the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone's sins are washed through the blood of the Lord Jesus, and everyone comes to God by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not receive grace because we are Chinese, or because we are foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We obtain grace because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Christ there is no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we come to God through a foreigner or a Chinese, perhaps that foreigner or Chinese can claim a share of the merit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the Bible says that we all are what we are because of one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is only one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must say that some of the things that are in the church today are not necessarily the things that will be there in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have pointed out before that a Cyrenian was a black person, while Manaen was raised up with the king Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In addition there was a good man, Barnabas, and a highly educated man, Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They were all in the church, and there was no distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we see this, and if God's children today see this, that is, if we see our oneness in Christ, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we speak of oneness or unity, is it a matter of me obeying you or you obeying me?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are you right or am I right?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are left to ourselves, we can never be one.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thank the Lord that we are already one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have to repeat this word already a thousand and even ten thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are already one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We were one in Christ long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You are related to Christ before God, and I am also related to Christ before God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is why the Bible never exhorts Christians to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Is not this interesting?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is no place in the Bible which says that we should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, it says that we should maintain the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not need to create a oneness; we could never be one.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But thank the Lord that we have received the same life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, we are already one.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Friends, there is not only a difference between the Chinese and the foreigners; there are also the differences between rich and poor, free and slaves, and wise and foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If there are such differences in the church, the church is no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I wish that among us the rich, poor, wise, foolish, free, and slaves could all say that we are brothers and that we all have the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Some time ago, I was working in one place, and some government officials were telling me that they could not go to the ordinary churches.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I asked them why, and they said that others were common citizens, while they were officials.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I asked them what they wanted to do, and they said that they intended to donate five or six thousand dollars to build a meeting hall and invite a pastor to come.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I asked them what they would do with the name of the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They said that they had not thought about this yet.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I asked if I could suggest a name for them, and they agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I then proposed to call it "The Church of the Officials."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They said that this did not sound right.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then I said that if the name was not right, the people within were not right either.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today everyone who is in Christ is the same; there cannot be any distinction based on differences in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thank the Lord that in the Bible there are only the churches in Judea; there are no Judean churches.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>These churches are in the land of Judea, but these churches do not belong to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Thank God that there are churches in China, but there is no church of China; there are churches in England, and there are churches in America, but there is no church of England or church of America.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If there is, the sphere of Christianity will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We thank the Lord that the foundation of Christianity is Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Without this, there is no Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We thank the Lord that the content of Christianity is Christ Himself as our personal revelation and guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Without this, there is no Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We also thank the Lord that the sphere of Christianity includes all regenerated and saved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Tonight when we come together to break the bread, if we only see the group of people who are with us, we do not have the right to touch this bread.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What we are touching is the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we only see our own group, we do not have the qualification to touch this bread.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our heart should be broad enough to include all of God's children, and we should declare that they all are our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We cannot have any concept of differences in class, race, social status, or intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There cannot be these things in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The Holy Spirit has descended upon us in the same way that He has descended upon others; there cannot be any distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>All distinctions are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We cannot say that we are this way and others are that way.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Please do not bring the things of Adam into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we bring the things of Adam into the church, the church will not be helped, but will be damaged instead.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>May the Lord bless all of us.</S>
