   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>35 Raising Them Up and Presenting Them to Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through the divine dispensing God also raises the believers up and presents them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Corinthians 4:14 Paul says, "Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons, for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their only hope was in the God who raised up the Lord Jesus and who would also raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They lived with this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Corinthians 1:9 Paul testifies of his experience of being raised up by God: "We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Literally, the Greek word translated "sentence" means answer or response.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the apostles were under the pressure of affliction, despairing even of life, they may have asked themselves what the issue of the suffering would be.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer, or response, was death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to their estimation, they were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was a self-insight that led to a particular vital decision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It caused them to have no confidence in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as they were concerned, there was no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their confidence was in God, who raises the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The experience of death ushers us into the experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Resurrection is the very God who, through His dispensing, resurrects the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The working of the cross terminates the self that we may experience God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The experience of the cross always issues in the enjoyment of the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>36 Fashioning, Shaping, Preparing, Making Them Fit, for Their Mortal Body to Be Swallowed Up by Life</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God fashions, shapes, prepares, makes the believers fit, for their mortal body to be swallowed up by life 2 Cor 5:4b-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2 Corinthians 5:4b Paul says, "That what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here "what is mortal" denotes our mortal body 2 Cor 4:11; Rom 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have our mortal body swallowed up by life is to have it transfigured by resurrection life swallowing up the death in our mortal body 1 Cor 15:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our fallen, mortal body is a great burden to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under the weight of this burden, we groan that we would be clothed with a transfigured body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are raptured, transfigured, and clothed with the heavenly, spiritual, and resurrected body, then that which is mortal will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Corinthians 5:5 Paul goes on to say, "Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word rendered "wrought" can also be translated fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has wrought us, fashioned us, shaped us, prepared us, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body may be swallowed up by His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, our entire being will be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has given us the Spirit as the pledge of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God prepares us for our mortal body to be swallowed up by life by dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually the Christ who dwells in us will grow in us and saturate our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the preparation for Christ's saturating our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, when we are transfigured, we shall be clothed with a spiritual body outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, transfiguration means that the indwelling Christ is saturating our body and swallowing up the element of death in it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has been sown into our spirit and heart, and now He is saturating our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then one day He will spread from the soul into the body and saturate the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When our body has been saturated in full, it will become a new body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The One who fashions, shapes, prepares, makes us fit for this is God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit is the guarantee that God will accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, actually God has put Himself into our being as the guarantee that He will change our body so that we shall be entirely conformed to Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may believe, according to 2 Corinthians 5:4, that our mortal body will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we still need to see that for this purpose God needs to shape us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's fashioning of us for the future in which our mortal body will be swallowed up by life is also God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to pray, "Lord, prepare me, make me fit, for the day when my mortal body will be swallowed up by life and transfigured."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, our body will be transfigured into the form of Christ's glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today God is shaping, fashioning, us for this by dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
