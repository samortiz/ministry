   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Is the church built that way?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Far from it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is the way the church is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the source of the trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the absence of the throne!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Judges we read: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes" Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When there was no king in Israel, there was no authority, and the people just did as they pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time a certain family set up a place of worship in their own home, hired a Levite to be their household priest, and there they instituted a form of "divine worship" Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is exactly the state of things in the present day!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We think if we are just keen enough, we can gather some people together, and you can set up a church on this street, and I can set up a church on that street, and we can hire a preacher to preach for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, what is the cause of all this confusion?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ultimate cause is that we have not subjected ourselves to the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But let us return to our illustration of the two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If those two had both come into subjection to the church's Head, their problems would have been solved, for authority quells all rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh, what rebel stuff there is in our make-up!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I confess that my own nature is utterly antagonistic to the Lord, but His authority over me has brought me to love my brethren, so that I can truly serve Him together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, we talk about mutual love, but this love of ours one for the other is very transient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is only one place where love is permanent, and that is under the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nowhere else is there true harmony or permanent relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are willing to be broken under His authority, something tremendous happens a building process begins to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A constant acceptance of the discipline of His government makes way for the flow of His life, and so the building work goes on apace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those brothers and sisters who have been our problems become our blessings, and it is not long before a company is built up in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, this is what God desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not enough that we preach the gospel, bring people to a knowledge of salvation, and to a measure of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must also bring them under the headship of Christ so that they may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under His headship we shall cease to reckon with difficulties, for we shall touch fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the specific spiritual function which belongs to each member of the Body will become apparent, and this local church will become a strong church in which, under the direction of the Head, every member, from the smallest to the greatest, will have a contribution to make to the whole.</S>
