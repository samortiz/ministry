[1]  CONTENTS Knowing the Economy of God Concerning the Economy of God Four Great Matters in the Bible The Truth of the Mystery in the Gospel of John 1 The Truth of the Mystery in the Gospel of John 2 The Truth of the Mystery in the Gospel of John 3 The Divine Dispensing in the Book of Ephesians The Mystery of the Divine Trinity in the Gospel of Matthew Learning Our Spiritual Experiences in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity Being a Living Witness of the Lord Becoming a Useful Vessel in the Lord's Hand 1 Becoming a Useful Vessel in the Lord's Hand 2
[2]  Following this, the book proceeds to offer guidance to all those who have a heart to serve the Lord full time concerning the building up of themselves in the matters of life, truth, character, learning languages, knowing the church, living a healthy life, and managing personal finances as living witnesses of the Lord, so that they may become useful vessels in the Lord's hands.
[3]  Although this series of messages was released in the full-time training, the speaking concerning the economy of God and the mystery of the transmission of the Divine Trinity, as well as the words of earnest instruction to the full-time serving ones concerning life, truth, character, living, and finances are topics and lessons intimately related to all of the children of God today.
[4]  A follower of the Lord must be a pursuer, and there are at least a few things that he must pursue throughout his entire life: life, truth, the filling of the Holy Spirit, character training, and the knowledge of God's eternal economy.
[5]  The chapters of each book of the Scriptures are also divinely arranged.
[6]  The things that are stated explicitly, of course, have profound significance; however, certain things that are not mentioned are even more profound in their significance.
[7]  For instance, Genesis 14 tells us that when Abraham returned after winning a battle, Melchisedec, the king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, went to meet him, ministered bread and wine to him, and blessed him vv.
[8]  Third, we need to be filled with the Holy Spirit daily, to "buy oil" every day.
[9]  There was a certain kind of sculpture in the ancient times which was made by grinding stones into powder, adding a cementing element to the powder, and then putting the compound into a mold until it solidified into a statue.
[10]  Hence, from this viewpoint, character is not cultivated by having a strong will or by ill-treating the body.
[11]  Rather, character is the issue of transformation in our pursuing of the Lord.
[12]  Because we love the Lord, God arranges our marriage and our family in such a way so that we can be broken and be transformed.
[13]  After we have the Lord's life and Spirit in us, we begin to receive the breaking and the consuming, so that the Lord, in His life, can add more of Himself as the Spirit into us for our transformation, which issues in the character that God wants.
[14]  Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times," and 3:9 says, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things."
[15]  Another set of years in the Bible that deserves our study is the seventy weeks in Daniel 9.
[16]  In this period the rebuilding of the holy city Jerusalem, with street and trench, was completed v. 25 . Then the second part, composed of sixty-two weeks, is four hundred thirty-four years following the first seven weeks and ending with the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus the year when the anointed One, Messiah, was cut off v. 26a . This means that four hundred years after the first seven weeks, the Lord Jesus was born.
[17]  We have already seen what God's economy is, and we have also seen the dispensations of God in His economy in four ages.
[18]  Not only do we need to be familiar with these verses and their contents so that we may fully know the truth contained in them, but we also need to be constituted with this truth by constantly pondering over and being exercised in these verses in order to be able to further explain and preach this truth to others.
[19]  The Coming of the New Jerusalem in Two Stages
[20]  The Triune God dispenses Himself through His Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE FOUR GREAT MATTERS IN THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; John 14:16-20; 16:13-15; Matt 28:19; Eph 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-6.
[22]  The One into whom we believe is the divine and mysterious Triune God.
[23]  Because it pleased the Triune God to reveal Himself to His children, He used the limited language of mankind to make known, in time, His heart's desire in the Bible.
[24]  When we study the whole New Testament in depth, we can see that He revealed four great matters: first, the economy of God; second, the dispensing of God; third, the union of God with the believers; and fourth, the corporate expression of God.
[25]  THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST TELLING PEOPLE TO REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS WHICH WAS DRAWING NEAR
[26]  ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD, NOT THROUGH TEACHING BUT THROUGH REGENERATION
[27]  If we desire to serve the Lord and walk on His way for our whole life, we must have a pure knowledge of the Word according to God's revelation.
[28]  To Repent Being to Have a Change of Concept
[29]  When the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God," He seemed to be saying, "Nicodemus, you are wrong.
[30]  Our Understanding concerning the Kingdom of God Being Incomplete
[31]  In the past we had a considerable amount of knowledge concerning the kingdom of God, and although our understanding was not wrong, it was definitely incomplete.
[32]  For example, when you are going to steal, He would not let you; when you are going to lose your temper, He would not allow you; when you are furious and are going to speak some angry words, He would stop you; when you are going to do a bad thing or say a bad word, He would warn you first, and if you refuse to listen, then He would chastise you.
[33]  If we desire to know the Bible and God's economy, we must change our natural, human, religious, and moral concepts so that we may receive God's revelation.
[34]  The shepherd signifies Christ, the Son, coming to find us. the woman signifies the Holy Spirit thoroughly illuminating us within. and the father signifies God the Father receiving us, fallen men, back to His house.
[35]  The council of the Divine Trinity was concerned directly with the four great matters in the Bible: the economy of God, the dispensing of God, the mingling of God with the believers, and the corporate expression of God.
[36]  The Bible does not say that while the Father was creating, the Son was standing and watching, and the Spirit was not doing anything.
[37]  The Image of God Being His Beloved Son Christ
[38]  The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation.
[39]  The first main section of the Gospel of John is divided into five sub-sections: first, "Introduction to life and building" ch.
[40]  The Word Being in the Beginning, and the Word Being God
[41]  With respect to the Lord's relationship to us, the first aspect of the mystery in the Gospel of John, as shown in the outline, is that the Lord Jesus is the Word.
[42]  The second crucial verse concerning Christ being the Spirit is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, "The Lord is the Spirit."
[43]  "The Lord" here, of course, is Jesus, and "the Spirit" is the Spirit who gives life, mentioned in verse 6, and who is the life-giving Spirit.
[44]  Furthermore, the Lord said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" v. 10b . This simply means that the Son speaks while the Father works.
[45]  THOSE WHO BELIEVE INTO THE SON DOING GREATER WORKS DISPENSING CHRIST THROUGH SPEAKING
[46]  In John 14:11-12 the Lord says, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.
[47]  Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father."
[48]  From the context of these verses we understand that doing greater works does not refer to doing greater miracles but to speaking, because previously the Lord said that the Son is speaking while the Father who abides in the Son is working.
[49]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 2 THE COINHERENCE OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT
[50]  On the surface John 14:16-20, 23, and 26 seem to be easy to understand, but actually these verses contain a very critical truth.
[51]  However, in verse 16a He said, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter," seeming to imply that He was one person and the Father was another person.
[52]  The World Beholding Him No Longer, but Those Who Believe into Him Beholding Him
[53]  In verse 19a the Lord explained, saying, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer."
[54]  On the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and breathed into them the promised Spirit, His very reality.
[55]  In John 14:20 the Lord said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
[56]  However, "in that day," that is, about thirty hours later, in the day of the Lord's resurrection, the disciples knew that the Lord was not only in the Father but also in them, because the Lord breathed Himself into them 20:22 . as a result, they were also in Him.
[57]  This proves that when you love the Son, you love the Father also, because the Father is in the Son. at the same time, because the Son is in the Father, the result is that the Father as well as the Son respond to your love by loving you.
[58]  THE FATHER SENDING THE SPIRIT IN THE NAME OF THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT COMING WITH THE FATHER AND THE SON
[59]  In John 14:26, a verse which is even harder to understand than the previous verses we have covered, the Lord said, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things."
[60]  This verse tells us that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son's name; thus, the Spirit is also in the Son's name.
[61]  The above illustration helps us to see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God the Triune God to be our food.
[62]  The wheat is ground into flour, the flour is made into bread, and this bread denotes Christ as the individual bread, which after being eaten by us, constitutes us a corporate bread.
[63]  John 16:12-15 says, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
[64]  But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.
[65]  After receiving all that the Son has, the Spirit comes to "declare" it to us. this means that He comes to transmit it to us.
[66]  This means that all that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit have are all conveyed and transmitted into us by the Spirit.
[67]  The riches in the Father are transmitted into the Son; then all that is in the Son is transmitted into the Spirit of reality; finally when the Spirit of reality comes, He transmits into us all that He has obtained and all that He possesses.
[68]  In order to receive the divine transmission, every morning we must spend time to contact the Lord.
[69]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS THE DIVINE TRINITY BEING THE CONSTITUENT OF THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS
[70]  In time the Son redeemed us for accomplishing what the Father had planned, and after the Son accomplished redemption, the Spirit came to seal us and be a pledge to us for the application of what the Son accomplished.
[71]  Therefore, this verse points out concisely and accurately that we have access unto the Father through the Son, who accomplished redemption, and in the Spirit, who is the sealing and leading; that is, through the Son we have access in one Spirit unto the Father.
[72]  In chapter three we see a very deep relationship and union, as well as a profound transmission, dispensing, and mingling between the Triune God and us.
[73]  Verses 14 to 19 say, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."
[74]  Sometimes we may want to say something that sounds nicer, so we ask Him according to His holiness; other times we see something unpleasant and become angry, so we may ask Him according to His righteousness and justice; and sometimes we pay attention to power, so we may ask the Lord according to His power.
[75]  The Glorification of the Lord Being the Bearing of Much Fruit
[76]  The glory of God is truly a great topic.
[77]  One is in Matthew 5 7, the teaching on the mountain concerning the truth of the kingdom; the other is in John 14 16, the Lord's speaking to His disciples on the night that He was betrayed concerning the mystery of the union of the Triune God with His believers.
[78]  Moreover, Paul asked the Father to grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man.
[79]  Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts through Faith That We May Be Rooted and Grounded in Love
[80]  The first time he used it is in verse 16 when he prayed that the Father would grant us "to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."
[81]  Apprehending the Breadth, Length, Height, and Depth of Christ
[82]  Once the Lord has made His home in our hearts, Paul continued to say, the result is that we are "full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are" Eph 3:18 .
[83]  Being Filled unto the Fullness of the Triune God
[84]  Verse 19b says, "That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."
[85]  In the preceding verses Paul referred to the mystery of the Divine Trinity: he prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ the Son may make His home in our hearts, and that we would be filled unto all the fullness of God unto the expression of all the riches of God.
[86]  This is not merely the fullness of the Father, nor of the Son, nor of the Spirit; this is the fullness of God, the fullness of the Divine Trinity.
[87]  In chapter one, it is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; in chapter two, it is the Son, the Spirit, and the Father; in chapter three, it is the Father, the Spirit, and the Son; and in chapter four, it is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father.
[88]  The matter of the Triune God is not a superficial theological doctrine.
[89]  After studying the Bible in depth for many years, I have seen that baptizing people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is far more meaningful than simply baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[90]  The Mystery of the Divine Trinity in Matthew 3
[91]  While it is not easy to find references to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in Matthew 2, the revelation concerning the Divine Trinity in Matthew 3 is very clear.
[92]  Matthew 3:16-17 says, "And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.
[93]  This portion reveals the Triune God and is a picture of the Divine Trinity the Son rose up from the water, the Spirit descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke concerning the Son from heaven.
[94]  However, I hope we all can see that although Matthew 3 definitely says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in three different places, John 10 says that the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father v. 38 . This verse reveals that They are in one another mutually.
[95]  CHAPTER NINE LEARNING OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES IN THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY
[96]  Concerning the dispensing of the Triune God, there are a few more crucial verses 2 Corinthians 13:14 and Revelation 1:4-5.
[97]  The word spirit is not that simple in the Chinese translation.
[98]  Two thousand years ago, God who is Spirit was not yet processed, but today after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, God as the Spirit has already passed through four major steps incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[99]  OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES NEEDING TO BE IN THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[100]  The life of Christ in us is altogether a story of the Spirit; it is not a matter of seeking to be perfect through ethical pursuits, and it has nothing to do with the personal cultivation of morality.
[101]  THE LEARNING AND EXERCISE NEEDED BY THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE LORD
[102]  It is true that the church and the saints will follow the Lord's leading to supply us in love; nevertheless, we still have to learn to trust in God.
[103]  In your coordination with the brothers and sisters who work with you, you should also exercise faith and not have your own choice.
[104]  CHAPTER TEN BEING A LIVING WITNESS OF THE LORD A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN TAIWAN
[105]  Although I had dealt with the situation, I did not entirely pick up the work in Taiwan again.
[106]  To fulfill such a plan, first we have to build up the home meetings, and second we have to teach the truth.
[107]  It is really a great blessing to all the full-time trainees who have just finished their college education and are about to start a new stage in their life to set apart some time to be trained to know the Lord and serve Him.
[108]  Concerning the matter of holding a job, we all must have the apostle Paul's spirit of tent-making.
[109]  We should not think about making big money and becoming rich people but simply earn our livelihood so that we can live for the Lord on the earth.
[110]  If the Lord calls us for a need after we have been working for a few years, we should present ourselves to the Lord right away.
[111]  CHAPTER ELEVEN BECOMING A USEFUL VESSEL IN THE LORD'S HAND 1
[112]  It is crucial for anyone who is truly saved, loves the Lord, and desires to serve the Lord all his life to know how to become a useful vessel in the Lord's hand.
[113]  Those who are known as the fundamentalists have four characteristics: first, they have deep faith in the Bible, believing the literal meaning of the words; second, they believe in the existence of God; third, they believe in the divinity of the Lord Jesus; and fourth, they believe that the death of the Lord Jesus was not merely the death of a martyr but was for redemption.
[114]  With regard to the fundamental faith, even the Catholic Church may be considered fundamental because she also believes in the Bible as the word of God, in the existence of God, in the divinity of the Lord Jesus, and in the redemption accomplished by the Lord Jesus.
[115]  This shows us that we should be orthodox, not only related to the fundamental truths but also in the matter of life.
[116]  In order to go forth to work for the Lord, first we must equip ourselves that we may be enriched in the knowledge of the truth.
[117]  If we do this, whenever we speak, we will be able to present the truth clearly and reasonably, and those who hear us will also be convinced.
[118]  Besides pursuing the growth in life and being equipped in the truth, as mentioned in the preceding chapter, we also need to build up several other things if we want to be useful vessels in the Lord's hand.
[119]  Third, we must develop a habit and build up a life of praying every day, fellowshipping with the Lord all the time, confessing our sins to the Lord constantly, and enjoying the infilling of the Holy Spirit at every moment.
[120]  We may have growth in life, the infilling of the Holy Spirit, fellowship with the Lord without any barrier, a good character, and constitution with truth; however, if we do not have a good command of language, this will be a shortcoming.
[121]  When I say that we must have a good command of language, I am referring not only to foreign languages but also to our mother tongue.
[122]  If we intend to speak for the Lord but do not have an adequate vocabulary, even if we have a great deal of knowledge within us, we will not be able to adequately express any of it.
[123]  Furthermore, while you should avoid overeating, you should not allow your stomach to be empty.
[124]  Do not think that because you are still young, you are strong enough to hold yourself up.
[125]  Finally, we have to learn how to spend our money properly.
