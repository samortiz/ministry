   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How the Bride of Christ Comes into Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Genesis 2 there is the picture of how the bride of Christ comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before God prepared a bride for Adam, He brought all the beasts and animals to Adam, and Adam named each one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But none of these created things matched Adam, and they could not be his counterpart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam v. 21 . Adam is a type of Christ Rom 5:14 , and his sleep is a type of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, sleep means death 1 Cor 15:18; 1 Thes 4:13-16; John 11:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During Adam's sleep, God took one of his ribs from his side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, when Christ was sleeping on the cross, something came out of His side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 19:34 tells us that when the soldier pierced His side, out came blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At Adam's time there was no sin, so there was no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not until Genesis 3 that sin came in. Thus, all that came out of Adam's side was the rib without the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, by the time that Christ was sleeping on the cross, there was the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, His death must deal with this sin problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The blood came out of Christ's side for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following the blood the water came out, which is the flowing life to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This divine, flowing, uncreated life is typified by the rib taken out of Adam's side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, two others were dying with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their legs were broken, but when the soldier came to the Lord Jesus, He was already dead and there was no need to break His bones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This fulfilled the prophecy that not one of His bones would be broken John 19:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the bone taken out of Adam's side signifies the Lord's unbroken, unbreakable, resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His resurrection life is unbreakable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rib taken out of Adam signifies the resurrection life, and God built a woman with the rib of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now God builds up the church with the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as Eve was a part of Adam, so the church is a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eve was bone of Adam's bones and flesh of Adam's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we as the church are a part of Christ Eph 5:30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This marvelous revelation can be seen by comparing Genesis 2, John 19, and Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into us as the resurrection life, the unbreakable life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is this life that transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life is the tree of life, the river of life, the very life that supplies us and that flows within us to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Day by day as we enjoy this flowing, divine, uncreated, unbreakable life, we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This transformation is mentioned and revealed in Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we are being transformed, we are also being built into the church to be the bride to satisfy Christ as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of Genesis 2 is Eve, and at the end of the entire Bible is the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate Eve, the ultimate consummation of the universal bride built up with precious materials produced by the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life seen in Genesis 2 is the flowing life, the transforming life, and the building life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life flows within us, transforms us, and eventually builds us up as the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This bride, the New Jerusalem, will fulfill the two aspects of the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the New Jerusalem will be the full expression of God in God's full image Rev 21:11; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, this New Jerusalem will subdue the enemy, conquer the earth, and exercise God's authority over the entire universe, especially over the creeping things Rev 22:5; 21:15; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>21:8; 20:10, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's dominion will be realized on the whole earth through the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, God's purpose is fully fulfilled by the New Jerusalem, which is the result, the issue, the ultimate consummation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we believers need is life, and this life is nothing less than the Triune God Himself, the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we all be brought into the enjoyment and experience of this flowing, transforming, and building life to be prepared as the bride that will bring Christ back.</S>
