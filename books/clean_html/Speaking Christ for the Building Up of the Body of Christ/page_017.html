<h2 class="head1">THE COMPOSITION OF THE GOSPEL TEAMS</h2>
<p>As a rule, each gospel team that goes out should be composed of three persons of different ages, a young one, an old one, and one in the middle. Ideally the youngest should be a sister, the middle one a brother, and the third one an older brother or sister. The older one is for the opening of the doors. If a team of three young men goes out, almost no doors will be opened to them. People may be afraid of them and not dare to open their doors. However, if an older brother or sister would go with them, many doors will be open. Many doors are open especially to an older sister. We have found out that the older sisters are very valuable in visiting people with the gospel.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our training, we knew this in principle. We arranged for every team to have an older one. Eventually we discovered that the older ones are welcomed everywhere. The older one should knock on the door while the younger ones stand back. Once inside a house, it is best if the young sister speaks. We have found on many occasions that the most prevailing ones to bring people into the faith were the young sisters. The brothers are mostly good for putting people into the water of baptism. When the young or middle-aged brother would go to baptize people, either the young sister or the older brother or sister should help to prepare the water.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>There are a few instructions we should follow in door-knocking. First, at each door knock three times not using more than half a minute. If the door does not open, immediately turn to the next door. Do not waste time. Then when a door is opened to you and you enter and begin to speak, learn to sense whether there is the possibility that this person will get baptized that day. You may sense that there is no possibility on that day, although he might be a son of peace two weeks later. Perhaps you will find out that he just quarreled with his wife. While you were knocking, they were still quarreling. When you entered, you entered into a fighting situation. How could this person be a son of peace this day? Even if he was chosen, this may not be the time for him to be called. Do not foolishly waste your time. After five minutes at the most, you could realize that was the wrong time to talk to him. You should not stay, but nicely tell him that you will come to visit another time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may find a Christian who has been in the faith for ten years, attending a denomination. This one may be very talkative and tell you that he loves the truth, admires your practice of visiting people, and many other things. When you hear this, simply greet the brother and leave. Usually, you will gain nothing by talking with such a person; you will waste your time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will have knocked on nineteen doors without gaining one person. Quite often nothing happens up to the last door. One hour and ten minutes might have been used, with less than a half hour of your time left. Do not give up. Try two or three more doors. Quite often the Lord would test us. Up to the last door there may only be ten minutes left, but when you get into this door, everything is in the heavens. Here is a son of peace, and the rest is easy. I have often heard this kind of testimony. One sister suffered six nights without getting one person. She prayed and fasted, and eventually the seventh night her team baptized about six people. In the first home there were three baptisms.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING FRUIT FOR A ONEFOLD INCREASE YEARLY</h2>
<p>In every team that goes out for the gospel, there should be at least one local saint. Saints from other localities or full-timers may be gone the following week, and the new babes would be left as orphans. We must be clear that when we knock on doors, we local saints are the nursing mothers of the new ones whom we bring to the Lord. After going out to knock on doors, we will have new babes to take care of. Whoever is gained will be our child.</p>
<p>We can visit people about two weekends every three months to get about two new believers. Every three months, we should go out to knock on doors. We do not need to go out every week. In the first three months we will have one or two new ones to take care of. Then in the next three months, we will bring in another one or two. We will then have three or four under our care. In each three-month period, we will gain one or two new ones. In this way, the saints will preach the gospel by visiting people throughout the year. Each one will have some babes under his care.</p>
<p>Suppose that everyone who means business with the Lord for His recovery would preach the gospel in this way. This would be wonderful. At least one fourth of the church would do it, so out of one hundred meeting together, twenty-five will go out. Each of these twenty-five will gain about four persons, or about one every three months. I believe each one will get more than four, but there will be four that remain. You may get seven or nine, but at the end of the year four will still remain. Do not forget the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15:16: &ldquo;I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; To go forth is to visit people; to have remaining fruit is through the home meetings. I have found through the years that the most confident way to gain people is by knocking on their doors and that the most certain way to keep those that we gain is through the home meetings. To go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors is the scientific way to get the increase, and to have the home meetings is the scientific way to have remaining fruit. Twenty-five out of one hundred saints, each bringing in four persons, will yield a one hundred percent increase, a onefold increase.</p>
<p>In Manila when I proposed to the saints to bring one sinner to the Lord yearly, I did not have the assurance that they could do it. However, I have the assurance this can be done in the new way. It depends upon your doing. I do not expect that all the saints meeting in a local church will go out for the gospel. This is not possible. Some might not be so strong, some might be sick, and some might be otherwise occupied. However, in general, twenty-five percent of our manpower can gain a onefold yearly increase for the church.</p>
<p>This way is not too hard. Every team that goes out for the gospel will get one person if they do it properly. Within two and a half hours you can knock on thirty doors. You have to manage your time. Do not stay in a home more than five minutes unless you find a son of peace. This son of peace is worth staying with for one hour. Your staying with him will lay a good foundation and will open the entire home for further visits.</p>
