We all love the Lord and we are in the Lord's recovery, and we all keep the truth and teach the truth; yet the rate of increase among us is too low. Nearly everywhere it is the same. The rate of increase measures where we are. How much we need to consider our ways (Hag. 1:5, 7) and humble ourselves before the Lord! How much we need to come out of our local boundaries, out of our independence, and practice the oneness of the Body by being blended together! The blending through the clustering among the churches, and the fellowship among the churches, should be as much as practicality allows, without boundaries of cities, states, provinces, or nations.</P><P>The clustering of the churches for blending does not mean that we practice the federation of the churches by uniting the churches, like the federation of the fifty states of the United States. We do not practice federation, but we do practice the local churches as the one Body of Christ. In this practice the clustering and moving together of the neighboring churches should be as much as possible without the abolishing of the local administration in business affairs. In Southern California there are fifty-one local churches. Some are very small, with not more than fifteen saints. Others have twenty-five, thirty, or fifty, and a few have one or two hundred. Furthermore, these churches are close to one another geographically; that is, they are in the same neighborhood with one another. Recently, the churches in Southern California have begun to practice to be blended together by clustering on the Lord's Day. The result has been that in this blending the churches are strengthened and the impact is brought in.</P><P>In the book of Revelation the Lord Jesus clustered and blended the seven churches together as one. He wrote seven letters, one letter to each of the seven churches, and yet He put all the seven letters together as the one total Epistle and sent it to all seven churches that they might all receive the same fellowship (Rev. 1:4, 11; 2:1&#151;3:22). In the eyes of the Lord all the seven local churches were just one church because He has only one Body. Furthermore, the apostle Paul also blended the two churches in Laodicea and Colossae together. He wrote a letter to the church in Laodicea and asked the church in Laodicea to let Colossae read it. He also wrote a letter to the church in Colossae and asked Colossae to let Laodicea read it (Col. 4:16).</P><P>The principle of blending is also set forth in the Old Testament. There God blended the twelve tribes together as one, and He commanded them to come together three times a year in Jerusalem on Mount Zion (Deut. 16:16). All the Israelites brought the rich produce of the good land to offer to God and to share with one another for the mutual encouragement and mutual enjoyment. No doubt, whenever the time of these feasts arrived, all the people were full of joy. Even before coming to Mount Zion, while they were ascending they would sing Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity...For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: life forever" (vv. 1, 3b). In this way of blending, the oneness of the people of Israel was preserved and expressed.</P><P>In the blending of the churches we receive nourishment, we receive revelation, and we receive a vision of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ and the church. Such a blending is not only for our own mutual spiritual benefit but is also for the mutual building up of the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
