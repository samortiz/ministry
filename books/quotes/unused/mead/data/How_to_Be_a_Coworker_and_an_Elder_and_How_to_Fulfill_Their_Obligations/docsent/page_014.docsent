   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 In Death His Humanity Was Crucified</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His death Christ's humanity was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, His humanity was crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Peter 3:18 says, "Christ...on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we can see that when He died, it was His flesh that was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His divinity was not crucified; rather, it became very active.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not easy for the readers of the Bible to see that when Christ was on the cross, while His flesh was being put to death, His divinity was actively working.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 In Resurrection His Crucified Humanity Was Made Alive by the Spirit of His Divinity and Was Uplifted into the Sonship of the Only Begotten Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, in the resurrection of Christ, His crucified humanity was made alive by the Spirit of His divinity and was uplifted into the sonship of the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That death causes the shell of the grain to be broken and destroyed, yet at the same time, the life within the grain is made active.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The outward shell is broken and dies, but the life within is activated and begins to germinate and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This germination, this growth, is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Hymns, #482 the first two lines of stanza 1 say, "I am crucified with Christ,/And the cross hath set me free"; then the first two lines of stanza3 say, "This the secret nature hideth,/Harvest grows from buried grain."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a grain of wheat is buried in the ground, is it dying or living?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the grain of wheat were merely dying, no farmer would want to sow any grain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who sows knows that although a grain dies alone when it is sown, it brings forth thirty grains, sixty grains, and even a hundred grains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To bear much fruit is to be made alive, and this takes place at the time of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The grain of wheat, on the one hand, is dying, but on the other hand, is being made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true with Christ when He was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although His humanity, His flesh, as His outer shell, was crucified on the cross, the Spirit as the essence of His divinity was greatly activated so that His crucified humanity might be made alive in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only so, when His humanity was made alive, it was uplifted into the sonship of the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, as soon as He was resurrected, His humanity was uplifted into the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 Thus, He Was Begotten by God in His Resurrection to Be the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only begotten son is different from the firstborn son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "only begotten son" means that there is only one son, whereas the "firstborn son" means that there are at least two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who were begotten with Christ in His resurrection were not just two, but millions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 2:5 says that God "made us alive together with Christ," and verse 6 says that He "raised us up together with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We were enlivened by being made alive together with Christ and then we were resurrected together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He died on the cross, we also died with Him there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While He was dying on the cross, His Spirit of life was making Him alive and also making us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we were made alive with Him and were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His resurrection was His birth, in which He was begotten to be God's firstborn Son Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our resurrection was also our birth, in which we were born to be God's many sons 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is God's firstborn Son; we are God's many sons Rom 8:29 .</S>
