   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-SEVEN CONCERNING CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two aspects to the crucifixion of Christ: being crucified by man and being crucified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Which part of Christ's crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to human time, the crucifixion lasted for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the first three hours, the Lord spoke three sentences, and during the last three hours, He spoke four sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why did He not speak more or less during the first three hours?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read carefully, we realize that the first three hours of the crucifixion were the work of man, while the last three hours were the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the first three hours, lasting from nine in the morning until noon Mark 15:25 , man was mocking, scourging, reproaching, crucifying, and railing at the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All this was heaped upon Him by man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the last three hours, lasting from noon until three in the afternoon, the crucifixion was the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know this because from noon until three there was darkness over all the land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was definitely beyond man's capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The veil of the temple was also suddenly split in two from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was also beyond man's capability.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the earth was shaken, rocks were split, and even tombs were opened Matt 27:45, 51-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of these could not be the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were altogether the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the first part of the Lord Jesus' crucifixion on the cross, man did everything that he could do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the last part, God also did all that He could do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first part of the crucifixion expressed all the hatred of man toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last part revealed all the love of God toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, one might say that the cross is the meeting point of love and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now let us look at the three sentences spoken by the Lord during the first three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" Luke 23:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could God forgive those who murdered an innocent person?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How could the Lord even pray in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God answered this prayer, would He not become unrighteous?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to answer this, we must be clear that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to bear the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The righteous God could forgive our sins only by the cross because "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, only from His position on the cross could the Lord Jesus pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, the Lord Jesus' prayer as well as God's forgiveness would have been unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, He said, "Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could such a thief enter into Paradise?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If all the thieves were permitted to enter into Paradise, would it still be a Paradise?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These, however are only man's considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eyes of God, not only are thieves barred from Paradise, but even the so-called good people are unqualified to enter because, in Adam, all have sinned Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus was able to speak to the repentant thief in this way because He is the only Mediator between God and man 1 Tim 2:5 and because He is the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through the eternal Spirit, He offered Himself to God without spot or blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, His blood can purge man's conscience from dead works Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The thief in Paradise is no longer a thief, but one whose conscience has been purged from dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today all who receive Him, that is, all who believe in His name, will have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, He said, "Woman, behold, your son....Behold, your mother" John 19:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse shows us that because of the Lord's accomplishment on the cross, we have a new relationship with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have fellowship not only with God but also with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John was not the only one who could receive Mary as his mother according to the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, even Paul Rom 16:13 and all the saints throughout the ages also shared this kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How marvelous it is that by having the same life, a new relationship is produced among all the saints.</S>
