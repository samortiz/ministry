For example, 1 Corinthians 12:13 mentions being baptized into one Spirit. This Spirit is compared to water and therefore is not personified. This Spirit is subject to us (1 Cor. 14:32). However, the Spirit that dwells within us is personified, and we have to come under His subjection. The Spirit that is upon us submits to us, and we can direct Him to stay or go away. We also determine whether we want much or a little of Him. However, the Spirit that dwells within us is personified, and we have to submit ourselves to Him. In the eyes of God, the Spirit that is upon us is like an element. If we are not careful, Satan can come in and counterfeit it. Pentecostal people err in that they are taken over by the spirit that is upon them. This is why there is confusion among them. We cannot follow their way. We have to obey the Spirit who is within us, but we have to take control of the Spirit that is upon us. Whether at home or in the meetings, we have to learn to take control of the Spirit that is upon us in seeking for the outpouring.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF THE OUTPOURING<br />OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>There are two things we should know about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. First, if we have never passed the gate of victory, such an outpouring will not be of much help in our daily life. If a man has received the outpouring of the Spirit but has never passed the gate of victory, his experience of the Spirit will diminish after a few days. He will be like a punctured bicycle tire, and he will not be able to go very far. He will have to seek for the Spirit once again. Whenever he becomes cold, he has to seek the outpouring once more. This is the initial condition of outpouring in a man who has never passed the gate of victory.</p><p>After one has received the outpouring of the Spirit, he should immediately apply the power that accompanies the outpouring to help other Christians or to preach the gospel. Prior to this, he might have been powerless to preach the gospel or to help other believers. But after he has received the outpouring, he should immediately apply this power to the preaching of the gospel and the edification of the believers. If he does not apply this power, he will, in essence, be burying his one talent in the ground. As soon as a person has received the power of the Spirit, he has to preach the gospel and be an overcomer in the gospel. The failure of some of the Pentecostal people lies in the fact that they have made the outpouring of the Spirit into a kind of entertainment. After some receive the outpouring, they speak in tongues or laugh ecstatically. However, they then go home and do not apply any of the power they have received. This is like a man with a healthy body doing nothing but playing ball for eight hours a day. Such a life is not normal. The outpouring of the Spirit is not for our entertainment, but for us to live and work for the Lord.</p><p>Moreover, as soon as one receives the outpouring of the Spirit, he should immediately pray for the gifts. Suppose a person has never had the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit. When it happens, he should immediately ask God for the gifts also. He should ask God for whatever grace he desires to have. After a man has received the outpouring, he can even be a little greedy in what he asks from the Lord. Of course, one cannot make the outpouring a matter of boast, and he should not brag to others about it. Rather, he should allow God's grace and power to be manifested through him and His glory to shine through him.</p><h2 class="head1">TESTIFYING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>You should pay attention to a few things when testifying about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. First, if you have the experience of the outpouring and someone asks about it, you should not tell him the details of your experience. In testifying to others of your experience of the outpouring, you have to follow a few principles:</p><p>First, you should not discuss the details of your experience. In the New Testament, the book of Acts records many manifestations of the outpouring of the Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and being empowered for the gospel. But we are not told the details of these experiences. Those who received the outpouring only testified in a general way. They never said anything about the details. Pentecostals often go into great length about the details of their experience of the outpouring, and this often leads to confusion.</p><p>Second, you should not overemphasize the experiences. Many of those seeking for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are inquisitive. Someone else's experience of the outpouring will not help them at all. In telling others about your experience, it is easy for them to take your experience as the standard. In actuality, however, the manifestations of the outpouring are different in different people. This is why you must not overemphasize your own experiences.</p><p>There is another point worth noting: Pentecostal people receive the outpouring of the Spirit by "seeking," whereas we receive it by "believing." We believe that Jesus of Nazareth has been exalted by God to be both Lord and Christ. He has sat down on the throne, and He has poured out His Spirit. We believe and accept these facts. The outpouring of the Spirit is for the purpose of bearing witness to the exaltation of Jesus. It is not for the purpose of proving that God has heard our prayers or that He has accepted our plea. The outpouring of the Spirit is strictly linked to the exaltation of the Lord Jesus; it is not linked to our prayers or our good works. We have to uplift the Lord rather than ourselves. We have to give glory to Him rather than to ourselves. We have to boast in the Lord, rather than in ourselves.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
