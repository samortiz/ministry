The Standing and Angle of Daniel and John<br>in Receiving the Revelation<br>and in Seeing the Vision</H2><P>To see something we must have a proper standing and a proper angle. Many Christians read the Bible, but they do not receive any light or any vision. This is because their standing and angle are wrong. God's prophetic word is very particular. If we do not have the proper standing and angle, we will not see the vision. We need to have the standing and angle of Daniel and John in receiving the revelation and in seeing the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Daniel Being in Captivity in Babylon;<br>His Heart Being Fully on God and His People,<br>His Temple, and His Holy City for God's Kingdom on the Earth; and Being in His Spirit, Fully Occupied with Prayer and Supplications to God</H2><P>Daniel was in captivity in Babylon (Dan. 9:1-2a); his heart was fully on God and His people, His temple, and His holy city for God's kingdom on the earth (Dan. 9:2b-19); and he was in his spirit, fully occupied with prayer and supplications to God (Dan. 9:20-23). We may be interested in prophecy, but what is our heart occupied with? Is our heart like Daniel's? Our heart has to be fully on God and His desire in order for us to receive the revelation and see the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. John Being in Exile on the Island of Patmos; His Heart Being for the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus in Participating in the Tribulation, Kingdom, and Endurance in Jesus; and Being in His Spirit on the Lord's Day, Seeking after the Lord and Looking<br>to His Appearing</H2><P>John was in exile on the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9b); his heart was for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus in participating in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus (Rev. 1:9); and he was in his spirit on the Lord's day, seeking after the Lord and looking to His appearing (Rev. 1:10). Daniel and John were the same in their standing and angle, so they saw the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVENTY WEEKS UNVEILED TO DANIEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Seventy Weeks Being Apportioned Out for the People of Israel and for the Holy City, Jerusalem</H2><P>Seventy weeks were apportioned out for the people of Israel and for the holy city, Jerusalem (Dan. 9:24-27). At the time Daniel saw the vision of these seventy weeks, the country of Israel was lost into the hands of the Gentile nations. These nations were Babylon and then Medo-Persia. The holy city was destroyed, the holy temple was devastated, and they were in captivity for about seventy years. Daniel was in such a situation. Daniel had no heart to be there, but what could he do? He could not do anything except pray. He prayed again and again. Then a vision came to him. Something secret was unveiled to him&#151;the seventy weeks.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Prophecy of the Four 'Sevens' in the Bible &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
