   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we will consider the move of God in man in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Such a subject may not seem to be very organic, but the building up of the church as the Body of Christ is altogether an organic matter within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the building up of the Body of Christ, God moves intrinsically, not in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I was instructed that the term the Body of Christ was merely a metaphor signifying what the church is to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I accepted this teaching at that time, but gradually, after many years, I found out that the Body of Christ is not a metaphor; it is a great reality in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, our physical body is a metaphor portraying the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To know what the Body of Christ is, we must study our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have learned a great deal about the Body of Christ by studying my own body over a number of years and through a number of illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. IN CHRIST A. Christ Building Up His Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, God's move in the building up of the Body of Christ is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Matthew 16:15-18, it is Christ who builds up His church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 15 the Lord asked the disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 16 Peter responded by saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord then said to Peter, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This rock in verse 18 refers not only to Christ but also to the revelation concerning Christ that Peter received from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 18 Christ said clearly that He would build up His church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we should not forget that Christ is not separate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, Christ became the Builder of the church by being appointed, that is, commissioned, to do the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Christ of God, He was appointed and commissioned by God to be the Builder of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christ means "the anointed One."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointed One is the appointed One, and the appointed One is the commissioned One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ has been anointed, appointed, and commissioned by God to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So actually it is God who builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is the source of the building because God is the anointing One and the appointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the One who commissioned the Christ of God to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In one sense, Christ builds the church, but in another sense, He did not initiate this work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The initiation of the building up of the Body of Christ was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, God is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we can realize that to study the Bible is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my speaking in the past I stressed only the point of Christ building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in this message the stress is not the building of the church by Christ, but on the source, the initiation, of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The source and initiation of the building of the church is not Christ but God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God initiated this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God anointed His Son to carry out His commission to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the building of the church by Christ is actually God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1976 we built the meeting hall in Anaheim, California in about nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One brother was appointed to purchase all the materials, and another brother was appointed as a kind of superintendent to oversee the entire project.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All who worked on the building carried out the instructions of the superintendent without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was one of the main reasons that the work progressed so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, the brother who served as superintendent built the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was appointed and commissioned for this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But on the other hand, the person who commissioned this brother was the one who built the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, Christ has been commissioned by God to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ builds the church only according to the Father's will, according to the Father's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the building of the church is actually the move of God.</S>
