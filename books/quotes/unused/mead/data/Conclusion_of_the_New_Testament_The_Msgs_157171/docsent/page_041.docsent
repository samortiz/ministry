   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 49</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered certain aspects of this living that are found in 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall cover other aspects that are found in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>6 Being Members One of Another</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12:5 says, "We, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase "in Christ" is very significant, for it indicates the believers' organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase "in Christ" always implies the thought or the fact that we are organically one with Christ, that we have a life union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were born in Adam, but we have been transplanted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we have been organically united with Christ, we have been planted into Christ's Body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, in Christ, we have an organic union with the Body of Christ, and we are organic parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the organic union with Christ there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This life joins us not only to Christ but to all the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life that keeps us in an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we remain in this organic union, we are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we do not remain in this organic union, we are out of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The actuality of the Body is in or remaining in the organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would live in the Body, we must stay in the organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we must remain in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we stay in the organic union with Christ, the more in actuality we are living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body life is a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can realize this by considering our physical body, which is a corporate entity composed of many members, all of which have their life and function in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a member becomes separate or detached from the body, it loses its life and function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that no member of the body can be independent of the body or become individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle is the same with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of us as members of the Body is a complete entity; rather, each of us is a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need to remain in the Body for life and function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 12 reveals the importance of the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 5 reveals that we are members of one another in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We, being many, are one Body, one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Body we can function and express Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are many members, not many separate units.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As members, we need to coordinate with each other so that we may be a living, functioning Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not cooperate with each other, then we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be realized in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 12:5 Paul tells us that we are "severally members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word "severally" here does not mean separately; it means differently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This word indicates that we are different kinds of members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we are severally members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>7 By Presenting Their Bodies as a Living Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The believers live in the Body of Christ by presenting their bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Romans 12:1 Paul says, "I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to have the Body life, we need to have our body presented both to the Lord and to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should present our body to the Lord for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His salvation the Lord has released our body from the usurping hand of the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, in the organic union with Christ, we need to present our released body to the Lord for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Presenting our bodies to God is the practical side of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because our being exists in the body, we must present the body so that our whole being may be given over to God in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many believers have a heart to consecrate themselves, but because their physical body has not been offered, their consecration is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Real consecration means that our body has been presented; it is neither a mere desire nor a verbal yieldedness, but a giving of ourselves entirely and practically to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 12:1 Paul begs us to present our bodies a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 6:13 and 19 he encourages us to present the members of our body as weapons for fighting and as servants for serving because Romans 6 is a matter of warfare and service.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the Body life is a matter of sacrifice, a matter of offering ourselves to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Body life as a whole is an offering for the satisfaction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although many bodies are presented, the sacrifice is one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the many members are one Body and the many believers are one church, the many bodies presented to the Lord for the Body are one sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul says that this sacrifice is a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here Paul is comparing this sacrifice with the sacrifices of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The sacrifices offered in Old Testament days were all slain, but the Body life is not a slain offering; it is a living offering full of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 8 reveals that the believers should be filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now in Romans 12 the believers are encouraged to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God, as a living offering filled with the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, this sacrifice is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that the presenting of our bodies as a living sacrifice is separate from common things and possesses God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is holy, absolutely different and separate from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's holy nature has been wrought into the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, the Body also is holy and unique.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nothing common can be brought into it.</S>
