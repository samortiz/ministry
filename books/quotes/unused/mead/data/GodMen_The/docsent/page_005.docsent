   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Having the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As those who are born of God, the God-men have not only the divine life but also the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank God that in the Bible, among the sixty-six books, there is one verse, 2 Peter 1:4, that says that we are partakers of the divine nature, which is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should mark such a verse in our Bibles so that whenever we open the Bible, that verse will stand out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not turtles, because we do not have the turtle nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are men, for we do have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we have also been born of God; we are God's sons, God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we have God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we have God's nature, are we not God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, we are God in His life and His nature, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>D. Having Two Lives, Human and Divine, Living Together as One Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As God-men, we also have two lives, human and divine, living together as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may wonder how two lives could live together as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The answer is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In grafting, a branch from one tree is grafted into another tree.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two are joined together, and the two lives live together as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, we, the believers, have been grafted into Christ Rom 11:17-19 and are living in an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In such a union the human life and the divine life are joined as one so that they live together as one mingled life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>E. Having Two Natures, Humanity and Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The God-men not only have two lives, but they also have two natures, humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today's Christianity makes God's salvation merely a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Religion does not teach people to be God-men by receiving God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Religion always cultivates man's natural capacity in order to build up the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Education does the same thing; it merely builds up the human being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apparently, the Bible also does this, but actually it does not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible does not build up the natural man; rather, it builds up a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are born of God, and we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible builds us up to be proper God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My burden in the Lord's ministry is not to build you up to be a nice man, a good man, or a gentle man, but to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have given thousands of messages on how to be a Christ-man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Lord's recovery our teaching is not to raise up good men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our teaching, absolutely according to the Bible, is to raise up God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, the Bible builds up a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ultimately, this corporate man will be enlarged to be its consummation, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The issue of the Bible's teaching is just one entity, the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of all the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to know by seeing that we have God's life and possess God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is such a fact that the divine life is mingled with our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must learn how to live not by our human life but by God's life mingling with our human life to make us divine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>F. The Human Life the Old Man Being Crucified for the Living of the Divine Life with the Resurrected Human Life the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our human life the old man has been crucified for the living of the divine life with the resurrected human life the new man Gal 2:20a; Eph 4:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our old man, the natural man, should not be cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, it should be cut off; it should be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has been crucified already with Christ on the cross Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has crucified all His believers so that His believers may live not by the crucified life but by the divine life in a humanity that is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now the divine life is living not in the natural humanity but in the resurrected humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to see such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because I have seen this, I always hate my own humility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hate my humility much more than my pride, because both my pride and my humility belong to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should always be reminded that our old man was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then, in regeneration our natural humanity was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regeneration is a resurrection cf.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be regenerated is to be resurrected with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, today we should live a life conformed to the death of Christ Phil 3:10 that the divine life may have an opportunity to live with our resurrected humanity.</S>
