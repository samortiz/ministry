   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everyone Being Revived</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the small groups are established, the brothers and sisters have to start meeting in the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing to do in the small group meeting is to see whether or not everyone is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This revival is a morning-by-morning revival, a day-by-day overcoming, a life that lives Christ, that speaks Christ, and that attends every meeting there is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The revival that we talk about in the Lord s recovery is easier than all the revivals that Christians have sought after throughout the previous centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All we need to do is go to the Lord every morning when we wake up and pour out everything we have in us in a genuine way from the depth of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way, we will be cleansed and will be enlightened by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord will fill us, and we will be able to consecrate ourselves to Him to live the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After ten minutes, our whole being will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following that, we should move on with the sun, which means to walk according to the Lord Jesus who is rising up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the end, we will become like the sun, just as the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In at least three places the Bible compares those who love the Lord and follow Him to the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Proverbs 4:18 says, But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Judges 5:31 also says, But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 13:43 says, Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, every morning we need to have a new beginning before the Lord to be revived anew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this, we all have to make a vow to the Lord and to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only then can we be living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to walk the new way, we must be the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new man is the living man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The old man will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The oldness I am talking about is not oldness in age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some have said that Brother Lee does not want old folks anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a total misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I never reject those that are old in age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am only rejecting the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The old man cannot take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the first thing to make clear in the small groups is that everyone has to be revived and have clear dealings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone has to consecrate himself honestly to the Lord and live for Him, that God s New Testament economy may be realized in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only by this can we walk the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new way requires a revived and living people to walk in it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Preaching the Gospel to Gain New Ones</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second thing the small group has to do is consider whether or not there are new ones among them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If not, the small group meeting cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where do the new ones come from?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only way to gain new ones is by preaching the gospel through visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Three persons will be grouped into a team and will go out to preach the gospel by knocking at others doors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There can be two to three teams in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every week they should go out at least twice, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After doing this consecutively for a few weeks, surely a few new ones will be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Next, they should distribute the new ones among them, and the saints in the small group should start caring for them specifically one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that every one will have at least two new ones in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Preferably, each should have three to care for.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the base number for a small group meeting is twelve, with eight to nine being the regularly active ones, they can care for at least eighteen new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nourishing and Leading the New Ones</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we baptize the new ones, we should begin having home meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the beginning, if possible, we should go to nourish them once every two to three days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a month, we can visit them once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we go to the home meetings, we have to lead the new ones to attend the small group meetings and the Lord s Day district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, within a week after a person is saved, we should work into him all four things: the begetting, the nourishing, the teaching, and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we should continue to do this every week.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, among the new ones, there are better ones and worse ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their condition also varies from time to time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as the number you care for becomes less than two or three, you should look for others to go with you to preach the gospel by knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will replenish the number of new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we would all do this, the number will surely increase.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A small group that originally has twelve people will bring in over ten new ones after six months, and those twenty or more people will be established in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By then, we can divide this small group of twenty or more people into two small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as the small group is divided, we repeat the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Begin by considering whether or not everyone is consecrated and whether or not everyone is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors and gain some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, care for and help the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there is a shortage, replenish the number immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, after another half year, we can divide again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Originally there was only one group.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After half a year, it becomes two.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By the end of the year, it becomes four groups.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the four groups, there are at least forty people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way we have a two and one-half times increase.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you will all practice this way, you will find that such a result is not that hard to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if we take a big discount, we may still have, with a base number of twelve at the beginning of the year, an addition of fourteen by the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In all we will have twenty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is surely attainable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Why were we not able to do such a thing in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is because we did not have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There were too many blueprints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everyone was wasting his time on useless ways.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now I am presenting before you this way of building according to plan.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I hope that you will all build according to this plan and will practice these three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are the three phases of the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Number one is the morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Number two is the gaining of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Number three is nourishing and helping the new ones to have home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings.</S>
