<h2 class="head1">VICTORY BEING CHRIST LIVING IN US</h2><p>Victory is the Lord Jesus living in us. Because the Lord lives in us, He overcomes for us. No temptation is so great that He cannot overcome it. God has not given us Christ to be our example. He has given us Christ to be our life. Four years ago I was in New York, and I met a Presbyterian medical doctor with his wife and four children. The wife was about forty years old, and she was very humble. She came to me and said, "You have to pray for me. Pray that God would give me patience. My four children are driving me crazy. I can tolerate one being rowdy, and I can tolerate two being rowdy. But when three start to become rowdy, my temper begins to flare up. If all four become rowdy, I completely lose control of my temper." I asked, "What do you lack?" She said, "Patience, of course!" I then asked, "Has the Lord ever answered your prayer for patience?" She said, "No." I then said to her, "The Lord has not answered this kind of prayer before, and He will not answer this kind of prayer in the future. You cannot be patient, and you will not be patient. What you lack is not patience." She said, "What do you mean? If I do not lack patience, what do I lack?" I said, "What you lack is Christ, not patience, meekness, or quietness." Patience is Christ. True humility, meekness, and holiness are just Christ.</p><p>A brother said to me in Shanghai, "I cannot be patient. What do I have to do before I can have patience?" I told him that there is a toothbrush factory in Shanghai that sells toothbrushes wholesale; it does not sell toothbrushes retail. This is what our God does&mdash;He is in the wholesale business; He does not care for retail business. If you want a little patience from Him, He will not give it to you. He has put all virtues in Christ. When you believe and receive Him, Christ becomes yours, and all the virtues also become yours. First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has given Christ to us to be our sanctification. I cannot be sanctified in myself; rather, Christ is my sanctification in me and for me. You may not realize how precious this substitution is. God has given Christ to us to be our sanctification. He is living out a life of sanctification within us and for us. If anyone sees this tonight, I will shake his hand and congratulate him; he is the most blessed man on earth. If you are living by yourself, you cannot be sanctified. But if Christ is living in you, you can make it. This is the victory that God has given us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">An Exchange, Not a Change</h2><p>Let us consider the characteristics of the overcoming life. First, we must see that the overcoming life is an exchanged life, not a changed life. Victory is not a matter of being changed; it is a matter of being exchanged. We all want to be changed, but God wants to show us that we cannot be changed for the better. God has lost hope in us completely. He knows that we can never be changed for the better. The Foochow dialect has a colloquial expression Shi-wu-bien, meaning no change until death. A person who is Shi-wu-bien is one who can never change, even until his death. Thank the Lord. He has shown us that our life is not changed; it is exchanged.</p><p>Once when I was in Shanghai, I bought a watch. At the time I bought it, the shopkeeper gave me a warranty that guaranteed that he would fix the watch free of charge if it broke down within two years. The second morning after I bought the watch, I noticed that it was two and a half hours off. I took the watch to the shop and said to the man, "Why is the watch off by two and a half hours?" The man said, "Okay, okay, I will fix it for you." After two days I went back to pick up my watch. After using it for another day, it was off by an hour again. I took it back for repair a second time. After it was repaired, I took it home. The next day the time was the same as it had been the night before; it had not even moved. I took it back again and asked the man to find why it was not moving. The man said, "Okay, okay, you do not have to say anything more. We will fix it for you." After another week I took the watch home. The next day the watch was three hours fast. I went to the shop again and said to the man, "I have owned this watch for only twenty days. Of these twenty days, it has been in your shop for fourteen days and with me for only six days. Is this your watch or is it mine? Since you cannot fix it, could you exchange it for another one?" But the man said, "There is no such thing as an exchange. The warranty only guarantees repair work. If it breaks down again, you can bring it in and we will fix it for you, until the two year period expires."</p><p>Do you see what I mean? Repairing and exchanging are two different things. Repairing involves making good that which is broken, whereas exchanging involves getting rid of that which is old and replacing it with something new. Man's concept is to repair, but God's salvation is to exchange. Most people pray for God to give them power to change for the better. But this is like fixing my terrible watch; no matter how much one repairs it, it will never be changed for the better. The only way is to exchange it for a new one. God's salvation does not help us change for the better; it does not help us to overcome. God's salvation is Christ overcoming for us. God never does a work of changing us; rather, He exchanges our life.</p><p>A year or two ago, I was in Chefoo. In a conference that was prepared specifically for Westerners, the subject of victory was brought up. A Westerner asked, "How can our lives be changed?" I answered, "Victory is not a matter of changing our life. Victory is an exchange of life. It is not a changed life, but an exchanged life. Man is concerned only with changing himself. But in God's eyes, man is too deceitful and evil. There is no way for him to be changed. Adam cannot be changed into a son of God, and tares cannot be changed into wheat. Instead, Adam is exchanged for the Son of God, and tares are exchanged for wheat. Today God has crucified our old man through the Lord's cross. Christ is living within us and is overcoming for us. Our life has been exchanged; it is not merely changed."</p>
