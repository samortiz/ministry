   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN TWO TREES, TWO PRINCIPLES,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TWO RESULTS TALKS 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Morning, January 9, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee WHAT GOD WANTS BEING WORKS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words of Confucius and Mencius are different from the words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not trying to make the cold brothers and sisters excited and the disorderly ones orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not doing a mortician's job here, improving men's outward appearance a little and eventually burying them in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to ask what kind of work we are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are merely putting some cosmetics on dead people, adding some plaster to thin cheeks and some color to pale faces, we are doing a work of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What God wants is a work of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we compare Genesis 1 and 2 with the last two chapters of Revelation, we will discover that at the end of Revelation there is no longer the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil eventually ends in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is the constituent of death, whereas God is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the ages, God has been showing us one thing, which is that everything that has to do with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil eventually ends in death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RIVER OF WATER AND THE RIVER OF FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible talks about the river of water and the river of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Daniel 7:10 mentions the stream of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, fire comes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 3 mentions the flaming sword.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we touch the tree of life, there is the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the tree of life appeared, the river of life was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This river produced gold, bdellium, and onyx stone Gen 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gold signifies God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once this gold passes through you, you will be "plated" with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The bdellium is pearl, which is produced from a grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the sand gets into an oyster, the secretion of the oyster produces the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, when we believe in the Lord, we enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that day on, God's nature is continually dispensed into us to turn us into pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This pearl in the end becomes the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 4 also mentions the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Precious stones refer to God's manifested glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Jerusalem was constituted with gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There the river refers to the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jeremiah 17:7 and 8 say that those who trust in the Lord are like a tree planted by the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jeremiah 2:13 also says that when we forsake God, we are forsaking the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 46:4 says that there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psalm 36:7 and 8 say that God makes us to drink of the river of His pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, we eat the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, we drink of the river of His pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the footnote in Darby's Bible, the word pleasures here is of the same root as the word for Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezekiel 47 also mentions the river.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This river is the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The river of fire signifies God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This river begins from the flaming sword in Genesis 3, and it flows all the way to the lake of fire at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lake of fire is the culmination of all the rivers of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When all the rivers of fire flow together, they become a lake.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TWO PRINCIPLES OF LIVING AND TWO RESULTS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our burden is to show the brothers and sisters that to touch the tree of life is to touch God, and that to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to touch fire and death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, in order to learn to serve God and to work for Him, a Christian must learn to stay away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose a brother or a sister is very meek, submissive to his or her parents, and full of all kinds of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Outwardly speaking, these are very good things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, they are all things that belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, we do not want to see people fighting, sinning, or falling into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But neither do we like to see people remaining in the good of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, a couple may be arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our natural concept is to exhort them to be reconciled with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if we know the principle of the tree of life, we will not exhort them to be patient or humble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are clear about the principle of the tree of life, we will lead this couple into life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who touch the tree of life will see their life and work remaining in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who are sinful will go into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who are moral will also go into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today, we are not saying that we do not need love or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Within the tree of life, there is surely love and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the love and humility that issue from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will result in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only the virtues that issue from the tree of life will last unto eternity.</S>
