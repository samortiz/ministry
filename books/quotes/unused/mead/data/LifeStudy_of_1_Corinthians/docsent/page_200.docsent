   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT DEALING WITH THE MATTER OF RESURRECTION 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45-58</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the definition of resurrection and then go on to see the victory of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>B. A Spiritual Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>with Christ s Heavenly Image</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 45 says, So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, in incarnation, He became flesh for redemption John 1:14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had a soulish body like Adam through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has a spiritual body through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, we become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually our present soulish body will also become a spiritual body in resurrection just as His body is vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>52-54; Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 45 implies both creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Adam, the first man, was the head of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God created him, Adam became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that he became a person, a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Hebrew the word for Adam means man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because God created Adam a living soul, his main part was the soul, which is for the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, in principle, if we live in our soul, by our soul, or for our soul, we are in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The soul is the center and lifeline of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person may be moral, but if he lives in the soul, he still belongs to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ being the last Adam implies a termination and conclusion of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The old creation ends with a man, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Man who terminated the old creation became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now this Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The old creation was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new creation, however, comes into being not by creation, but by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, verse 45 implies two creations: the old creation with man as a living soul to be the center and lifeline, and the new creation in resurrection with the life-giving Spirit as the center and lifeline.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christians today are short of revelation, of the proper spiritual vision, and oppose us when we say that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But to deny that Christ is the life-giving Spirit is equal to denying the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life-giving Spirit is the life pulse of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and did not become a life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would not mean nearly as much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It could then be compared to the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce, bring forth, anything related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Christ s resurrection is absolutely a matter related to life, for in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most Christians believe in resurrection simply in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To them the resurrection of Christ is nothing more than an objective act, an act which is not related to the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have this understanding of Christ s resurrection also regard His ascension strictly in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They do not realize that the ascension has something to do with us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the point of view of some Christians, both the resurrection and ascension of Christ have nothing to do with us as far as life is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, both are objective facts accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They hold to these facts as part of their fundamental beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is very much related to us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through incarnation Christ became a man; He became us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, incarnation was much more than an objective fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a process that brought God into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The principle is the same with the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Resurrection was not merely an act in itself; it was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through the process of resurrection, the Man who ended the old creation became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Very few Christians have seen that Christ in resurrection is a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Andrew Murray, however, understood something concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He wrote about it in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled, The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is actually the Lord Jesus Himself in resurrection and in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Traditional Christian theology opposes the truth that Christ has become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the opinion of many, this is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Actually, it is a truth found in the depths of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eventually, the truth will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Corinthians 15:45 is a great verse.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To repeat, this verse implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This Spirit is nothing less than Christ, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have become the new creation germinated by the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In The Economy of God we emphasize the human spirit and Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The highest definition of resurrection is that it is the process by which Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 1964, when we were working on our hymnal, one brother advised us not to publish the hymns on Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He admitted that the Bible reveals that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, he said that because most Christians would not accept this teaching, we should not include hymns on this matter in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I told him that I would never force anyone to follow my teaching, but that I did need the liberty to teach the truth from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I went on to point out that our goal is first to save sinners by preaching the gospel; second, to edify the saints and build them up through proper teaching so that they may grow in life; third, to take the unique ground of the church to establish local churches; and fourth, to have the fellowship of all the churches as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I said that as long as our work has these four aspects, we have the same aim and the same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I also told him that I have a heavy burden concerning the matter of Christ being the Spirit and that I have no choice except to minister according to this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I told him that I must declare that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not up to me whether others will accept this teaching or reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At the time of Martin Luther, not everyone accepted the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If Luther had been hesitant on this point, how could there have been a Reformation?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I told him strongly that I am not afraid of opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I do not want anyone to follow me blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Paul says, Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If I follow Christ, if I follow the Bible, if I follow the truth, then you should follow me.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Likewise, if you follow Christ, the Bible, and the truth, I should follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this manner, we should follow one another.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is what we endeavor to do in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Some who oppose the claim that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit try to make an issue of the fact that 15:45 does not use a definite article, that this verse speaks of a life-giving Spirit and not of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, the crucial matter here is not whether the article is definite or indefinite; it is the clear mentioning of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do our opposers believe that there are two Spirits who give life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is heretical to teach that there are two life-giving Spirits, two Spirits who give life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more I speak on Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, the more bold, assured, and encouraged I am.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It truly is according to the divine revelation that Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>To say that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit is similar to saying, according to John 1:14, that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Notice that there is no article before the word flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Would it make any difference if this verse said, The Word became the flesh ?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In either case, flesh or the flesh, the meaning is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the same principle, the lack of the definite article is not crucial in 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>To repeat, the vital matter is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Christians may admit that certain matters are found in the Word, but, being afraid of man, they may not have the boldness to stand for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because of the influence of tradition, they do not stand fully for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Certain ones who oppose us have admitted that the Son is called the Father in Isaiah 9:6, but they would not say this because of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Others may follow tradition, but we care only for the Bible, the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In verse 46 Paul says, But the spiritual is not first, but the soulish; after that the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The spiritual here denotes Christ, the second Man; the soulish denotes Adam, the first man v. 47 . According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This was the reason that Paul deliberately says in this verse that the soulish and not the spiritual is the first.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The spiritual is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we take the way of the Bible, we should follow the second and not the first.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>For example, should you follow Cain or Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We certainly should not follow Cain, the first; we should follow Abel, the second.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Furthermore, at the time of the Passover, it was the firstborn who were slain.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This indicates that God s judgment is upon the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The same principle applies to the first creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>God does not want what is first; He wants what is second.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In verse 47 Paul continues, The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Out of the earth denotes the first man Adam s origin, and earthy denotes his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Christ is not only the last Adam, but also the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The first Adam is the beginning of mankind; the last Adam is the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>As the second Man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>In the entire universe there are these two men: the first man Adam, including all his descendants, and the second Man, Christ, comprising all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We believers were included in the first man by birth and became part of the second Man by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>As a part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>As part of the second Man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Out of heaven denotes both the second Man Christ s divine origin and His heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Verse 48 says, As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The earthy refers to the first man Adam, who is earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>They that are earthy denote all of Adam s descendants, who, like Adam, are earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The heavenly denotes the second Man Christ, who is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Likewise, they also that are heavenly denote all the believers in Christ, who, like Christ, are also heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Once we were earthy, but now we are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>In verse 49 Paul declares, And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>As a part of Adam, we have borne the earthy man s image through birth.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>As a part of Christ, we shall bear the heavenly Man s image in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>This indicates that just as we have been born in Adam as the earthy man, so we shall also be resurrected in Christ as the heavenly Man.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Such a resurrection is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>It is as sure as our birth and should never be questioned.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Today we are bearing two images, the image of the earthy and the image of the heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We may take as an illustration of our situation a caterpillar that is in the process of becoming a beautiful butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Sometimes the caterpillar in us can be seen; at other times the butterfly is somewhat evident.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Eventually, by resurrection, we shall fully emerge from the cocoon as butterflies.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>No longer shall we be ugly caterpillars we shall be beautiful butterflies bearing Christ s image.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>According to Philippians 3:21, the body of our humiliation will be transfigured into a body of glory and be like Christ s body.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This will take place by resurrection and in resurrection.</S>
