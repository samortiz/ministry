   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN HOW TO USE THE SPIRITUAL PUBLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HOW TO TEACH TRUTH LESSONS THE PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will continue to fellowship about the practice of the home meetings and the teaching of Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of the last few meetings, we have seen some results.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers are very faithful in putting into practice what they have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In their practice they have found some secrets and have made some improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that we will make much advancement in the coming days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I received a very encouraging report.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we divided the small groups into the home meetings, in three weeks our attendance increased by fifty percent, from three thousand to four thousand five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those attending the truth classes have increased by twenty percent to the current number of three thousand five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proves that the new way is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE NEED TO CARRY OUT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND THE HOME MEETINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need both the small group meetings and the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not stop the small group meetings because we now have the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot have home meetings without having small group meetings, that is, meetings that combine two or three families together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, we need to encourage the brothers and sisters to open up their homes for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, we need to encourage them to have spontaneous small group meetings in their neighborhood with a few other families.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not need to meet every week; they can meet once every two weeks for fellowship, encouragement, nourishment, mutual help, and inciting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The home meetings and the small group meetings must go together, like the two feet of the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The foundation, however, rests mainly in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We look to the Lord to bring the church on in its practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as a person is saved, the first thing we should do is open up his home and have meetings in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, we bring people to salvation through the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, such saved ones, being saved in their homes, will spontaneously have a good impression of and a strong inclination for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is one advantage of saving people in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is different from the way that we brought people to salvation through the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who were saved in the big meetings did not have a good impression of or a strong inclination for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as a person is open, even if he is not yet saved, we can bring a meeting to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BRINGING THE MEETINGS TO THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result of bringing meetings to people s homes is considerable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have story after story to confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some dormant ones were revived through the saints bringing the meetings to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many relatives have refused the gospel for many years, but as soon as the meetings go to their homes, they believe, receive the Lord, and are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It proves that the Lord s leading and what we have seen are right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as we contact someone, we should bring the meetings to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The minute he is saved, he should immediately open up his home.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He can do this because he was brought to the Lord through the way of bringing a meeting to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Lord s recovery, this practice should be the fundamental factor in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mormonism is a great heresy in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It tells people that the Lord Jesus was born of a marriage between Mary and Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although Mormonism accepts the Bible, it has its own Book of Mormon in addition to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today in America, Mormanism enjoys a strong increase.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Its influence worldwide is also quite phenomenal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Recently in Taiwan, I studied this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was very surprised by the results of my investigation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Mormon publications clearly state that its church is built up by the efforts of its members in opening up their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Its practice is the same as what the Lord has impressed us with and commissioned us to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be sure, we did not pick up anything from them, nor did they learn their practice from us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the very beginning, they have been teaching their members to build up their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1973 alone, they increased by one million members.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Mormons now have a presence in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although they have not been in Taiwan for a long time, they are very aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When some of our brothers and sisters visit the homes of new ones, they meet Mormons in the new ones homes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I feel that Satan is working here, because he knows that the Lord is carrying out the new way in Taiwan during these few years, and he is trying his best to frustrate the Lord s move with his counterfeit move.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>USING THE LORD S WORD TO TEACH</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>ONE ANOTHER IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has shown us that every saint should meet in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are now practicing this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At this point in time, we need to pay attention to the use of the Lord s word in a proper way in the home meetings to nourish and lead everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not ask the saints merely to open their homes, sing a few songs, pray and fellowship a little, have a snack, and then send everyone home.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should help them to realize that all the attendants should learn to teach one another in a mutual way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In a home meeting, the son in the family can call a hymn, the daughter can lead the prayer, and the mother can begin the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone can be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the home meetings we should teach one another in a mutual way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First, we should teach the children, the family members.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Next, they in turn should teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Of course, we must remember that we should not teach with our own teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, we should teach with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A person will receive help in the home meetings only through the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord s word is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For this reason, every time we have a home meeting, we should render the saints some words of the truth.</S>
