[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE GOSPEL BEING A BATTLE Scripture Reading: Matt 12:29; Eph 6:11-20; Phil 1:27 THE KIND OF PERSON WHO PREACHES THE GOSPEL
[2]  The gospel is preached not merely with words but mainly through persons.
[3]  In the book of Acts, when the church preached the gospel for the first time on the day of Pentecost, the words spoken were secondary, whereas the persons who spoke were primary.
[4]  If we would meet God s need today, we need to see that God s preaching of the gospel through His people on the earth is a matter of engaging in spiritual warfare.
[5]  We also need to see that toward God the preaching of the gospel is the outflow of life.
[6]  The gospel is the flowing out of the life of Christ from within us.
[7]  It is the overflowing of God s life for the purpose of bearing spiritual fruit.
[8]  If we would be those with the overflow of God s life in order to bear fruit, we need to go to the Lord to have proper dealings with Him and a renewed consecration before Him.
[9]  This shows that after consecrating ourselves anew to God, we need to come before God to be enlightened by Him so that we can see where we have made mistakes and are defiled and where we need to deny the self and have deeper dealings in order to be cleansed.
[10]  Whether we feel that we have been filled by the Holy Spirit or not, we need to believe that if we are consecrated persons who have received God s shining and cleansing and have allowed the Lord to gain us item by item, God s burning fire will burn us and purify us.
[11]  Whenever there is a gospel meeting, all the saints should pay more attention to prayer and should intensify their prayers.
[12]  In addition to strengthening our prayers, we all need to have a turn in our concept concerning the gospel meeting.
[13]  In traditional Christianity every time there is a revival meeting or an evangelical meeting, the success or failure of every activity, including the meeting, depends on the preacher, the one who serves as the mouthpiece.
[14]  However, we need to see that in our gospel meetings, we do not and should not have only one person who evangelizes or conducts some kind of meeting.
[15]  Therefore, we need to see that if the church s preaching of the gospel today is to be full of spiritual weight and is to have authority over people for the accomplishing of God s desire, we must have a spiritual base as strong as the one that the disciples had on the day of Pentecost.
[16]  Our work of the gospel is to receive the Lord Jesus as our burden from God, to be filled with Him, and to bear Him in our spirit and discharge Him to others so that we can impart Him into them.
[17]  ALL THAT CHRIST IS, ALL THAT HE HAS DONE,
[18]  According to the record in Acts 2, on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty disciples had no thought of giving a message or preaching the gospel.
[19]  The disciples knew of the Lord s incarnation, for they were with Him for three and a half years of His human life on the earth, and they saw how the Lord Jesus died on the cross.
[20]  They were filled with His incarnation as God who became flesh, with His living as a man on earth, with His death on the cross, with His burial and resurrection from the dead, with His manifesting Himself to them after His resurrection and His breathing into them the Holy Spirit, with His ascension into heaven before their eyes, and with the angels speaking to them concerning His return.
[21]  On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up with the eleven and began to speak, he was very bold Acts 2:14 .
[22]  Later, he went to the temple, healed a lame man, and took the opportunity afforded by the healing to speak a strong word to many in the temple 3:1-26 .
[23]  He said, You denied the holy and righteous One...whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses vv.
[24]  We need the Lord s mercy to see that the preaching of the gospel on the day of Pentecost was not a result of man s stirring up and enthusiasm but of God s gaining a group of people as His testimony.
[25]  This group of people had dealt with the problem of sins before God.
[26]  Instead of caring first for the salvation of others, including our relatives and friends, we should go to the Lord first to have dealings concerning sins, the entanglement and usurpation of the world, our living in the Lord s resurrection and ascension, and our living before God and in God.
[27]  May the Lord speak to all of us so that, on the one hand, our outward enthusiasm and excitement can be reduced, but on the other hand, the fire in our spirit will be actively kindled so that we can deal with sins and the world, with our living in the Lord s resurrection and ascension, and with our living before God and in God.
[28]  When they meet their friends, relatives, schoolmates, and colleagues, they may mention the church s gospel campaign as a topic of conversation and may invite people to come to the gospel meetings.
[29]  Whenever the Holy Spirit has led a person to sense his need for God and feel the heaviness of sins, the emptiness of life, and the longing for a Savior, we need to cooperate with the work of the Spirit by denying our natural excitement and by speaking in the spirit by faith a few sentences that can touch the person s inner being.
[30]  PREPARATION FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL Being a Person Who Is Consecrated and
[31]  In order to preach the gospel, we must be persons who are consecrated to the Lord and who are filled with Him.
[32]  However, if we are to be filled with Christ, we need to give Him the ground to be the Lord in our being.
[33]  If we cannot say that Jesus is Lord in the universe and that He is Lord within us, we will have little demonstration of the power of the gospel.
[34]  Fourth, when we preach the gospel, we need to avoid debating with people.
[35]  If someone has doubts about Jesus Christ, we do not need to argue about how good Jesus is.
[36]  Although people may speak many words contrary to what we have said, we simply need to give a testimony concerning ourselves in plain and simple words, presenting to them our condition before we were saved and the change we experienced after we believed in the Lord.
[37]  Everyone who participates in preaching the gospel should ask the Lord for timely utterance, that is, instant words to speak according to the need.
[38]  Whether we are giving a message or participating in other activities, such as inviting gospel friends to the meeting, ushering them to their seats, speaking to them after the meeting, writing down their names, or praying with them, we should learn to ask God for instant utterance.
[39]  Too often we have repeated the same thing in our preaching of the gospel: There is one God in the universe.
[40]  Although the people we speak to may not have a full understanding of doctrines such as God s creation, Jesus as the Savior, and man s fallen condition, we can ask the Lord to make known to us their inward condition and give us living words that speak to their condition.
[41]  When we preach the gospel, we need to have faith, because we are speaking God s words, and God s words will never return to Him vainly Isa 55:10-11 .
[42]  In this chapter and the five subsequent chapters we will consider God s salvation from various perspectives.
[43]  I hope that the words in these chapters will help those who have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus to make the best choice, that is, to receive the dynamic salvation of the Lord and thus obtain satisfaction in their human life.
[44]  The Bible says concerning salvation that the gospel of God is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes Rom 1:16 .
[45]  This salvation not only saves people out of death into life John 5:24 but also becomes everything to man so that man may receive God s many blessings Gal 3:14; Eph 1:3 .
[46]  Christians have the motivating power and willingness to preach the Lord Jesus as the gospel to others because they have Him as the center of their being.
[47]  Today it does not matter what time it is or where we are, nor does it matter who we are; as long as we are willing to open our heart and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we will receive God as our Savior and our life, and immediately there will be a change in our heart v. 21; Ezek 36:26-27 . Initially, we might have been full of darkness, but after receiving the Lord, we will be light in Him Eph 5:8 . We might have been weak, wavering, and in turmoil within, but after receiving the Lord, we will be full of peace and strength and will be unwavering and secure Col 3:15 . Once we receive the Lord Jesus, we will have a center and a power that calms us.
[48]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SINS OF HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: John 8:34, 36, 24 HUMAN LIFE BEING FULL OF SIN
[49]  In addition to the problem of emptiness, there is the problem of sin.
[50]  To obtain true freedom is to be delivered from sin vv.
[51]  God is good, and without Him there is no goodness Mark 10:18; Luke 18:19 .
[52]  CHAPTER SIX THE LIFE OF MAN Scripture Reading: John 3:3; 10:10b; 1 John 5:12 ALL THINGS CONCERNING MAN
[53]  In this chapter we will continue to consider man s problems.
[54]  If a man loses his life, everything concerning him will come to an end. All things concerning man, including his career and all his enjoyment, depend on man s life.
[55]  The fallen human life is not only evil, improper, and dishonest but also frail and mortal.
[56]  A person who is physically strong may lose his life when he is hit by a car, a person who is psychologically healthy can easily become angry or irrational when he is irritated, and people with a relatively high moral standard can stumble and fall when they encounter certain temptations.
[57]  I told this lady that losing or not losing our temper is not a matter of self-cultivation but a matter of life.
[58]  She was puzzled by my words and wondered how man could have his life changed.
[59]  I told her that our concept is to correct our behavior, but God s approach and the way of God s salvation is to change our life.
[60]  This is the way of God s salvation Rom 11:17 , that is, to graft sinners, the branches of a wild olive tree, into Christ, God s cultivated olive tree, so that they may partake of Christ s riches and thus bear sweet fruit to express the riches of God in Christ.
[61]  On His side, Jesus too was cut when He died on the cross to bear man s sins, to terminate man s sinful life, and to release God s divine life from within Him 1 Pet 2:24; Rom 6:6; John 19:34 .
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE DESTINATION OF HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Luke 15:1-24; 2 Cor 4:5
[63]  In addition to the problems of emptiness, sin, and man s life, the human life also has the problem of its destination.
[64]  The human life needs to have a destination a home to return to and a person to whom it should return.
[65]  Jesus is our Lord and the destination of our human life.
[66]  He came to be our Savior because He is our Master.
[67]  The Bible tells us that He is our Shepherd and that we are His lost sheep Gen 48:15; Psa 23:1; Isa 53:6; Mark 6:33-34; John 10:14-16 .
[68]  However, He was able to declare before many people that He and God were one John 10:30; 17:22 , that when they saw Him, they saw God 14:9 , and that when they believed into Him, they believed into God v. 1 . He was not speaking wild or boastful words, nor was He telling lies.
[69]  SALVATION FOR MAN 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:16; 1 Pet 2:24; Gal 2:20 THREE STEPS OF GOD S WONDERFUL WAY
[70]  First Timothy 3:16 says, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He God who was manifested in the flesh.
[71]  God being manifested in the flesh, the Lord Jesus bearing our sins, and Christ living in us these three matters fully reveal the three steps of God s way of salvation to man.
[72]  Due to mankind s need of salvation, many wise men and philosophers have tried to invent different ways of salvation to meet man s various needs.
[73]  Some of these ways are intended to meet the needs in man s behavior.
[74]  Self-cultivation cannot solve the inherent problem of man s behavior, buffeting oneself cannot solve the basic problem of man s corrupted nature, accomplishments in man s career and material enjoyment do not remove the sense of emptiness that comes from man s ignorance of the meaning of his human life, and doing good deeds and developing virtues cannot atone for one s wrongdoings in the past.
[75]  God came to accomplish salvation for man because He loves man.
[76]  Being Joined to Man through His Becoming Flesh Man Having the Concept of Worshipping God
[77]  The first step of God s wonderful way of salvation is His coming to be joined to man.
[78]  Not only are the uneducated countrymen fearful toward God, but also some famous scientists are filled with thoughts of worshipping God.
[79]  When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, outwardly His appearance was that of a man, but inwardly He was nothing less than the glorious and great God.
[80]  If He had come only with majesty and had suddenly appeared among men, it would have been a tremendous matter, and many people would have been so frightened that they would have prostrated themselves on the ground.
[81]  When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the little children were not afraid of Him, the lepers were not afraid of Him, and even the corrupted people were not afraid of Him Matt 19:13-15; 8:2-3; Luke 15:1 .
[82]  We can compare ourselves to an electric iron, God to the source of electricity, and Jesus Christ to the electricity.
[83]  If we remain plugged in, joined to Christ without any interruption, and open our heart to Him by praying to Him with our full attention, coming to Him and waiting on Him, His life will flow into us continuously.
[84]  I often say to Christians that if they quiet themselves before the Lord Jesus and pray earnestly to Him for an hour, their cold and hardened heart of hatred will be softened, set on fire, and full of love.
[85]  The longer we pray to the Lord Jesus, the more He comes to us and makes us willing to be filled with Him.
[86]  God is not merely sitting on His throne in heaven and commanding angels to rescue us, nor is He merely sending forth a surge of power to meet our need when we pray.
[87]  When He enters into man, He enters not as someone extraordinary but as the Spirit to be joined with man s spirit as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 ; thus, it is difficult for man to distinguish whether he is experiencing the Spirit of God or the spirit of man, or whether the one living is God or man.
[88]  Each step comes out of God s love for man, and none of these wonderful steps has ever come up in man s heart.
[89]  God does not save man merely outwardly, nor does He want man s salvation to be something apart from Him.
[90]  The substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus on the cross was not just a matter of virtue or sacrifice to obtain justice; it perfected the love of God and the righteousness of God toward man so that God s love and righteousness could be fully accomplished on man.
[91]  Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:5; John 1:1, 14; Matt 1:21-23; Isa 9:6
[92]  Beginning with this message, we will have four messages on the truth of the gospel.
[93]  When a person first receives the gospel, he usually is not very clear concerning the truth of the gospel.
[94]  The most important thing to know concerning the gospel is who Jesus is, because Jesus is the center of the gospel.
[95]  Although the existence of One sovereign God in the universe can be inferred from the things in the universe and the order in the universe, no man has ever seen God.
[96]  JESUS BEING GOD YET MAN AND MAN YET GOD
[97]  During the thirty-three and a half years that He lived on the earth, the Lord Jesus manifested both His divinity and His humanity.
[98]  In His humanity He was the same as all men: He became hungry when He did not eat, He became thirsty when He did not drink, He slept when He was tired, and He shed tears when He was sad.
[99]  He could raise men from the dead, and He knew the intentions within men s heart because He was the omnipotent and omniscient God.
[100]  If we want to know God, we need to look at Jesus; if we want to know man, we also need to look at Jesus.
[101]  If we want to know God, we must know the Lord Jesus; if we want to know man, we also must know the Lord Jesus.
[102]  This Jesus, whom we preach as our Savior, is the sovereign Lord in the universe, the God who created all things, who has become a man.
[103]  I believe we all can understand that the Lord Jesus is the sovereign Lord, the God who created and rules the heavens and the earth, who became a man to mingle God with man, and who died on the cross and resurrected to bring man into God.
[104]  CHAPTER ELEVEN JESUS BEING OUR SAVIOR Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21; Isa 53:5-6, 10; 1 Pet 1:13; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20
[105]  In the previous chapter we covered who the Lord Jesus is.
[106]  When she came to draw water, the Lord Jesus asked her to give Him a drink v. 7 , and He said, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water v. 10 . Then she asked the Lord for this water.
[107]  The second aspect of our problem is related to our inward nature.
[108]  The first aspect is our improper behavior; the second aspect is our evil nature.
[109]  We lie because our inward nature is deceitful, and we hate because our inward nature is envious of others.
[110]  With His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus solved the aspect of our problem associated with our sinful behavior.
[111]  As violations of God s righteousness, these sins make it impossible for us to escape His condemnation.
[112]  Although God desires to give us grace, the charges against us before God prevent Him from drawing near to us.
[113]  The Lord Jesus, through His Death and Resurrection, Solving the Aspect of Man s Life
[114]  The final aspect of our threefold problem is related to our life.
[115]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE WAY TO RECEIVE GOD S SALVATION Scripture Reading: Matt 22:4; Rom 10:6-11, 13; Acts 2:37-38; 16:30-31; 20:21 GOD S SALVATION BEING ACCOMPLISHED
[116]  As God, the Lord Jesus entered into us to become one with us in order to save us so that we would receive His life and salvation.
[117]  The Lord Jesus has accomplished everything for us in God s salvation.
[118]  Everyone who believes in and receives Him obtains God s life and can have a new living that is well pleasing to God.
[119]  Even though the Lord Jesus has borne our offenses, put our sinful nature to death, and can impart God s life into man, many still wonder how the Lord Jesus can enter into them and be joined with them.
[120]  We need to use the proper organ to receive God s salvation.
[121]  On the one hand, receiving God s salvation is like eating and drinking; we simply need to receive without being concerned whether our sins are small or big.
[122]  The key to receiving the Lord Jesus is to come, eat, drink, and enjoy Him.
[123]  I was truly touched by the Lord, and as soon as the meeting ended, I left the meeting place and spoke to the Lord on my way home, saying, O Lord Jesus, from today onward I do not want anything else but You.
[124]  Our Savior, the Lord Jesus, has accomplished everything related to our salvation.
[125]  Furthermore, those who believe in Jesus not only have the Bible in their hands but also the Holy Spirit within them.
[126]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE GOSPEL OF PEACE Scripture Reading: Luke 15:22-23; Eph 6:15 THE ITEMS OBTAINED BY
[127]  THE PRODIGAL SON IN LUKE 15 The Best Robe and the Fattened Calf
[128]  We all know the story of the prodigal son in chapter 15 of the Gospel of Luke.
[129]  When the son returned, the father told his slaves to bring out the best robe and put it on his son, to put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet, and to bring the fattened calf and slaughter it vv.
[130]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Rom 1:16; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 2 Cor 12:15; Phil 1:5 OUR COMMISSION TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[131]  Every saved person who has read the New Testament knows that the Lord Jesus left the believers with only one command: to preach the gospel to all the nations.
[132]  In Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord charged the disciples, saying, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[133]  In Mark 16:15 He also charged the disciples to preach the gospel, saying, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
[134]  In 1 Corinthians 9:16-17 he also spoke of his attitude toward the gospel, saying, If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
[135]  Christianity occupies an important position in human history because of its great impact and many adherents.
[136]  Consequently, it is worthwhile to study the matters of the Christian faith related to believing in Jesus Christ.
[137]  Those who say that God exists are strengthened when they speak of His existence, but those who say that God does not exist feel empty when they deny His existence.
[138]  The vastness of the universe is a strong argument for the existence of God.
[139]  Another strong argument relates to the origin of the universe.
[140]  Those who say that there is no God can only say that the universe came into being naturally, but this is a weak and irresponsible argument.
[141]  It is easy to rebut the point that the universe originated apart from God, because Romans 1:19 and 20 speak of the invisible things of God being manifested within man and to man, and that these invisible things are perceived by the things made.
[142]  The very fact that some people deny the existence of God when they speak of the creation of the universe shows that there is an understanding deep within them that the universe manifests the invisible things of God.
[143]  If God does not exist, there would be no need to deny His existence when looking at the things of the universe, because there would be no perception within people that these things come from God.
[144]  Not only does our body argue for the existence of God, but our heart does as well.
[145]  Even those who deny God with their words will call on God spontaneously when they are weak, when they face insurmountable obstacles, or when they are physically weak.
[146]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN WITHOUT GOD EVERYTHING BEING VAIN Scripture Reading: Eccl.
[147]  Hymns, #1080 speaks of the vanity of human life.
[148]  Regardless of the circumstances, man has a strong sense that things are vain if he is without God.
[149]  Just eating and sleeping is not God s original intention for man.
[150]  According to a Chinese saying, man is the spirit of all creatures.
[151]  In God s creation man was originally noble, extraordinary, and special.
[152]  The Bible is quite thorough in its speaking related to man s sins.
[153]  Jeremiah 17:9 says, The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?
[154]  Romans 3:10-18 says, There is none righteous, not even one; there is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God.
[155]  We do not need anyone to teach us how to lie.
[156]  Originally, God s intention was that man would be His dwelling place, but when man does not let God dwell in him, he is truly empty; and once he is empty, he becomes corrupt.
[157]  CHAPTER NINETEEN JESUS BEING GOD Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4, 14, 18; 3:31; 10:30; 14:9
[158]  In this chapter we want to consider who Jesus is.
[159]  Stanza 2 of Hymns, #84 says, Christ, by highest heav n adored, / Christ, the everlasting Lord: / Late in time behold Him come, / Offspring of a virgin s womb.
[160]  Because He has given us the Bible, God does not need to speak directly to every believer, and if we pay attention to the words in the Bible, we can hear God s speaking.
[161]  If you reply that He is a Savior, I need to ask, For whom did He come to save?
[162]  If Jesus were merely a man, He could not be man s Savior, because a man cannot save man.
[163]  CHAPTER TWENTY YOU NEED JESUS Scripture Reading: John 1:1-5, 14, 16-18; 15:4-5, 7-8 JESUS AS PORTRAYED IN THE GOSPELS
[164]  Many people do not understand why the Bible has four biographies of the Lord, but this is because there are many different aspects related to the Lord Jesus.
[165]  The Gospel of Luke speaks of the Lord Jesus as a perfect man who is the Savior of mankind, and the Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as God who comes to be life to His people.
[166]  If someone asked me what type of person I am, I would answer that I am like them all.
[167]  Practically speaking, these nine types represent nine aspects of man s inward condition.
[168]  THROUGH HIS SPEAKING Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21; 2 Sam 23:2 GOD DESIRING TO CONTACT MAN
[169]  The book of Genesis shows that man fell and was corrupted when he lost his connection with God.
[170]  Man became empty and corrupt when he lost God.
[171]  God is great and holy, and man is small and sinful; no man can stand before God.
[172]  Third, no book has as many prophecies as the Bible.
[173]  In fact, the prophecies in the Bible account for much of its content.
[174]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:37-38; 22:16; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12; 1 Pet 3:20-21; 1 Cor 10:1-2
[175]  In general, people have a wrong concept concerning believing in Jesus.
[176]  From our point of view, there have been many people who have lived on the earth from the ancient days until now.
[177]  Even though we know that the world s current population is a few billion, we do not know how many people have died or how many people are yet to be born.
[178]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 7:12-18, 21-25; 8:1-2
[179]  The law of the Spirit of life is the highest item in the New Testament.
[180]  If we would know God s relationship with us in Christ, we need to know this law.
[181]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE FLOWING OUT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:4; Gal 4:19; 2 Cor 4:7-11; Gal 2:20 THREE LAWS IN MAN
[182]  In the previous chapter we saw the law of the Spirit of life as a principle.
[183]  However, when a man is saved, God s life enters into him; hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in a believer s spirit.
[184]  In man s soul there is the human life, in man s body there is the devil s life, and in man s spirit there is God s life.
[185]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:5; 1 John 2:27
[186]  The Gospel of John and the first Epistle of John contain numerous references to abiding in the Lord John 15:4-7; 1 John 2:24, 27-28; 4:13 .
[187]  Since John s writings are focused on life, we must be clear about the matter of abiding in the Lord.
[188]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-9; 10:9-16; 13:2; Gal 1:16; 2:1-2; Eph 1:17 SERVICE ACCORDING TO NATURE
[189]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-8; 1 Pet 4:10-11 THE NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE
[190]  The service of the church is the corporate service of all the saints in a local church.
[191]  In the Bible the church refers to both the house of God and the Body of Christ Eph 2:19; 1:22-23 .
[192]  The house of God is a matter of enjoyment, whereas the Body of Christ is a matter of service.
