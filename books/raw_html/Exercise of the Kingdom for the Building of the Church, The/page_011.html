         <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEARING THE CROSS<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew various points are put together to reveal a doctrine. This is what Matthew did in chapter sixteen. After giving the revelation concerning Christ and the church, he unveiled the way the church is built.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; How can the church be built up in a practical way? The answer is found in verses 21 through 26. According to biblical terms, the way to build up the church is to be crucified and resurrected. Unless Christ had been crucified and resurrected, He could not build up the church. The church came into existence through His death and resurrection. Verse 21 says, &ldquo;From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the way to build up the church is through death and resurrection. On the mount the Lord Jesus was transfigured. This transfiguration, however, was temporary. Through death and resurrection, Christ was permanently transfigured. Resurrection is a form of transfiguration. Through death and resurrection, Christ has entered into a realm of transfiguration. The church exists in this realm of transfiguration. It cannot exist in the natural life or with fleshly people. It can only exist in a realm of transfiguration. As long as we are in a natural realm or in a fleshly condition, we are through with the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PETER&rsquo;S DISSENSION</h2>
<p>In verse 21 the Lord revealed the way to build the church. However, the one to whom He had given the keys of the kingdom did not agree with this way. When the Lord spoke to Peter regarding death and resurrection, Peter dissented and rebuked Him. Verse 22 says, &ldquo;And Peter, taking Him to him, began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; But if this had not happened to the Lord, the church could have by no means been built up. If Peter, the one who received the keys, could be so dissenting, then any of us can be dissenting also. The history of Christianity is a history of dissension. The source of this dissension is Satan who comes out from Hades through the self. When the gate of self is open, Satan comes out to dissent.</p>
<p>When Peter rebuked the Lord, he was one with Satan. For this reason, verse 23 says, &ldquo;But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.&rdquo; Here we see that Peter and Satan were one. Thus, the Lord rebuked Peter by calling him Satan and saying that he was a stumbling block to Him. The Lord also pointed out that Peter was not setting his mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING UP THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus did not say to deny Satan, but to deny the self. Satan and self are synonymous terms used interchangeably by the Lord. To deny the self is negative. In this message we need to see something on the positive side. The positive side is the matter of taking up the cross and following the Lord. We all have our cross. The Lord&rsquo;s cross is unique, but our crosses are many. In order for the church to be built, the Lord Jesus had to take up His cross, and we also must take up our cross.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, this matter of taking up the cross and bearing the cross has been grossly misunderstood. For example, a brother who has lost a great deal of money in business may say that he must bear the cross. The book <em>The Imitation of Christ,</em> supposedly written by Thomas &#224; Kempis, has been a help to many Christians. Nevertheless, that book contains an error: the concept that our human sufferings should be regarded as bearing the cross. This concept is very much like Hinduism. This is also a pronounced weakness of today&rsquo;s Catholicism, which emphasizes our need to suffer. Thus, the concept of suffering has crept into the Christian religion. In her biography, Madame Guyon says that she even asked for crosses. This comes from the natural concept.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
