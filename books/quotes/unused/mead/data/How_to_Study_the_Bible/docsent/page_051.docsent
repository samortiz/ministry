   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Are the angels who leave their own place among the one third who fall in Revelation 12:4, or are they different ones?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe they are different from the original third who fell with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first part of Jude 6 says, "And angels who did not keep their own principality but abandoned their own dwelling place."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word principality is translated as "original state" by Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It refers not only to their original place but to their original state.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, the angels did not marry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For them to not keep their own state means that they engaged themselves in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Principality refers to their state, and dwelling place refers to their place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What has happened to these angels?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last part of verse 6 says that these angels are "kept in eternal bonds under gloom for the judgment of the great day."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 7 provides a further explanation of verse 6; it does not refer to something new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The grammar of Darby s and Stevens's translations indicates that verse 7 is a further explanation of verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These angels are like those in "Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after different flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are "set forth as an example" and will undergo "the penalty of eternal fire."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These verses are speaking not of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah who committed fornication but of the angels who committed fornication like the men of Sodom and Gomorrah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, they were given to fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, they did nothing except commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They forgot about everything else and only engaged in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They "went after different flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, they are "set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can say that Jude 6 and 7 are an exposition of Genesis 6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us use another difficult passage in the Bible as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 20:23 says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is indeed a difficult passage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can man have the authority to forgive other men's sins?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Roman Catholic Church used this verse as the basis for selling indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, this verse must be linked to the preceding verse which speaks of receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the Lord has given the Holy Spirit to His church so that the church, as His representative and vessel, can forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We call this kind of forgiveness "instrumental forgiveness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose I am preaching the gospel, and I come across a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He confesses that he is a sinner and asks God for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He weeps, cries, repents, and sincerely accepts the Lord Jesus, but he can still be ignorant of the matter of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone in the church stands up and declares to him, "God has forgiven your sins," this declaration is most helpful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church can decide who is qualified to be baptized and who is eligible for the Lord's table because it has received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Under the authority of the Holy Spirit, it can exercise its instrumental power to forgive or retain men's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church can only forgive as it is abiding in the Holy Spirit and breathing in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can forgive when he is standing in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we realize that this forgiveness is an instrumental forgiveness, we will have no problem with this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The above verses serve as two illustrations of dealing with difficult passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The interpretation of any difficult passage in the Bible must be supported by enough proof and must take care of the context of the passage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can expound out of context or be guided by prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>XXIII.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BOOK BY BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can also study the Bible book by book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can go through the Pentateuch, the books of history, the Psalms, and the books of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The content of each book should be memorized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In studying the books of the prophets, we have to find out how many of the prophets lived before the captivity and how many lived during and after the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The study of the New Testament has to be conducted in the same manner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to know the historical part of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to know the Epistles to the churches, the Epistles to individuals, and the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A child of God may not need to expound every book of the Bible, but he must at least know the contents of each book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to spend at least two years to get an overview of all sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want more in-depth knowledge, we have to spend five or six years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we become familiar with the contents of each book, we will know the nature of each book, and we will be able to relate one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, we can link our study of the Old Testament to the books of Romans, Ephesians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are basic skills, and we have to pay attention to them.</S>
