   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE DYING TO LIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the Bible, death and resurrection are vital both to our Christian life and to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apart from death and resurrection, it is impossible for God to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout God's creation we see the principle of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, if a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it will produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For a single grain to die and bear much fruit means that it is multiplied into many other grains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also see death and resurrection illustrated in the hatching of a chicken out from an egg.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the shell is broken, the life within it is released, and a baby chicken comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the process of death and resurrection is illustrated by the metabolism that takes place in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In metabolism something is always dying, and something else is rising up in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, metabolism is actually a process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within us something is always dying so that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because this matter of death and resurrection is so important to our Christian life, I am burdened to give still another message on the subject of dying to live, a message that will help us see how to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we may recognize the need to die, we may not know how to die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Recently, a number of saints have testified that although they have tried to die, they have not been successful in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only is it difficult to die; it is even difficult to point out the way to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been in the process of dying for more than fifty years, and I am still learning how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although it is very difficult to explain what is the way to die, in this message I shall try my best to present the way to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GOD WANTING US TO DIE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regarding this matter, the first thing we Christians need to realize is that God wants us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some Christians hold the mistaken concept that God wants us to die because we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may say, "I don't like my sinful old man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because he is so evil, he must die."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were saved, we loved ourselves a great deal and appreciated ourselves very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But once our being was exposed to the light, we began to hate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more light we receive from the Lord, the more we are exposed; and the more we are exposed, the more we hate our ugly self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, many Christians think that we must die because we are so evil, sinful, and ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This concept, however, is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus had to die, not only on the cross, but also daily during His life on earth, and He certainly was not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, He was altogether right and lovable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was nothing evil about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, even such a pure, perfect, lovable, and sinless Person had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He came forth to minister, the first thing He did was to present Himself to John the Baptist to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even the Lord Jesus had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would know how to die, we need to see clearly that the reason we must die is not because we are sinful, but simply because we are human.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since you are a human being, God wants you to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This has nothing to do with being evil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, the better you are, the more you need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we need to have a change of concept about the necessity of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must die because God's economy requires us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even the Lord Jesus, the holy, perfect, sinless, lovable One, had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must die also, not because we are evil, but because we are human.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that you must die because you hate others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No, you must die because you love others so much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more loving we are, the more we need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's economy requires this.</S>
