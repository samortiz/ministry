<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is a collection of messages given by Witness Lee in Hong Kong in October and November 1955. Consisting of twenty-one chapters, this book focuses on the matter of life as the central goal of God in the universe. It also speaks of how God can be life to man and how man can live an overcoming life unto the maturity in life. The messages have been translated from the original Chinese.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING GOD&rsquo;S CENTRAL GOAL<br />
IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION<br />
ENABLING US TO KNOW GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:17 says, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&rdquo; In this verse the apostle speaks of a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order that we may know God. In other words, if we desire to know God, we must have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">First Wisdom, Then Revelation</h2>
<p>We often think that wisdom comes from revelation, but instead of starting with revelation, this verse speaks first of wisdom. A person must first have wisdom, not revelation, in order to know spiritual matters. We think that it does not matter whether we have wisdom, because we will know spiritual matters when the Holy Spirit comes and gives us revelation and seeing. But this is not the case in reality. A person must have spiritual wisdom first and then spiritual revelation in order to know spiritual matters. Wisdom is related mainly to our mind, but revelation is mainly in our spirit. If we are void of wisdom in our mind, we will not understand spiritual matters even if we have received a revelation in our spirit.</p>
<p>For example, a large factory with many different machines may be opened for students to visit. This opening, in spiritual terms, is a revelation. Formerly this factory was closed to people; it was a mystery. People could not see or even know the actual situation of the factory, but once the factory is revealed and opened, everything is within plain sight of the students. Because of inadequate training in mechanical knowledge, however, a student may still not understand what he has seen. He does not have the capacity to understand the machinery. On the contrary, another student may have studied three or four years of mechanical engineering, gained a certain amount of knowledge concerning machinery, and been trained in his mind with a knowledge of mechanics; that is, he has wisdom concerning machinery. When the factory is opened to him, he will understand the machines as soon as he sees them. Hence, we need to see that even if a person has revelation, he may still not have understanding; he must first have wisdom. One who does not have wisdom will not have understanding, even if he has revelation. In order to see revelation and understand the significance of revelation, one must first be equipped with wisdom. This is the reason the apostle spoke first of wisdom and then of revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Wisdom Requiring Training<br />
to Understand Revelation</h2>
<p>It is the same in our experience. While revelation can be seen instantly, wisdom requires preparation over a long period of time; this is the reason we need training. Formerly, when we had problems and needs in our service, we often could not find the way to deal with the problems and meet the needs. It has only been in recent years that we have found the way and realized the source of the problem; that is, even though we have a heart for the Lord, we are short of spiritual wisdom, which comes from training.</p>
<p>Because of our lack of training and practice, we have been short of spiritual wisdom, and because of our lack of spiritual wisdom, we have been unable to understand the spiritual revelation that has been given to us. Therefore, over the past few years, we have placed a special emphasis on training, and our expectation is that we will be prepared for the spiritual matters. This preparation is to lay a foundation for wisdom so that we may develop a common sense in our mind, thoughts, and perception. Then when the Holy Spirit enlightens us and gives us an inspiration or a revelation, we will be able to understand it readily.</p>
<p>Some people strongly question whether our trainings should be for training our minds. What they mean is that our trainings are not spiritual enough. It is true that our trainings, for the most part, focus on training one&rsquo;s mind. But please remember that if we pay attention only to being spiritual and neglect the training of the mind, we will still have no way to be spiritual in the end. When a factory is opened to someone who has spent five to ten years in mechanical engineering, he is able to understand and comprehend the machinery in the factory. However, if someone has not received training, he will not be able to understand anything when a factory is opened to him. Even after he has examined every piece of machinery, it will be as if he has not seen anything.</p>
<p>If we have not been trained and have not learned how to meet, we will not know what to do and how to release the inspiration that the Holy Spirit gives us; this is because we do not have wisdom. If we have been trained and our mind has received practice in spiritual matters with spiritual wisdom as a foundation, we will have the wisdom to follow the inspiration and meet the need of the revelation when we receive inspiration and revelation in the meetings. As trained ones, we will be able to offer a prayer immediately, release a testimony, or select a hymn.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we listen to the prayers of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we can tell there is a problem with their person even though their spirit is strong. This is because their mind is confused and their thinking has not been trained. While they have revelation, they are short of wisdom. Of course, we cannot rely on wisdom alone. If we rely only on wisdom, we will be fully of the mind. Therefore, we need both wisdom and revelation. It is a spirit of wisdom and revelation that enables us to know God. Hence, we need to be trained so that we may lay a foundation of wisdom in all spiritual matters and be able to apply wisdom when the revelation of the Holy Spirit comes.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE BEING THE MINGLING<br />
OF THE CREATED LIFE WITH THE UNCREATED LIFE</h2>
<p>First John 1 speaks of the &ldquo;fellowship of life.&rdquo; We all know that the central goal of the Bible is life, and the central goal of the universe is also life. The record of creation in Genesis 1 and 2 shows that life is the center of everything. Many scientists consider the record in Genesis to be meaningless because it contains no record of the great matters in the universe related to astronomy and geography; instead, it records matters that are of no interest to astronomers, geographers, and scientists. The center of this record is life. In brief, on the first and second days, there was no life. On the third day, God caused the dry land to appear that plants might grow. On the third day, there was plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness, without feeling. The plant life is the first kind of life spoken of in creation, and this life is the lowest life. On the fifth and sixth days, the record goes from the lowest animal life to the higher mammal life, and among the mammals, the highest is the human life.</p>
<p>Thus, at the end of the record of creation, the human life created by God is the highest life among created life. Once this life was created, God&rsquo;s image and authority are present. Both image and authority come with the highest created life. In other words, once human life was created, God&rsquo;s image was with this human life, and God&rsquo;s authority was also committed to this human life. All these matters are recorded in Genesis 1. On the sixth day, when man was created, it can be said that life reached its highest point. But, in fact, this is still not the highest life. Hence, in chapter 2, God put the man He created in front of another life, the divine life. God put man in front of the tree of life (v. 9); that is, He put man in front of the divine life.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, the divine life is the highest life in the universe. As far as created life is concerned, human life is the highest life; however, apart from created life, there is still an uncreated life, as indicated by the tree of life, the eternal life of God. To put created life in front of uncreated life implies that the created life should receive the uncreated life, and the two should mingle together. This is the fellowship of life. The joining together of the created life with the uncreated life is the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Coming from Light</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 and 2 show that life comes from light. The record of God&rsquo;s creation tells the story of creation in seven days. On the first day, God said, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; and there was light (1:3). On the second day, God separated the waters above from the waters below. On the third day, the dry land appeared, and there was the lowest plant life. On the fourth day, the light was intensified, and the sun, the moon, and the stars were manifested; once light becomes stronger, life also becomes stronger. The light on the first day is for producing plant life on the third day; the light on the fourth day is for producing animal life on the fifth and sixth days. Thus, the plant life was produced by the light of the first day, and the animal life was produced by the light of the fourth day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being in the Incarnated Christ</h2>
<p>When we come to the tree of life in Genesis 2, we may not realize the kind of life that is referred to by &ldquo;the tree of life.&rdquo; Psalm 36:9 says, &ldquo;With You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; This shows that the source of life is God. At this point, we may have a little realization that the source of life for the tree of life is God. However, this is not clear enough. If we continue our reading concerning the line of life and pay attention to life, we will eventually come to John 1:4, which says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Here <em>Him</em> refers to the <em>Word</em> in verse 1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The <em>Word</em> was God, and in Him was life. Now we should be clearer that the life in the incarnated Christ is what is spoken of in Genesis 2.</p>
<p>However, because this is still not enough, we need to read further. John 11:25 says, &ldquo;I am...the life.&rdquo; Then 14:6 says, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; We need to be clear that the life spoken of in Genesis 2 is the incarnated God. The incarnated God is life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 10:10 says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo;; then 1 John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Also, Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; Finally, Revelation 22:2 speaks of the tree of life. We may say that the tree of life in the beginning of the Bible reappears at the end of the Bible after passing through the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being the Central Goal<br />
in the Entire Universe</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation, life is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal and the ultimate enjoyment of the believers. In Genesis 2, God put man in front of the tree of life for man to receive life; in Revelation 22, the tree of life has entered into man to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment. In the beginning of the Bible, the created life was put in front of the tree of life in order that the created life might receive the tree of life. At the end of the Bible, the tree of life has become the enjoyment of the created life. The created and the uncreated life are fully mingled as one. Hence, life is the central goal of the entire Bible, and in the whole universe, life is the central goal of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD AS LIFE COMING TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h1>
<p>In the Bible God&rsquo;s central goal is life, and also in the whole universe God&rsquo;s central goal is life. This is a record in the Bible and a fact in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING GOD&rsquo;S CENTRAL GOAL IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>Some people may ask, &ldquo;How can we say that God&rsquo;s central goal in the universe is life?&rdquo; This can be seen from the revelation of the entire Scriptures. From the outset the Bible is a record of how God created the universe and all things and how He created man and put him in front of the tree of life. If we consider the first two chapters of Genesis, we will see a picture with the tree of life at its center. God created the heavens and the earth, and in the realm of the universe God caused the plants to grow and the birds of heaven to be brought forth. He also caused the fish of the sea, the cattle of the earth, and the insects and wild animals to come forth according to their kind. Then God created man and pointed out one item to him&mdash;the tree of life. God put man, whom He created, in front of the tree of life so that man might receive life.</p>
<p>The picture in Genesis shows the situation of the universe, the story of the universe. At the center of this picture is the tree of life. Therefore, God&rsquo;s central goal in the universe is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life and Light</h2>
<p>In the sixty-six books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, life is mentioned repeatedly. The first mention of life in the Bible is in Genesis 2; then Psalm 36:9 says, &ldquo;With You is the fountain of life; / In Your light we see light.&rdquo; Here we see a wonderful principle in the Bible: life is always spoken of in conjunction with light; life accompanies light, and life is in the light. Psalm 36:9 particularly speaks of this life. Since life is in God and God is light, life is in the light. Life is wrapped up with light and is contained in the light. Psalm 133 speaks of the brothers dwelling in unity, and at the end it says, &ldquo;For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever&rdquo; (v. 3). In this psalm life is spoken of again.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; Here life and light are spoken of together again. The difference here is that the light spoken of in John is light that has shined forth, and the light spoken of in Psalm 36 is light as the source of life. On one hand, light is the source of life, and on the other hand, light has shined forth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 11:25 says, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo;; 14:6 says, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life&rdquo;; and 10:10 says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life.&rdquo; Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; First John 5:11 says, &ldquo;This life is in His [God&rsquo;s] Son&rdquo;; therefore, &ldquo;he who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (v. 12). Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life is in the New Jerusalem. This shows that the scene in the universe recorded at the end of the Bible also has life as its center. Life is at the center of the new heaven and new earth in the new universe in the future. From beginning to end, the record of the Bible shows that life is the center of the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bible Being a Book on Life</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the Bible there is a picture, and also at the end of the Bible there is a picture. The picture at the beginning of the Bible portrays the first universe, the old universe. In the old universe God&rsquo;s focus is on life. The picture at the end of the Bible portrays a new universe. In the new universe God&rsquo;s focus is also on life. This shows that in the entire universe God&rsquo;s focus is on life; the central goal in the universe is life. Since God&rsquo;s focus in the universe is on life, His focus in the record of the Bible is also on life because it is a story of the universe; every important matter in the universe is recorded in the Bible. Since the facts are focused on life, the record is surely also focused on life. Therefore, the Bible is a book on life, a book with life as its subject. Since life is the focus of the universe, and since the Bible reveals the mystery of the universe and describes the story of the universe, certainly its content also is focused on life. Although some people say that the Bible speaks of this and others say that the Bible speaks of that, in reality the Bible is a book on life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Pictures at the Beginning and<br />
the End of the Bible</h2>
<p>All of the sixty-six books in the Bible are on life. From the beginning in Genesis 2 life is revealed. It shows from whom life comes, through whom it passes, and into whom it enters. Life comes from God, passes through Christ and the Holy Spirit, and enters into us to be our life. The record at the end of Revelation is also on life. The pictures at the beginning of Genesis and at the end of Revelation focus on life. What is the difference between these two pictures? In the first picture the created life was put in front of the uncreated life so that the former might receive the latter. In other words, the two lives had no relationship. In the second picture the created life has received the uncreated life, and the uncreated life has become the enjoyment of the created life; thus, the two lives have become one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being the Means<br />
for the Mingling of God and Man</h2>
<p>In the first picture the two lives are separate from each other and are even the opposite of each other. Yet in the second picture the two have become one; the uncreated life has been mingled with the created life. Man represents the created life, and God represents the uncreated life. Hence, the mingling of the created life with the uncreated life is the mingling of man and God. At the beginning of Genesis, God was God, and man was man. The two were separate from each other; they were not mingled together. At the end of Revelation, however, God and man, man and God, are mingled together.</p>
<p>How can God and man be mingled together? How can God be mingled with man? The mingling of God and man is the mingling of life; God mingles with man in the way of life. Man is a created life, and God is the uncreated life. The mingling of these two lives is the mingling of God and man. But how can these two lives be mingled together? How can man be mingled with God? For man to be mingled with God, he must receive God&rsquo;s life. Unless man receives God&rsquo;s life, he cannot be mingled with God. Therefore, the mingling of God and man is altogether by life and through life.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD COMING TO BE LIFE TO MAN</h2>
<p>We have seen that the central goal of God in the universe is life. Now we need to see how God came to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled with man. God&rsquo;s focus is on life, which is simply God Himself. Therefore, for God to take life as the center of the universe means that He takes Himself as the center of the universe. For Him to put His life into man means that He desires to put Himself into man. For Him to desire man to receive life means that He desires man to receive Himself. When life enters into man, God enters man. We would never say that God is God, that life is life, and that God and life are separate from each other. Actually, God is life, and life is God; the two cannot be separated. When life is separated from God, it is no longer life. Life is not only in God, but life is God. Hence, Psalm 36 says that life is in God and that the source of life is with God.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament we can see life, but we cannot easily see what life is. It is not until the New Testament that we see that life is God Himself. The incarnated Christ is God on one hand and life on the other hand. Christ is God, and Christ is life; therefore, God is life. Furthermore, we know assuredly that God became flesh in order that we may receive Him as life. In His incarnation, He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (John 10:10). The life in us is God Himself. God became flesh so that man might receive Him as life. He said that He was the living bread which came down out of heaven (6:51); this means that God became man and came among men because He desires to be the living bread so that men can receive Him as their life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being God Himself</h2>
<p>We often say that we have received the life of God, but in fact, the Bible rarely uses the expression <em>the life of God</em> and almost never says that God desires us to receive His life. Instead, the Bible says that God is life. For example, in John 11:25, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am...the life,&rdquo; and Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; We often say that we have received God&rsquo;s life, but strictly speaking, we have not received God&rsquo;s life; rather, we have received God Himself as our life. We obtain our physical life from our father, but we cannot say that our father is our life. For our spiritual life, however, not only have we received the divine life from God, but we have also received God Himself as our life, because God&rsquo;s life cannot be separated from God Himself. God&rsquo;s life is God Himself; it is impossible for God to give His life to us without His coming into us. In order for us to receive God&rsquo;s life, we must receive God Himself. Since life is God, it is impossible for us to receive only God&rsquo;s life but not God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being Life</h2>
<p>The manifestation of life, however, is not that simple. First, this life exists from eternity, from the beginning. First John 1:1 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning...concerning the...life&rdquo;; this life was in eternity past without beginning. This life was in the beginning and is called the Father. Therefore, the Father is the origin. At a certain time He was manifested, and this life was seen in the Son. Therefore, the Son is the expression.</p>
<p>When the Son was manifested, He clearly said, &ldquo;I am...the life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have come that they may have life.&rdquo; Then Paul says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo;; the Son is our life. John went on to say concerning the Son, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (1 John 5:12). This means that the Son is life expressed, but the story of this life does not stop here. The Son went through human living on earth and eventually died on the cross; after three days He resurrected from the dead and became the Spirit. At this time, this life is seen in the Spirit. This life is in the Spirit.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8:2, after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit is called the Spirit of life, proving that life is in the Spirit and that the Spirit is life; hence, the Spirit is called the Spirit of life. John 7:38 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me,...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The rivers of living water are life. Then the next verse continues, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&rdquo; (v. 39). The rivers of living water actually denote the life of the Son; this can be proven by John 4:14, where the Lord explicitly said that the water that He will give to those who receive Him will become a fountain in them. Then in chapter 7, He said that the living water refers to &ldquo;the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&rdquo; (v. 39). Glorification refers to the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>At that time, because Jesus was not yet resurrected, the Spirit was not yet; however, when Jesus was resurrected, the Spirit came. The Spirit is the living water as life in those who believe into the Lord Jesus. When we put John chapters 4 and 7 and Romans chapter 8 together, we see that after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit is life. Therefore, life is God Himself. In eternity past, life could be seen in the Father; when He was manifested among men, life was seen in the Son; after passing through death and resurrection, life can be seen in the Spirit. Hence, life is related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD MINGLING HIMSELF WITH MAN<br />
BY BEING MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CENTRAL GOAL BEING LIFE</h2>
<p>We all know that God&rsquo;s central goal in the universe is life and that God Himself comes to be our life. God comes to be our life, not to be our power, because He desires to mingle Himself with us. God comes to be our life in order to mingle Himself with us; there is no way that is more practical than this.</p>
<p>It is true that God is life, but He also has come to be our life. Paul says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4). Christ, who is life, is now in us as our life. This life is Christ Himself; only by coming into us to be our life can Christ be mingled practically with us.</p>
<p>In order for a lamb or a cow to be mingled with us, it must be eaten. Only by being eaten, digested, and assimilated can they get into us and be mingled with us. Eating is a matter of life. Thus, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven;...the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world&rdquo; (John 6:51). Then He continued, &ldquo;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves&rdquo; (v. 53). This means we must eat Him and drink Him; when we eat and drink Him, we have life within us. Here we see that there is only one way, one method, for God to mingle Himself with us, and this way, this method, is life. If God was not our life, He would have no way to mingle Himself with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING MAN&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
THROUGH MAN&rsquo;S EATING AND DRINKING</h2>
<p>In the Bible, the thought of God becoming our life through eating and drinking is deep and profound. But among Christians, this thought does not have much weight or ground. We have never had the thought that God&rsquo;s coming to be our life is similar to a cow or a lamb becoming our life by being killed and taken into us, but this is the thought of the Bible. In John 6:27 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life.&rdquo; This verse speaks of two kinds of food: one is the food which perishes, and the other is the food which abides unto eternal life. The eternal life of God is God Himself. Therefore, the food that abides unto eternal life is also God Himself. God Himself is our food. This is not merely a matter of enjoyment but of constitution. When food is taken into us and becomes our enjoyment, it is digested in us to become a part of us, and eventually, it is constituted into us and mingled with us.</p>
<p>When we eat food such as beef, lamb, bread, vegetables, and eggs, it is a pleasure and enjoyment, but the ultimate result is that the food is digested into us to become our blood, our flesh, and our life constituents. All the readers of the Bible know that eating and drinking are symbols. Our need to eat food and drink water signifies our need to eat and drink God, that is, to take God into us by eating Him and drinking Him. This kind of speaking may sound wild, but actually it is expressive and practical. In John 6 the Lord told us to work for the food which abides unto eternal life, not for the food which perishes. This work issues in gaining God Himself. Because the Jews did not understand what the Lord said, He later told them that He was the bread of life which came down out of heaven, that He was food, and that those who ate Him would have eternal life. The eternal life is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD MINGLING HIMSELF WITH MAN<br />
BY BECOMING MAN&rsquo;S FOOD</h2>
<p>If we study John 6 carefully, we will see that the Lord came to earth for one purpose&mdash;to enter into man and become man&rsquo;s life. He can enter into us and become our life when we take Him in as food. Preachers often tell people that without God, man is empty and unsatisfied, but with God, man is satisfied. This can be likened to the fact that without food, one&rsquo;s stomach is empty; with food, one&rsquo;s stomach is full. This is a simple illustration. Not only does food satisfy man and become man&rsquo;s enjoyment, but it is also received, digested, and assimilated by man to be mingled with man and become man&rsquo;s element. This mingling is so practical and subjective. After food is taken into us, it is not only mingled with us, but it also becomes our element, our blood and flesh. This shows that God desires to give Himself to us as food so that He may not only satisfy us and become our enjoyment but also may be digested in us and become our element. If God did not come to be our life in this way, He would have no way to mingle Himself with us and work Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE NOT BEING SEPARATED<br />
FROM EATING AND DRINKING</h2>
<p>We all know that the entire Bible is about life, but when life is spoken of, eating and drinking are spoken of as well. When Genesis 2 speaks of the tree of life, the matter of eating is mentioned immediately (vv. 9, 16-17). In the age of the New Testament the Lord Jesus came. When He revealed that He wanted man to receive Him as life, He also spoke of the matter of eating. He said, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&rdquo; (John 6:54). In His conversation with the Samaritan woman, the Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo; (4:13-14). This shows how the Lord used eating and drinking to speak about the matter of receiving.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:1-2 also speaks of life, saying, &ldquo;A river of water of life...in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits.&rdquo; Then verse 17 says, &ldquo;Let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; At the end of the Bible, when life is spoken of, the matter of eating and drinking is referred to in regard to eating the fruits of the tree of life and drinking the river of water of life. Therefore, the entire Bible speaks not only of life but also of eating and drinking. Life cannot be separated from eating and drinking.</p><h2 class="head1">HE WHO EATS THE LORD LIVING BECAUSE OF HIM</h2>
<p>In John 6:53-56, the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in Him.&rdquo; We need to see that whenever we eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drink the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we are joined to the Lord Jesus in a very subjective way; He and we are in each other.</p>
<p>Verse 57 continues, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; Translators of the Bible into Chinese rendered the phrase <em>he who eats Me</em>as &ldquo;he who eats My flesh.&rdquo; Actually, the Lord meant that He desired us to eat Him. Although the expression &ldquo;to eat Him&rdquo; may sound wild, it is exactly what the Lord meant. He who eats Him will live because of Him. Has there ever been one who has actually eaten the flesh of the Lord Jesus? No. But we have all received the Lord Jesus into us. We must see that God desires us to take Him in as food. He gives Himself to us as food to eat because He desires to be digested in us. This is the reason God must come to be our life. If God were not our life, He could not be digested in us, joined to us, and mingled with us to become our inward constituents.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD COMING TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
BEING THE FOCUS OF HIS WORK IN MAN</h2>
<p>In order to mingle with man, God has to come to be our life. His coming to be our Savior, power, and wisdom does not reach His goal of mingling Himself with us. He must first come to be our life, and then all these other things can be added. All these other matters depend on His being our life. His being our power is based upon His being our life, His being our Savior is based upon His being our life, and His being our everything is based upon His being our life. If God were not our life, He could not be anything to us. God being our life is a central matter; it is the focus of all His work in us. His being our power, healing, comfort, Savior, and even our Lord depend on this matter. In other words, if He were not our life, He could not do anything in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT BEING LIFE</h2>
<p>Since God being our life by being digested, mingled, and constituted into us is a central matter, we need to see more concerning this life. God Himself is life, but how many processes or stages are involved in His becoming our life? In each of the processes, how is He identified? We need to know all these matters. From eternity, from the beginning, God is life. In eternity, the Father is the source of life. One day, the Father, who is the source of life, was manifested among men. First John 1:1-2 clearly says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us).&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the Son, and His name is Jesus. The Gospel of John records that everyone who believes into the Son should have eternal life (6:40); the Son is life. The Son, having passed through His human living on the earth was crucified and resurrected to become the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Life and the Spirit are one; thus, the Spirit is life. John 20 says that in the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He came to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; From that moment, the Lord who is the Spirit was with the disciples (vv. 19-22). The Lord as the Spirit dwelling in the disciples was their life because the Spirit is life. This shows that the Father is life, the Son is life, and also the Spirit is life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY GOD&rsquo;S LIFE BEING LIFE</h2>
<p>In the universe, besides the life of God, all other kinds of life cannot be considered as life. In the universe there is plant life, lower animal life, higher animal life, human life, and angelic life. In terms of nature and principle, however, these different kinds of life cannot be considered as life. The real nature and principle of life is that it is ever-living, ever-existing, indestructible, unchangeable, and incorruptible. Only God Himself is life because only God is eternal, ever-existing, unchanging, and incorruptible. Only God Himself is divine and eternal, and only God Himself is life. Therefore, only God&rsquo;s life can be considered as life. God&rsquo;s life is the unique life in the universe. Only by having this life can one have life; without this life, one cannot have life.</p>
<p>The life of God is in His Son Jesus Christ; hence, 1 John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; This means that with the Son, there is life, and without the Son, there is no life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD FLOWING INTO MAN TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>God is life. In order for Him to enter into us to be our life, He must flow Himself out. If He did not flow out, we would have no way to contact Him, let alone receive Him. If He did not flow out, He would have no way to enter into us. In Genesis 2, immediately after speaking of the tree of life, there is mention of a flowing river (vv. 9-10). Therefore, after speaking of life, the Bible goes on to speak of a river. God&rsquo;s coming to be our life is absolutely related to a river.</p>
<p>First, this river flowed from the throne to Jesus the Nazarene. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a river of life flowing among men but not yet flowing into them. Therefore, He needed a second step, which was to go to the cross so that His flesh would be broken, just as the rock was cleft in the Old Testament. Then from His inner being, life flowed forth, becoming rivers of living water. The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life, originating from the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration. The Lord, as the Spirit, not only can appear among men but also enter into men. Hence, John 7:38 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; From the innermost being of those who believe into Him flow rivers of living water. Then verse 39 continues, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; This means that the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself, has entered into those who believe into Him to become the living water of life in them.</p>
<p>At this time we can say that God has truly entered into us to be our life. This is the flowing out of God. God flowed out through the Lord Jesus and flowed into us; this is life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW GOD CAN BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING THE TRIUNE GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s central goal in the universe and in the Bible is life. The word <em>life</em> indicates that God desires to be man&rsquo;s life. In terms of the nature and significance of life in the universe, only God&rsquo;s life is life because only God&rsquo;s life is eternal and incorruptible. Life is the flowing out of God and also the content of God; this life is God Himself.</p>
<p>In brief, life is the Triune God. But to us, this life is not the Triune God who is only in heaven but the Triune God who has flowed out. The Triune God first flowed out with Himself as the content through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, and then He flowed out through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection as the Spirit in order for us to receive Him as our life. Hence, when we touch God in the pneumatic Christ, we touch life, because life is God as the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>We all know that God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit. The Father is in the Son so that He may be expressed among men; the Son is the Father&rsquo;s expression. The Son became the Spirit so that He could enter into man; the Spirit is the entering in of the Son. The Father is the source of life; He is life itself. The Son is the expression of the Father (1 Tim. 3:16), and He is the expression of life (1 John 1:2). The Spirit is the entering in of the Son; He is the entering in of life. The life in the Father was manifested in the Son among men and realized as the Spirit to enter into man and be experienced by man. Therefore, the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), through whom man can receive life; moreover, the mind set on the Spirit is life (v. 6). Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, when a person touches the Spirit with his spirit, he touches life; when he contacts the Spirit, he contacts life; and when he obeys the Spirit, he experiences life.</p>
<p>God is the Triune God. The Father is in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit. To us, the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in of God. The Father is expressed in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into us. Thus, life is the Triune God. The Father is the source of life, the Son is the expression of life, and the Spirit is the entering of life. There is no such thought in our human mind. The most that we have are ethics, morality, and philosophies which teach us to be humble, meek, patient, and forbearing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LORD JESUS<br />
BEING THE MANIFESTATION OF LIFE</h2>
<p>There are two verses in the New Testament which indicate that the manifestation of the Lord Jesus in the flesh is the manifestation of God and that the manifestation of the Lord Jesus is the manifestation of life. These are the two sides of the same thing. When the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh, God was manifested&mdash;&ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:16). When the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh, life was manifested as well&mdash;&ldquo;And the life was manifested&rdquo; (1 John 1:2). These two verses show that the incarnation of the Lord Jesus is the manifestation and expression of God as well as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD COMING TO BE OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning the matter of God coming to be our life, we first need to see that God is life, then we need to see that God <em>Himself</em> came to be our life, and finally we need to know how God came to be our life. It is not a simple thing for God to come to be our life. First, God flowed out into the flesh; then He flowed from the flesh into the Spirit. Only in this way could He flow into us. From the Gospel of John we need to see how God came to be our life. This is the only book in the Bible which specifically speaks of God being our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Our Life by Regenerating Us</h2>
<p>In John 10:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they [man] may have life.&rdquo; This means that He desires that we have Him as life; He has come to be our life. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo;; this speaks of the very beginning and says that the Word was God. Then verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life,&rdquo; and verses 12 through 13 say, &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God...who were begotten not of...the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; Since we are begotten of God, His being our life is His begetting of us, and His begetting of us is His regenerating of us.</p>
<p>The subject of the Gospel of John is life. It begins by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...In Him was life&rdquo; (vv. 1-4). This means that the Word in the beginning was God, in whom was life. Those who receive this life are given the authority to be children of God. This authority is of life. Verse 13 goes on to say that we were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God. Whoever desires to receive God&rsquo;s life must be begotten of Him. If God did not beget us, He could not be our life.</p>
<p>The word <em>beget</em> is a verb. Just as a mother begets a child, God came to beget us. Have you ever thought that God has a deep consideration about us? All the thoughts that we have toward Him relate to His dealing, striking, and disciplining us. We have many thoughts of God dealing with us, but we do not have the thought that God came to beget us. If God did not beget us, He could never be our life. It is a great matter in the universe that God has begotten us.</p>
<p>When we think of the fact that God has begotten us, do we have a deep sense that we should jump up and praise God? Over the past twenty some years, whenever I thought of God begetting me, I would thank and praise Him. I was a piece of clay, but God begot me. This is what we see in the first chapter of John. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo;; then verses 12 through 13 say, &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God...who were begotten...of God.&rdquo; It is God who begets us. If He did not beget us, He could never become our life. This is a great matter in the universe. We were clay and mud, but we have received Him as life because of His begetting. God did not simply &ldquo;overlay&rdquo; Himself on us as gilding, nor did He merely &ldquo;coat&rdquo; us with Himself like oil. Instead, He begot us. Through His begetting, God has become our life.</p><h2 class="head2">God Regenerating Us through the Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to see how God begot us, we need to understand John 2, which tells a wonderful story about changing water into wine, about changing dead water into living wine. In this story, dead and exhaustible water became endless and inexhaustible wine; this is the changing of death into life. Then in chapter 3 the Lord spoke of regeneration. To be regenerated is to be born again following our original human birth; it is to have the life of God in addition to our human life. We have been born of our parents, but we have been born again of God&mdash;this is regeneration. How does God regenerate us? In verses 5 and 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This shows very clearly that God regenerates us with His Spirit.</p>
<p>The ultimate expression of life is the Spirit. The source of life is the Father, the expression of life is the Son, and the entering in of life is the Spirit. The Father is the first manifestation of God, the Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of God, and the Son is the manifestation of God in between. In other words, the Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of life. If the Spirit did not enter into us, life could not come into us; if the Spirit did not enter into us, the Son could not come into us; and if the Spirit did not enter into us, the Father could not come into us. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are life. Only when the Spirit enters into us can life come into us to regenerate us.</p>
<p>God becomes our life by regenerating us. How did God regenerate us? God regenerated us by His becoming the Spirit to enter into us so that we could be born of the Spirit. If we compare <em>begotten of God</em> in chapter 1 with <em>born of the Spirit</em> in chapter 3, we will receive light. Chapter 1 says that those who received the Lord were begotten of God, and chapter 3 says that they were born of the Spirit. God is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. Therefore, to be begotten of God is to be born of the Spirit; to be born of the Spirit is to be begotten of God. If God were not the Spirit, He would not be able to beget us. In order for God to beget us, He must be the Spirit. Then in chapter 4 we see that God is Spirit (v. 24). The way to read the Bible is to continually search the train of thought in the Bible. Chapter 1 speaks of being begotten of God, chapter 3 speaks of being born of the Spirit, and in chapter 4 we see that &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Regenerating Us in Our Spirit</h2>
<p>To be born of the Spirit is to be begotten of God. This means that in order for God to beget us, He must be the Spirit. If He were not the Spirit, He would not be able to beget us. God must be the Spirit in order to enter into us to be our life. From His perspective, He is the Spirit, and as such, He comes to beget us in our spirit. For example, when we receive an injection, it gets into our veins and arteries; when God comes to beget us, He comes into our spirit. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse points out directly that regeneration takes place in our spirit. Ezekiel 36 says, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you;...and I will put My Spirit within you&rdquo; (vv. 26-27). This portion also speaks of regeneration. That which is born of the Spirit (the divine Spirit) is spirit (our human spirit). The first Spirit is the Spirit of God, and the second spirit is our spirit. John 3:5 says that God begets us with His Spirit, and verse 6 shows that the Spirit begets our spirit&mdash;the Spirit of God comes to beget our human spirit.</p>
<p>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. This <em>spirit</em> is neither our soul nor our body but our human spirit. This clearly shows that God begets us through His Spirit and in our spirit. In other words, the Spirit of God enters into our spirit to beget us. Over the past two thousand years, Christianity has never seen such a revelation concerning the Spirit begetting the spirit. This statement seems simple, but actually it is quite profound. What is regeneration? Regeneration is the Spirit begetting our spirit&mdash;the Spirit of God begetting man&rsquo;s human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEGETTING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being Totally a Matter of Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit of God begets our human spirit. When God enters into our spirit through His Spirit to beget us, He enters into us to be our life. This is totally a matter of spirit. I hope that we would all have a deep impression that life is altogether a matter of spirit, a matter of the Spirit of God with our human spirit, a matter of the Spirit of God entering into our human spirit, and a matter of the union and mingling of the Spirit of God with our human spirit.</p>
<p>If we are not clear about these basic points, it will be very difficult for us to understand the fellowship of life. The fellowship of life is certainly a matter of life, but where is life? Life is in our spirit, the mingled spirit, which is the mingling of the Spirit of God with our human spirit to be our life. God begets the human spirit through His Spirit and becomes our life in the human spirit. This is the basic point spoken of in John 3:5-6.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Spirit and Those Who Worship Him<br />
Needing to Worship in Spirit</h2>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; This means that we must use our human spirit to worship and contact God. If we consider <em>begotten of God</em> in 1:13, <em>born of the Spirit</em> in 3:5, and <em>God is Spirit</em> in 4:24, we will realize that to be born of the Spirit is to be begotten of God, that it is our human spirit which is born of the Spirit, and that the Spirit of God begets our human spirit.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 verse 24 says that God is Spirit and that He desires us to worship Him&mdash;to contact Him, to fellowship with Him, and to have a relationship with Him&mdash;in spirit. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit. We cannot touch God in our mind, emotion, or will; we can touch God only in our spirit because He is Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of God Mingling with Our Spirit</h2>
<p>John 4:24 is a proof that God begets us through His Spirit and in our spirit. Because of His begetting of us, He causes us to have an absolutely subjective relationship with Him; that is, He comes to mingle Himself with us. Since God is Spirit and He desires to be mingled with man, He needs something of similar nature to Him in order to make this mingling possible. We are composed of body, soul, and spirit. He cannot mingle Himself with us in our body or soul; He can mingle Himself with us only in our spirit. Hence, He begets us in our spirit. When He begets us, He gives us a new spirit and puts His Spirit within us (Ezek. 36:26-27).</p>
<p>We should all be clear that God&rsquo;s Spirit enters into our spirit to regenerate us. We have read John 1, 3, and 4. Now if we go to chapter 20, we will see that the Lord &ldquo;breathed into&rdquo; the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This shows how God begets us and becomes our life. These two matters&mdash;life and spirit&mdash;are the line of life in the book of John.</p>
<p>The line of life indicates that the Word was in the beginning and that life was in this One who was the Word. When we contact Him, we receive authority to become the children of God; we are begotten of God. Moreover, God begets us when His Spirit enters into our spirit. God is Spirit. In order to contact Him and be joined to Him, we must be in our spirit. In order to mingle Himself with us and be our life, He must enter into our spirit through His Spirit. May these words be deeply engraved in our heart and be thoroughly apprehended in our mind so that they may shine forth as light within us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD BEING MAN&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF,<br />
NOT MAN&rsquo;S GOOD BEHAVIOR</h2>
<p>Life is God Himself, and anything that is not an outflow of God cannot be considered life. Based upon this, we should be very careful to realize that any virtue or goodness, whether humility, meekness, or patience, that is not an outflow of God, manifesting the element of God and bearing the flavor of God, is merely human behavior, not life. It may be good behavior, but it is not life. This includes even our love. If our love does not give people the feeling of the presence of God and the flavor of God, then it is merely good behavior, a human virtue. Life is God Himself. When we see some brothers and sisters who are meek, humble, loving, and forbearing, we always think that they are advanced in their growth in life. We should not think in this way; rather, we should touch these virtues with our spiritual sense and smell them according to our spiritual &ldquo;nose.&rdquo; If we cannot sense the element of God and smell the flavor of God, then only man&rsquo;s good behavior is being manifested, not life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING CHRIST, AND<br />
TO LIVE OUT LIFE BEING TO LIVE OUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>We should know that life is God Himself. All our goodness, virtues, and merits cannot substitute for God, because anything that is not of God is not life. Just as life is God Himself, life is also Christ. Anything that does not measure up to Christ is not life. Since Christ is the expression of God, He is also the expression of life. When we have life, we have God, and when we live out life, we live out God&mdash;that is, we live out Christ. All our goodness and virtues are life only if they have the flavor of God; likewise, they are life only if they have the flavor of Christ. If our goodness and virtue do not cause people to sense Christ and God, they are not life. Our walk is life only if it causes others to sense Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING OUR LIFE BY REGENERATING US</h2>
<p>Life is the Triune God Himself&mdash;the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering. The Father is the source of life, the Son is the expression of life, and the Spirit is the entering of life. The Gospel of John shows how the Triune God becomes our life. It speaks first in 1:1 of the Word, which was in the beginning, being God. He was in the beginning. Then verse 4 shows that in this Word was life, and verse 12 says that those who have received this Word have been given the authority to become children of God, and this authority is life. Verse 13 continues by saying that these ones have been begotten not of the will of man but of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2>
<p>When we put these four verses together, we see that in order for God to come to be our life, He must regenerate us. The God who was in the beginning was manifested in the Word and was manifested as the Word. We all know that words are the expression of man; all of man&rsquo;s thoughts and desires are expressed in words. The word of God is God Himself; thus, the word of God is the expression and explanation of God. Because of the word of God, He is no longer hidden. He has been manifested to us. God as the Word came to be our life, and He was manifested so that He could be our life. Once we receive him, He regenerates us so that we may receive life. This life is the authority which enables us to have a life relationship with Him and become His children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD REGENERATING US BY BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>From John 3:5 and 6 we can see that in order to be begotten of God, we must be born of the Spirit. If God were only God and not the Spirit, He would have no way to enter into us and beget us, and neither would He be able to be our life. In order to regenerate us and be our life, God must be the Spirit. Only as the Spirit can He enter into us and regenerate us. As the Word, He is manifested among us, and as the Spirit, He comes into us to beget us. If God were not the Word, He could not come among us, and if He were not the Spirit, He could not come into us. He became the Word so that He could be manifested among us, and He became the Spirit so that He could enter into us.</p>
<p>John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The first <em>Spirit</em> is the Spirit of God, and the second <em>spirit</em> is our human spirit. God&rsquo;s begetting of us is the Spirit&rsquo;s begetting in our spirit; therefore, God comes into our spirit to beget us. This can also be seen in Ezekiel 36:26, which says, &ldquo;A new spirit I will put within you.&rdquo; John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that our contact with Him must be in spirit; we must worship and touch Him in spirit. This is the light we found by following the line of life in the Bible, and this is the way to read the Bible.</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and we also have a spirit within us. As the Spirit, He comes into our spirit to regenerate us. This word is easy to speak, but it involves many verses: John 1:13, 3:5-6, and 4:24. The Word that was in the beginning was God. In order to be our life, He enters into our spirit as the Spirit to beget us; hence, all our contact with Him must be in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORDS OF GOD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>How does the Spirit of God enter into our human spirit to regenerate us? John 6:63 says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. The way the Spirit of God comes into our spirit and begets us is through the Lord&rsquo;s words. Without the Lord&rsquo;s words, the Spirit is not solid, not tangible. The Spirit may be likened to life in the human body, and the words of God to the human body itself. If a man has only life, if he has only a spirit and a soul but not a body, people will not be able to contact and touch him. Only when the spirit and soul have a body can they become solid, can they contact the physical world, and can they be touched by the physical world.</p>
<p>Similarly, without the words of God, the Spirit of God is without a &ldquo;body,&rdquo; so it is hard for man to touch Him. Hence, in consideration of our weakness and in order that we may touch the Holy Spirit in a solid way, God gives us the Word. The words of God are the embodiment of the Spirit of God and the hiding place of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit hides Himself in the words of God; in this way, the Holy Spirit is embodied in a solid form. With the words of God, we can easily touch the Spirit and practically experience the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST THE WORD, THEN THE SPIRIT, AND THEN LIFE</h2>
<p>The Spirit of God cannot be separated from the words of God, just as the spirit and soul of a person cannot be separated from his body. Thus, when a person receives the words of God, the Spirit in the words enters into him. When we receive the words of God, the Spirit enters into us. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This means that when we touch His words, we touch the Spirit, and when we touch the Spirit, we receive life. This sequence cannot be reversed: first there is the Word, then the Spirit, and then life&mdash;the Word, the Spirit, and life. It is not that we have life and then the Spirit, but when we have the Spirit, we have life because the Spirit is life and the Spirit is in the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORDS BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God regenerates us in our spirit, but we touch God as the Spirit through His words. If a person has only a spirit and soul but not a body, there will be no way to touch him. In the same way, if God were merely the Spirit, it would be difficult for us to touch Him; however, once we enter into His words, it is easy for us to touch the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s words are the embodiment of the Spirit. Once we touch and receive His words, we touch and receive the Spirit because the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit.</p>
<p>We may use an illustration. There are batteries in a flashlight, and there is electricity in the batteries. Those who make batteries transmit electricity into the batteries, and thus, the electricity is embodied. When we put the batteries inside the flashlight, electricity automatically gets into the flashlight. The words of God are the batteries of the Spirit of God, and the Spirit in the words of God is like the electricity in the batteries, which is easy for us to receive. For example, John 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; Such a word can easily touch people. As long as they open their heart and receive this word, the Spirit in this word will enter into them. The Spirit enters into everyone who receives this word. There are many words of God in the Bible, and as long as men open their heart to receive these words, the Spirit will enter into them. It does not matter whether these words are words of the gospel. As long as they are God&rsquo;s words and as long as men open their heart to receive them, the Spirit will enter into them, because the Spirit is in the words. The Spirit comes with the words; as long as men receive the words, the Spirit enters into them. When this Spirit enters into the human spirit, the issue is life. &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REGENERATING SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>When we come to John 7, we see that the Spirit who enters into man will flow out of man&rsquo;s innermost being as rivers of living water (vv. 37-39). Moreover, this Spirit was there only after Christ was glorified. Christ&rsquo;s glorification is His resurrection. In other words, the Spirit spoken of in John 7 is the Spirit of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Resurrection is life, and without life, there is no resurrection. The Spirit of resurrection is the Spirit of life. The Spirit of God enters into us in the words of God so that we may receive life. He as the Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection. Since He is the Spirit of resurrection, once He enters into us, His resurrection life regenerates us.</p>
<p>Being regenerated, receiving life, and being resurrected are three different ways of saying the same thing. In the New Testament, being made alive, receiving life, and being regenerated are seemingly three different things, but they are actually the same thing, because the Spirit who enters into us to enliven us, to make us alive, through the words of God is the Spirit of resurrection, the Spirit of life. Today in the New Testament age whoever receives the words of God into him receives the Spirit of the New Testament, the Spirit of resurrection, not the Spirit of the Old Testament. Before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and glorification, this Spirit was not yet. In the age of the Old Testament, the Spirit of God came upon men in order for them to receive power or certain kinds of inspiration, but they could not receive God&rsquo;s life. It was not until the age of the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was resurrected and glorified, that the Spirit of resurrection came into being. The Spirit of resurrection who enters into us through the words of God causes us to receive the life of God so that we may be made alive and regenerated, rather than just receiving some inspiration and power.</p>
<p>John 6 says that the Spirit enters into us through the Lord&rsquo;s words, and chapter 7 says that the Spirit as the Spirit of resurrection enters into us. When we receive the words of God, the Spirit comes into us. When the Spirit comes into us, we are resurrected and made alive. Ephesians 2 says that God made us alive when we were dead in our offenses and sins (vv. 1, 5). We are made alive because the Spirit of resurrection in John 7 has entered into us. The Spirit enters into us through the words of God. Moreover, the Spirit who enters into us is the Spirit of resurrection, and as such, He enlivens our deadened spirit. This is what John 6 and 7 show.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD AS THE SEED OF LIFE REGENERATING MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the word of the Lord, as the seed of life, contains the life of God (1 Pet. 1:23). A seed is something tangible, yet it contains life, which is intangible. Consider, for example, a flower seed. We can see the seed but not its life; nevertheless, life is hidden in the seed. Like a seed, the word of the Lord is tangible, but within it is the intangible life of God; wherever it is sown, it will blossom.</p>
<p>The Bible likens the heart of man to a field (Matt. 13:3, 8). When the word of God, which can be compared to a seed, is sown into the field of the heart of man, the life of God will grow. This growth is God&rsquo;s regeneration of man. First Peter 1:23 says, &ldquo;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of...the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; We have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God. The word of God has been spread for many centuries both in the East and in the West, and as long as it is sown into the field of the heart of man, a life which is intangible yet real will grow forth. This is God&rsquo;s regeneration of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SPOKEN WORDS TO US<br />
BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>John 6:63 says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Although life is hidden in the Lord&rsquo;s words, the Spirit must be in the words in order for the words to have life. Without the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, the Lord&rsquo;s words are without life; the Lord&rsquo;s words must have the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit to have the Lord&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s life is with His Spirit, and His Spirit is in His words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to be clear that the Spirit does not follow life but rather that life follows the Spirit. Life is within the Spirit; we can touch life only through the Spirit. We can know life only when we know the Spirit, and we can touch life only when we touch the Spirit. What is life, and how can we touch life? Life is the Spirit. To touch the Spirit is to touch life, and to know the Spirit is to know life. For us to learn the lesson of the fellowship of life, we must touch the matter of the Spirit and know the Spirit based on a foundation of the knowledge of life. Otherwise, we will have no way to know the matter of life and no way to experience the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING DEPENDENT ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks about God becoming flesh to be our life. If we truly know the Gospel of John, we will see that it begins with life. Then it turns from life to the Spirit in chapter 3, and in chapter 20, on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He came into the midst of the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This shows that where the Spirit is, there is life; without the Spirit, there is no life.</p>
<p>John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life,&rdquo; showing that for God to be man&rsquo;s life is for Him to regenerate man (vv. 12-13). God being man&rsquo;s life to regenerate him is a matter in the Spirit. Hence, in chapter 3 the focus turns from life to the Spirit. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit&rdquo;; then verses 15 and 16 say that those who are born of the Spirit have the eternal life of God. Here we see life and the Spirit. In chapter 4 the Lord spoke with the Samaritan woman about the matter of the living water which issues from the eternal life. The Lord particularly said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (v. 24). Here the Lord clearly turned from life to the Spirit. To touch life by drinking the living water of life, one must contact and worship God, who is Spirit, by being in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT, IN RESURRECTION, BECOMING<br />
RIVERS OF LIVING WATER FLOWING OUT OF MAN</h2>
<p>In 6:63, the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Obviously, life is in the Spirit. Where the Spirit is, there is life. In 7:38 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The rivers are the flowing of the Spirit of the resurrected Christ from within man. In other words, after Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and glorification, the Spirit of life, the Spirit of resurrection, enters into man and becomes rivers of living water flowing out of man. Therefore, we cannot separate life from the Spirit; life is with the Spirit. When we know the Spirit, we know life. So far, we have seen four main points: life, the Spirit, the Word, and resurrection. The Gospel of John speaks first of life, then turns from life to the Spirit, and then goes on to say that the Spirit is in the word and that, in resurrection, this Spirit becomes rivers of living water flowing out of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1"><em>LOGOS</em> BEING PROCESSED TO BECOME <em>RHEMA</em></h2>
<p>John 1 starts with &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; The Greek term for <em>Word</em> here is <em>logos,</em> which can be likened to &ldquo;great words,&rdquo; but the Greek term for <em>words</em> in chapter 6 is <em>rhema,</em> which can be likened to &ldquo;small words.&rdquo; <em>Logos</em> may be likened to a lamb, and <em>rhema</em> to a small piece of meat cut off from the lamb. We cannot eat the lamb in its entirety, but we can cut the lamb into small pieces and cook them for eating. As a whole lamb, the Word who became flesh in chapter 1 is slaughtered and cut in chapter 6. In verses 50 and 51 the Lord said that He is the bread which came down out of heaven, indicating that He is man&rsquo;s food. In verse 55 He also said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo; The separation of blood from the flesh signifies death, indicating that there is a process of being slain. If the Lord was a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; lamb, there would be no way for Him to be eaten by man; He had to be slain and processed in order to be eaten by man to become man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>When the Lord told the Jews, &ldquo;My flesh is true food...he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (vv. 55, 57), they were puzzled. They wondered how the Lord could give His flesh for man to eat and how man could have life by eating His flesh. The answer is in verse 63: &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Lord was referring to the fact that His words, <em>rhema,</em> are spirit and that it is the Spirit who gives life. The Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and are life. Hence, in this chapter the Lord&rsquo;s words can be compared to &ldquo;meat&rdquo; cut into small pieces for eating; hence, they are &ldquo;small words,&rdquo; <em>rhema,</em> which are different from the &ldquo;great words,&rdquo; <em>logos,</em> in chapter 1. Through the process of the Lord&rsquo;s death, <em>logos</em> became <em>rhema.</em> A complete lamb became small pieces of meat, and the great words became small words. In this way He could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD IN THE FLESH<br />
BECOMING THE SPIRIT TO LIVE IN US</h2>
<p>The Lord is the Word who was in the beginning (1:1). As the Lamb of God (v. 29), He passed through a process to be food to man (6:51) that man might eat Him and receive Him. After a lamb has been slain and eaten, it gets into us. After the lamb has been eaten, however, is it gone? No! Instead, the lamb enters into us, becomes us, and is now &ldquo;living&rdquo; in us. The lamb has become us and is living in us to be our life; the lamb is not gone. What has become life in us? In spiritual terms, it is resurrection. Death is a process through which the lamb passed; the resurrected lamb is within us.</p>
<p>In John 12:24, the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; For the grain of wheat to bear much fruit is for it to bring forth many grains, that is, for it to enter into many grains. The Gospel of John is a record of how the God who was in the beginning became flesh, and how through being slain, He became edible &ldquo;meat&rdquo; for us who believe in Him to eat and digest so that He can be with us forever and never leave us again. This is called resurrection. Resurrection is the Lord Himself entering into us and living in us. This is the reason the Gospel of John has no record of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension. It contains a record only of His becoming flesh, passing through death, and making a turn to come into us and live in us. This is resurrection.</p>
<p>How did the Lord enter into us? How did He make this turn and come into us? In the Gospel of John He made several turns. The first turn is in chapter 1: the Word became flesh to bring God into man. The second turn is in chapter 14: the Lord in the flesh became the Spirit through death and resurrection. We need to remember that resurrection is the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit is resurrection. In chapter 7 the Lord linked resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and glorification: &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&rdquo; (v. 39). Then in chapter 14 the Lord explained even more clearly how He became the Spirit. This is a great turn in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>In chapter 14 the Lord spoke of His transfiguration from the flesh into the Spirit. The Lord told His disciples that He would go, and this troubled them (vv. 1-2). His going refers to His death. However, the Lord also said, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you&rdquo; (v. 18). His coming to us refers to His resurrection. There is no mention of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension and His second coming in John 14. Brethren teachers, even though they are rich in truth, interpret <em>coming</em> in chapter 14 as being related to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming; this is incorrect. In chapter 14 <em>going</em> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s death, and <em>coming</em> refers to His resurrection. His going and coming are His death and resurrection. He went into death in the flesh and came back in resurrection as the Spirit. Through His going and coming, which is His death and resurrection, He became the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the beginning the Lord&rsquo;s life was intangible, but one day, the Word, who was in the beginning, became flesh and tabernacled among us. When the Lord Jesus was with the twelve disciples, He was tabernacling among them. Then in chapter 14 He spoke of His going and coming, which refer to His death and resurrection. Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Chapter 1 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. Chapter 14 says that when the Spirit of reality comes, He will abide with us and be in us; this abiding is an eternal abiding. His becoming the Spirit, referred to in chapter 14, transpired in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIX ISSUES OF THE LORD ENTERING INTO US<br />
IN RESURRECTION AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There are at least six issues of the Lord&rsquo;s entering into us as the Spirit. First, He enters into us to abide with us forever (v. 16). Second, He causes us to live as Christ lives; that is, He causes Christ to live in us (v. 17). Third, He reminds us of the things which the Lord said; that is, He speaks and explains Christ to us inwardly (v. 26). This means that the Christ in the four Gospels is being spoken of and explained to us by Himself as the Spirit in us. These points are seen in chapter 14. Fourth, the Spirit testifies in us concerning Christ; this is seen in chapter 15 verse 26.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Spirit in us guides us into all the reality; this is seen in chapter 16. To guide us into all the reality is to guide us into all the reality of God that is in Christ (v. 13). Sixth, the Spirit glorifies Christ in us so that Christ may have the preeminence in us, just as He has the preeminence in the universe; this is seen in chapter 17. The Spirit shows how Christ inherits all things in the universe and all that is of God, and in the same way, Christ in us should gain all that is of us. His entering into us has at least these six issues which are the content of life.</p>
<p>In summary, from the Gospel of John we see that the Lord in us is life, that He became the Spirit so that He can live in us. We see that the Spirit speaks Christ to us, explaining to us the Christ who is recorded in the four Gospels. Moreover, the Spirit testifies in us concerning Christ, guides us into all the reality, and glorifies Christ in us. All these items are the functions of life, and they are also the resurrected Christ as the content of life in us. I hope that all of us will enter into and muse on these messages carefully. If we would know the content of life, we need to know these six points; nearly all the contents of life can be found in these six points.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
CONVICTING MAN CONCERNING SIN, CONCERNING RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND CONCERNING JUDGMENT</h2>
<p>When the Spirit of resurrection enters into man, He convicts man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment (16:8). <em>Concerning sin</em> is related to Adam, <em>concerning righteousness</em> is related to Christ, and <em>concerning judgment</em> is related to Satan. The Holy Spirit shows man his sinful condition in Adam, and then He shows man that he can be justified in Christ. Man can be justified in Christ because Christ died and resurrected. Without being justified in Christ by being transferred into Him, a sinful man in Adam will certainly follow Satan and come under the judgment of God. This is because the ruler of this world, Satan, has been judged (v. 11).</p>
<p>The ruler of this world has been judged, and all those who follow him will be judged. If men are willing to be Satan&rsquo;s people and follow him, they will be judged with him. Matthew 25:41 says that the eternal fire is prepared for Satan and his angels, not for men. We were sinners in Adam, but we can be transferred into Christ and be justified rather than following Satan and coming under God&rsquo;s judgment. The Holy Spirit convicts us inwardly concerning these three points so that we may repent and confess our sins for our regeneration. When we are regenerated, we are saved and made alive from within, and there are these six issues of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John shows that Christ in the flesh passed through death and resurrection, and in resurrection He became the Spirit to enter into us to be our life. In the beginning, the Spirit shows our condition in Adam, and then He shows the result we have in Christ and the end of those who follow Satan, thereby convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment so that we may repent and confess our sins. In this way, the Spirit enters into us and grants these six issues. These six issues are the story of life in us. First, the Spirit in us is our life; second, Christ lives in us; third, the Spirit in us explains and speaks Christ to us; fourth, the Spirit in us testifies concerning Christ; fifth, the Spirit guides us into all the reality of God that is in Christ; and sixth, the Spirit glorifies Christ in us so that Christ may have the preeminence in us and possess all that is ours. This is the story of life in us after our regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING LIFE IN A PROPER WAY</h2>
<p>We frequently speak of life, but what exactly is life? When someone walks slowly and is polite and gentle, do we say that this is life? When someone looks stern and angry, do we say that this is not life? No, we cannot say this; rather, we must consider these six issues. Life is Christ living in us, and the Spirit is explaining and speaking Christ in us, testifying to us concerning Christ, guiding us into the reality of God in Christ so that He may have the ground and everything in us, and enthroning Christ in us so that He may be glorified. This is stated repeatedly in John 14 through 17. This is life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF LIFE BECOMING<br />
OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>From John 1 through 17 we see two great turns of the Lord. One is that He became flesh to come into the midst of men; the other is that He became the Spirit through death and resurrection to enter into men, thereby producing these six issues in us. The purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 is to ask God to fulfill the story of life spoken of in the previous chapters. In chapter 18 the Lord was betrayed and judged, in chapter 19 He died and was buried, and in chapter 20 He was resurrected. In resurrection He came into the midst of the disciples, breathed into them, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). The disciples were surprised that the Lord could enter into the room when all the doors were shut. In that small room there was the story of life. Because the Lord was resurrected and He became the Spirit, the disciples could receive Him as easily as breathing. The story of the entire Gospel of John is hidden in the Holy Spirit whom the Lord breathed into the disciples. If we would simply inhale Him as in breathing, He would immediately come into us to be our life; in resurrection, He becomes so available.</p>
<p>In chapter 20 the Lord&rsquo;s breathing into the disciples seems to be a small matter; actually, it is a great matter. This breath is the holy breath, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is too great a thing. The story of life and all spiritual reality are in the Spirit, and the Spirit, like air, is always available to us. Once we breathe in the Holy Spirit, we have all the stories of life, such as the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation and His death and resurrection. Incarnation brought God into man, and death and resurrection brought man into God. All the content of life, the aspects of life, and the spiritual stories in John 1 through 20 are included in the Holy Spirit in chapter 20.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of resurrection, is the issue of the two great steps taken by the Lord: His incarnation and His death and resurrection. The Spirit of resurrection contains all of His stories of life. All we have to do is breathe Him in, pray to Him, change our concept, repent, confess our sins, and worship Him, and we will instantly obtain Him. We simply need to have a small amount of spiritual breathing, and the Holy Spirit will come into us immediately. All the content of the story of life is in the Holy Spirit and also in our spirit. Through the Spirit&rsquo;s begetting our spirit, the Spirit with all His riches and the fullness of life can easily enter into our spirit and dwell in us as our supply and reality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTIONS OF<br />
THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;WORD&rdquo; IN JOHN 1 AND &ldquo;WORDS&rdquo; IN JOHN 6</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and 6:63 says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Both verses speak of the word. Chapter 1 speaks of the Word that was in the beginning, and chapter 6 speaks of the words which the Lord has spoken to us. What is the difference between the two? How does the Word in chapter 1 become words in chapter 6? Is there a difference in their function? This matter surely requires much study.</p>
<h2 class="head2"><em>Logos</em> and <em>Rhema</em></h2>
<p>John 1 starts with &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then chapter 6 says that the words the Lord speaks are spirit and life. In chapter 1 the Word is God Himself, and in chapter 6 the words are something that comes out from God. The Word in chapter 1 is a complete entity; however, the words in chapter 6 are in smaller parts. We can say that <em>Word, logos,</em> in chapter 1 denotes &ldquo;great words,&rdquo; like an entire lamb, but <em>words, rhema,</em> in chapter 6 denotes &ldquo;small words,&rdquo; like many pieces of meat cut from the lamb. This illustration is very expressive. It shows that the Word in chapter 1 is the Lord Himself and that the words in chapter 6 are something that comes out from the Lord. This is the difference between the two.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being in Christ and Christ Becoming the Spirit</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh&rdquo;; <em>flesh</em> refers to Christ. This means that the &ldquo;great words&rdquo; in chapter 1 refer to God who became flesh, that is, God in Christ. On the one hand, the Word is God; on the other hand, it is Christ. In chapter 6 Christ became the Spirit through death and resurrection to be &ldquo;small words&rdquo; for us to receive. Hence, the words in chapter 6 are Christ who has become the Spirit; they are Christ on the one hand and the Spirit on the other.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Word in Chapter 1<br />
Being Different from<br />
That of the Words in Chapter 6</h2>
<p>The great Word in chapter 1 is God manifested among us as life, but He still cannot enter into us to be our life. When He becomes the small words in chapter 6, He enters into us as life. Here we see the function of the Word and the words: the former manifests Him among us as life, and the latter enters into us as life. A whole lamb can only be displayed among us, but it cannot be eaten. Only when a lamb is slaughtered and processed can it be cut into many pieces to eat. In chapter 6 this &ldquo;meat&rdquo; is placed before us for our enjoyment. The &ldquo;great Word&rdquo; is displayed for us to see in chapter 1, but the &ldquo;small words&rdquo; are for us to eat and enjoy in chapter 6.</p>
<p>The Lamb we see on display outside of us has become &ldquo;meat&rdquo; on the table for our enjoyment; these are the different functions of the word. The Word in chapter 1, through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, has entered into resurrection to become words in chapter 6 which can be eaten and received by us and can enter into us to be our life and supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Passing through Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>How do we know that the words spoken of in chapter 6 have passed through death and resurrection? According to 6:55, the Lord said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo; The separation of blood and flesh indicates death. In verse 63 the Lord also said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Lord becoming the Spirit indicates resurrection. Instead of merely reading the black and white letters in the Bible, we need to find their spiritual significance. The Lord can enter into us to be our enjoyment and life because He has passed through death and resurrection, experiencing the separation of blood and flesh. He not only has been manifested among us as life; now He can be eaten, received, and digested by us to become life in us.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John there are two great turns. The first great turn is the Word becoming flesh, and the second is the Lord becoming the Spirit through death and resurrection; hence, death and resurrection is a great turn. John 14 speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s going and coming. The Lord&rsquo;s going is His death, and His coming is His resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s coming after His resurrection is His coming as the Spirit into us. In His death He was crucified in the flesh, and in His resurrection He became the Spirit. As the Spirit, the Lord can come into us.</p>
<p>In 14:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; The preceding verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; This shows that the Lord comes as the Spirit to be in us. Then verse 20 continues, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; We know that the two references to <em>in</em> refer to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection since He also said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live&rdquo; (v. 19). Both instances of <em>live</em> refer to His resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord was referring to His resurrection when He spoke these words in 14:19-20; in particular, the phrase <em>in that day</em> in verse 20 refers to the day of resurrection. In verse 19 He said, &ldquo;Because I live [implying resurrection], you also shall live.&rdquo; He spoke of us living because as the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; He is living in us. The Lord lives in us so that we may live; therefore, <em>because I live, you also shall live</em> is a matter of resurrection. Verse 20 continues, &ldquo;You will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; After resurrection, He can come into us instantly. Verses 16 and 17 show that in His resurrection He became the Spirit to enter into us. This is the reason we say that the Lord as the Word in chapter 1 became flesh and was manifested among us but that He had not yet entered into us. It is not until chapter 14, when He spoke of passing through death and resurrection and becoming the Spirit, that we can see how He can enter into us.</p>
<p>When the Lord was manifested, He was shown and displayed, but He could not be enjoyed by us because He had not yet become our life. It is only after He enters into us that He can become our life. Then it is possible to say that because He lives, we also shall live. He has made it possible for us to also live with Him. It is because He lives in us that we also can live with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection. This Spirit includes God, Christ, incarnation, death, resurrection, and humanity in resurrection; hence, the Spirit of resurrection is an aggregate Spirit. In other words, in the Spirit of resurrection are God, Christ, incarnation, death, resurrection, and humanity in resurrection. This is to say that the Spirit of resurrection is the aggregate of God, Christ, and all that the Triune God has passed through, attained, and accomplished. Today in the New Testament age this is the Spirit who has entered into us. According to John 14 through 17 this Spirit has at least six functions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being with Us as the Indwelling Spirit</h2>
<p>John 14:16 shows that the Comforter, whom the Father would give to us, is the Spirit of resurrection who would live in us and be with us forever. Thus, the Spirit of resurrection is also the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit. All the guidance, help, shining, and strength that the Spirit gives us does not come from outside but from within; thus, He is the indwelling Spirit. We should not expect the Spirit to grant us power outwardly. Today the Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection, the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit who lives in us. His presence with us is inward, and the strength, shining, guidance, and comfort He gives are inward. All that He gives us and does for us comes from within. The Spirit&rsquo;s first function is to indwell us and to be with us inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For Christ to Live in Us</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality abides with us and shall be in us. This means that the Spirit of resurrection is for Christ to live in us. The Spirit of resurrection is Christ in another form; therefore, when the Spirit is in us, Christ is living in us. This is carried out by God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Explaining Christ to Us</h2>
<p>Verse 26 shows that the Spirit in us explains Christ to us. We know Christ not only through the Bible outwardly but also through the sense of the Spirit inwardly. The Spirit in us explains Christ to us. Many stories about the Lord Jesus cannot be understood by unbelievers or comprehended by those who read the Bible merely with their eyes. It is the Spirit who explains Christ to us, especially concerning how Christ was God who became flesh, how He was a man, how He became our Savior, how He is the King, and how He is the Most High God. The Spirit explains all that Christ is and has and all the words He spoke on earth. This is the emphasis of John 14:21-31.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Testifying to Us concerning Christ</h2>
<p>Chapter 15 shows that the Spirit in us testifies concerning Christ; this is related to the preceding point. The Spirit explains Christ to us and testifies concerning Christ. These are actually two related matters; however, there is still a difference. Everything concerning Christ&mdash;what He was, what He did, and what He said&mdash;is made clear to us by the Spirit in this third function. The emphasis on the Spirit&rsquo;s function in regard to testifying concerning Christ is related to what Christ has obtained and attained, how He has the first place, how He was glorified, and how He was exalted by the Father and made Lord and Christ; all these matters are testified to us by the Spirit.</p>
<p>We know that the Christ who was on earth is now in heaven, that the lowly Christ is now glorified, and that the despised Jesus is now exalted by God and made Lord and Christ, because the Spirit testifies to us concerning these things. The Spirit&rsquo;s explanation of Christ to us is regarding what He did, what He said, and what He was in the past, but the Spirit&rsquo;s testifying to us concerning Christ is regarding the high and glorious position which He attained and obtained after His death and resurrection. All these things concerning Christ&mdash;how He was glorified, how He was exalted by God, how He ascended to heaven and was made Lord and Christ, and how He is above all&mdash;are testified to us by the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Guiding Us into All the Reality</h2>
<p>The Spirit in us makes all that God is in Christ real to us; this is shown in chapter 16&mdash;God in Christ has come to be everything to us. If we did not have God in Christ as everything to us, we would still be void and empty inwardly. However, if we have God in Christ as everything to us, we will be full of reality inwardly. God in Christ is everything to us, and this matter is made real to us by the Spirit. For example, in the matter of God being our life, it is the Spirit who becomes the reality of this life, and in the matter of God being our power, it is the Spirit who makes this power real to us. If we do not have the Spirit of resurrection in us, God as life would only be terminology, mere sayings to us, but not a reality. It is the Spirit of resurrection in us who makes the matter of God coming to be our life real to us. God coming to be our life, power, and comfort is God in Christ coming to be everything to us. Without the Spirit of resurrection entering into us, all these matters would be empty terminology. All these matters can become our inward reality and be received, touched, and enjoyed by us because the Spirit of resurrection has accomplished these things in us. Once the Spirit of resurrection enters into us, He makes all that God is in Christ real to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For Christ to Have the Preeminence in Us</h2>
<p>The Spirit of resurrection in us glorifies Christ so that He may always have the preeminence in our being, so that He may have the full ground in us, and so that everything of ours will be in submission under His authority. This is revealed in chapter 17.</p>
<p>The totality of these six points is the work that the Spirit of resurrection does in us, and this is also the content of life. When we speak of life, the story of this life is contained in these six points. The sum total of these six points is the content of the story of life in us. The full story of this life within us, the life of God, is contained in these six points. In brief, the story of life in us is for us to know Christ, see Christ, experience Christ, and glorify Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT CAUSING MAN TO REPENT OF SIN<br />
AND BE REGENERATED</h2>
<p>Before the Spirit enters into us to carry out these six things, He must first do one thing. John 16:8 shows that the Spirit causes man to repent, to rebuke himself, and to confess his sin. Verses 9 and 11 say, &ldquo;Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father;...and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&rdquo; Concerning sin, the Spirit shows people that they will be condemned if they remain in Adam and do not believe in the Lord. Concerning righteousness, the Spirit shows people that they can be justified by believing in Christ because God has accomplished redemption. Concerning judgment, the Spirit shows people that they will be judged in the future if they follow Satan because Satan has been judged by God.</p>
<p>When people see these matters concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, they are convicted to repent and receive the Savior. Then the Spirit enters into them to regenerate them, and from this time onward, the Spirit carries out these six things continuously within them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE STORY OF LIFE BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>At the end of the Gospel of John, on the first day of the week, the Lord in His resurrected body came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (20:22). This may be considered the last thing spoken of in the Gospel of John. The entire Gospel of John ends here: the incarnated Christ has been transfigured into the Spirit, becoming the Spirit of resurrection to enter into our spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospel of John there is a story of the Spirit. John begins with life and ends with the Spirit. From this we can see that the story of life is in the Spirit. In order to know life, we need to know the Spirit; if we do not know the Spirit, we cannot touch life. Today in the church life, many people know biblical teachings but do not know the Spirit. If we ask them to give some teachings, many can, but if we ask them to touch the Spirit, they cannot. Without even speaking of the Christians who are not among us, many saints who meet with us have a shallow and limited knowledge of the Spirit. Consequently, few saints live in the fellowship of life. This shows that it is very difficult to touch life without knowing the Spirit. Without touching life, it is not possible to live in the fellowship of life. If we would practice living in the fellowship of life, we must know the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks especially of God being our life and emphasizes the Spirit, because life can be received, experienced, and enjoyed by man only in the Spirit. Since the Spirit is life, we cannot know life unless we touch the Spirit. In the Gospel of John we can see that life and the Spirit, the Spirit and life, are one; they are joined together and cannot be separated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to see the story of the Spirit, we must first know the Spirit. There are two portions in the Gospel of John which speak of the Spirit and the spirit: the first Spirit is the Spirit of God, and the second spirit is our human spirit. These two are involved in the Spirit begetting our spirit. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The first <em>Spirit</em> in this verse refers to the Spirit on God&rsquo;s side, and the second <em>spirit</em> refers to the spirit on man&rsquo;s side. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; The first <em>Spirit</em> in this verse refers to the Spirit on God&rsquo;s side, and the second <em>spirit</em> refers to the spirit on man&rsquo;s side. This verse also speaks of two spirits.</p>
<p>The Spirit spoken of in Romans 8:16 is a mingled spirit, that is, the Spirit on God&rsquo;s side and the spirit on man&rsquo;s side mingled as one. It is hard to say whether the spirit in Romans 8 is the Spirit of God or the spirit of man because it is the Spirit of God mingled with the spirit of man to be one spirit. Hence, when we focus on the story of the spirit, we should not focus merely on the Spirit of God or the spirit of man. We should not focus on only one aspect of the spirit but on the one spirit from two viewpoints; that is, we must focus on the spirit which is the mingling of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO EXPERIENCE LIFE BEING<br />
TO EXPERIENCE GOD, CHRIST, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To experience life is to experience God, which is to experience Christ and the Spirit. Why do we say that to experience God, Christ, and the Spirit is to experience life? God is life, so to experience God is to experience life. Christ is life, so to experience Christ is to experience life. The Spirit is life, so to experience the Spirit is to experience life. God, Christ, and the Spirit are life.</p>
<p>What is the result of experiencing God, Christ, and the Spirit? Experiencing God causes us to touch God inwardly; therefore, to experience God is to touch God. To experience Christ is to experience His living in us and ultimately His being formed in us. When the element of Christ increases in us, He will be formed in us and expressed through us. Then we will have the stature of the fullness of Christ, and in the end, we will be transformed into His image. To experience the Spirit is to experience God in Christ as our life; in other words, it is to experience the Spirit operating in us.</p>
<p>To experience God is to touch God inwardly and to be touched by God. To experience Christ, in brief, is to experience Christ living in us. To experience the Spirit is to experience God in Christ as our life, that is, to experience the Spirit operating in us. This is the experience of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS GAINED THROUGH REGENERATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>There are two reasons that man must be regenerated: one reason relates to a higher purpose, and the other to a lower. The lower purpose is that our human life is wicked and corrupt. It cannot be changed or improved; consequently, we need another life. The higher purpose is that even if our human life were good, it still would be related merely to the created life rather than to the uncreated life of God. In order to have the uncreated life of God, we must be born again. Although this may not be considered a profound truth, it is a basic and simple truth.</p>
<p>We must be regenerated because we do not have the life of God; only by regeneration can we have the uncreated, eternal life of God. We must have the eternal life of God because it is God&rsquo;s intention to make us the same as He is with His image and likeness. In order to make us the same as He is, God must put His life in us. If He did not put His life in us, how could we be like Him? In order to be like Him, we must have His life. In order to have His life, we must be regenerated. This is the higher purpose of regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Regeneration means to be born again, to be born of God, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to our human life. When God puts His life in us in addition to our human life, this is called regeneration. Therefore, the meaning of regeneration is to be born again of God; to be regenerated is to obtain the life of God in addition to our original human life. Our apprehension of this spiritual truth must be clear, and when we speak of regeneration, we must make this point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>There are three results of regeneration. First, regeneration causes us to become the children of God; second, it makes us the new creation; and third, it causes us to be in union with God, to be joined to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THAT WHICH IS GAINED<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Regeneration also causes us to gain seven things: the life of God, the law of life, a new heart, a new spirit, the Spirit, Christ, and the Triune God. Through regeneration, we receive the life of God, and the law of life comes with this life. Then God gives us a new heart and a new spirit. Then the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is also in us. When we receive the Spirit, we receive Christ and God because God is in Christ, and Christ has become the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are regenerated, the life of God enters into us. In this life there is a law&mdash;the law of life. Moreover, when the life of God enters into us, it adjusts our heart so that it becomes a new heart and adjusts our spirit so that it becomes a new spirit. His Spirit indwells us and causes us to obtain the Spirit. Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, and God is in Christ, we also obtain Christ and God. This clearly shows what we gain through regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Life of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Life of God Being the Content of God,<br />
Which Is God Himself</h2>
<p>Regeneration causes us to have the life of God. In regeneration the main thing that the Spirit of God does is to put the life of God into us. The life of God is the content of God, that is, God Himself. All that is in God and all that God is are in the life of God. All the fullness of the Godhead, every facet of God, is included in this life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All That God Is and Does Being in His Life</h2>
<p>The essence of every living thing is contained in its life. All its inward capabilities and functions issue from its life, and all its outward activities and expressions also originate from its life. This shows that there is a capability, a function, with life, and out from this life there is an activity, an expression. A living is a reflection of life. One&rsquo;s being is determined by its life. This is an evident principle with every living thing.</p>
<p>God has the highest life; everything that He is, is in His life. God is truth, holiness, light, and love; these are not things that He does. Truth, holiness, light, and love are not God&rsquo;s work, but instead are God&rsquo;s nature. God is truth, holiness, light, and love; these are derived from His life. Furthermore, whatever He does and expresses, whether it is goodness, righteousness, kindness, or forgiveness, is also derived from His life. Truth, holiness, light, and love are what God is in His inward nature; goodness, righteousness, kindness, and forgiveness are what God does in His outward expression.</p><h2 class="head3">The Life of God in Man Enabling Man<br />
to Be like God and Live Out God</h2>
<p>Truth, holiness, light, and love are divine capabilities and functions and are manifested in divine acts and expressions outwardly, which are goodness, righteousness, kindness, and forgiveness. The reason He is such a God is that He has such a life. Hence, His being God rests in His life. In other words, He is such a God with these capabilities and functions inwardly and these acts and expressions outwardly because He has such a life.</p>
<p>The fullness of the Godhead and the nature of God Himself are contained in the life of God because the life of God is the content of God. Therefore, when we receive the life of God, we receive the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9-10) and the nature of God (2 Pet. 1:3-4). When we receive this life, we receive all that God has and all that God is because all that God has and all that God is are in the life of God. The life of God enables us to have the same divine capabilities and functions in us. God&rsquo;s life enables us to be what God is and do what God does, which means that we can be like God and live out God because all that God is and does come from His life.</p>
<p>With the life of God in us, we have all the capabilities and functions that are in God&rsquo;s life. Because we have the life of God in us, we can be what God is and do what God does. In God there is the capability of holiness and the function of light; therefore, we also have the capability of holiness and the function of light in us. Just as God can live out His holiness and shine forth His light, we can live out the holiness of God and shine forth His light because the life of God is in us. God is love, and His ways are righteous; consequently, God&rsquo;s love and righteous ways can be ours because the life of God is in us. We can love according to God&rsquo;s love and be righteous according to His righteousness. Thus, we can be like God and live out God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Life of God Being the Great Power<br />
That Resurrected the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>The life of God is the great power that resurrected the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was resurrected, He cast off death and overcame death. Death is very strong (S. S. 8:6); in the universe, besides God and the life of God, there is nothing stronger than death. When the Lord Jesus entered into death, all of its power tried to hold Him, but He broke through the holding power of death and arose (Acts 2:24). The Lord arose because the powerful life of God was in Him. The great power of God&rsquo;s life enabled the Lord to break through the mighty holding power of death. Regeneration gives us the great and powerful life of God. Just as God overcame death, this great and powerful life is the power of resurrection that enables us to cast off death and overcome all that belongs to death.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that God has two kinds of power: one is the great power of creation, and the other is the great power of resurrection. God&rsquo;s great power of creation calls things not being as being, and His great power of resurrection gives life to the dead. This is what Abraham believed (Rom. 4:17). God&rsquo;s great power of creation, resting in the hand of God, is able to create all things for man, but God&rsquo;s great power of resurrection rests in the life of God. One involves the hand of creation, and the other involves the resurrection life, which is also the life of God. This great power of resurrection is the life of God, which enables us to be delivered from all the dead things which are outside of God and thus live out God Himself.</p>
<p>The life of God that we receive through regeneration is the great resurrection power of God. Through regeneration, God has wrought His life into us, which means that He has wrought His great resurrection power into us. The life which is in us today can make us as strong and transcending as God. Just as God is able to overcome death, we also are able to overcome death because of the great power of this life within us. This life can make us like God to such an extent.</p>
<p>The life of God is not only rich but also powerful. As far as His riches are concerned, all the fullness of the Godhead is in this life. As far as His power is concerned, the great power of this resurrection life can overcome death and surpass every negative thing. This life is as rich and as powerful as God. This is the life that we have obtained; this life is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">All the Natural Functions of God&rsquo;s Life<br />
Being the Law of Life</h2>
<p>Since regeneration gives us the life of God, it also gives us the law of life. Because the life of God has entered into us, the law of life that is contained in this life has also been brought into us. Every kind of life has its own innate ability, its natural function. The natural function of a life is its natural law. In other words, the natural function of a certain life is its law of life. The life that is in a creature causes it to have a natural law or a law of life.</p>
<p>Likewise, we need to see that the life of God has a divine ability, which is its natural function. The natural function of the life of God is its natural law or its law of life. When the life of God enters into us, it brings the natural law that is contained in it, and this law becomes the law of life within us. Thus, when the life of God enters into us, the law of life contained in it also enters into us. Since we have gained the life of God through regeneration, we have also gained the law of His life through regeneration.</p><h2 class="head3">The Laws of the Old Testament<br />
Being Written on Tablets of Stone,<br />
but the Law of Life Being Written<br />
on Tablets of the Heart</h2>
<p>The nature of God is contained in the life of God, and the fullness of the Godhead is hidden in the life of God; therefore, the law contained in the life of God is compatible with God Himself and with the nature of God. Hence, this law is the law of God Himself. In other words, it is God coming to be our law. The laws of life that the life of God brings into us are the laws spoken of in Hebrews 8:10, which have been imparted into our mind and inscribed on our heart. These laws are different from the laws of the Old Testament. The laws of the Old Testament are the laws that God wrote with characters on stone tablets outside of man (Exo. 34:1, 28), but the laws of life are the laws that God has written with His life on our heart within us.</p>
<p>The laws which were written on the stone tablets are outward laws of letter, dead laws, and laws without power; they are laws which are unable to accomplish anything upon man (Rom. 8:3; Heb. 7:18-19). The laws which are written on the tablet of our heart are the inward laws of life, living laws, and laws with great power; they enable us not only to know the heart&rsquo;s desire of God and to follow His will but also to know God Himself and live out God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Law of Life Being a Natural Law<br />
with Its Natural Function</h2>
<p>The natural laws contained in any kind of life always enable a creature to spontaneously know how to live and act; thus, they are living laws within a creature. A hen lives and lays eggs according to the natural laws contained in the hen&rsquo;s life. She spontaneously knows how to do these things and thus lives them out. No man needs to give her any outward law. The natural laws in her life are living laws within her. They spontaneously enable her to know how she should live and even enable her to live in this way. Hence, natural laws, not outward regulations, cause her to live a certain way; this is the inward law of life.</p>
<p>Likewise, the natural laws contained in the life of God are its natural abilities; they enable us to spontaneously know how God desires us to act, how to be pleasing to Him, and how to live Him. The natural abilities, or the natural laws, of the life of God enable us to know whether something agrees with the nature of God or contradicts the nature of God, whether it is something God wants us to do or something God does not want us to do. Thus, the natural abilities, or the natural laws, of the life of God become our inward laws.</p>
<p>Because the laws which are written in us are the natural abilities and natural laws of the life of God, the Bible calls them <em>laws</em>. The law of the Spirit of life, spoken of in Romans 8:2, is the law of life in us. This law is called the law of the Spirit of life because it is derived from the life of God. The life of God is in the Spirit of God, and this life cannot be separated from the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Living by the Law of Life</h2>
<p>The life of God is powerful; the Spirit of God is also powerful. Since the law of the Spirit of life is derived from God, the powerful life and the powerful Spirit of God must also be in the law of the Spirit of life. The life of God in us is the source of this law, and the Spirit of God in us is the Executor of this law. This law enables us to have not only divine knowledge but also divine power. Once we are regenerated with the life of God and the law of the Spirit of life is in us, God desires that we be His people and live in Him according to this strong and mighty law, this law of great power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A New Heart</h2>
<h2 class="head3">A Heart of Stone Becoming a Heart of Flesh</h2>
<p>What is a new heart? To have a new heart means that our old heart has become new. God gives us a new heart by renewing our old heart. Ezekiel 36:26 says that God gives us a new heart and puts a new spirit within us; He takes away the heart of stone out of our flesh and gives us a heart of flesh. Taking away our heart of stone and giving us a heart of flesh means that He gives us a new heart by renewing our old heart. Originally, our old heart opposed God and did not desire God. Our heart was as hard as stone toward God; it was a &ldquo;heart of stone.&rdquo; However, when the Holy Spirit regenerates us, He causes our heart to repent of sin and become soft toward God; hence, our heart of stone becomes a &ldquo;heart of flesh.&rdquo; Our hard stony heart is our old heart; our soft heart of flesh is the new heart God gives us. This means that when we are regenerated, God renews our old heart and makes it soft.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Loving God and the Things of God</h2>
<p>Our heart is the organ of our inclination and affection; it represents us with regard to our inclination, affection, delight, and desire. All our inclinations, affections, delights, and desires are functions of our heart. Before we were regenerated, our heart was inclined toward sin, loved the world, and desired things of passion. However, it was cold and hard toward God, without any inclination and affection. When God regenerates us, He renews our heart and makes our heart a new heart with new inclinations, new affections, and new delights. Once we are regenerated and saved, our heart inclines toward God, loves God, and desires God; it also delights in and desires spiritual things, heavenly things, and the things of God. Whenever such things are spoken of, our heart is joyful, responsive, and desirous. This is the function of our new heart.</p>
<p>God renews our heart and gives us a new heart through regeneration because He wants us to incline toward Him, adore Him, and desire Him. Previously, we did not love Him and could not love Him because our heart was old and hard. Once He renews, softens, and turns our heart, we are able and willing to love Him. Since our heart is a new heart, it has a new function. This new function is to incline toward God and to love God and the things of God.</p><h2 class="head2">A New Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Deadened Spirit<br />
Being Renewed and Made Alive</h2>
<p>What is a new spirit? A new spirit means that our old spirit, which was deadened, has been renewed and made alive. Just as a new heart is an old heart made new, a new spirit is an old spirit made new. When our old heart is renewed, it is softened; when our old spirit is renewed, it is made alive. Whereas the trouble with an old heart is hardness, the trouble with an old spirit is deadness. Therefore, when God regenerates us, He renews our old, hardened heart by softening it to become a new heart, and He renews our old, deadened spirit by enlivening it to become a new spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Renewed by Having the Element of God Added into Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The created spirit of man was originally the organ for man to contact God. Man had fellowship with God and communed with God through his spirit. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, his spirit was damaged by the defilement of sin. Thus, the human spirit lost its function toward God and became a deadened spirit. For our spirit to be deadened means that it stopped functioning, and because it was deadened, it became old. When we are regenerated, the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses the defilement of our spirit. Then the Spirit of God enlivens our spirit by putting the life of God, which is the element of God, into our spirit. In this way, our old deadened spirit is renewed and becomes a new living spirit.</p>
<p>The old creation is related to two points. The first point involves the absence of the element of God, and the second point involves the defilement and corruption by Satan and sin. Our spirit is an old spirit because of these two points. Hence, when God regenerates us, He works in two directions in order to renew our old spirit to make it a new spirit. On one hand, He uses the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse the defilement of our spirit so that our spirit becomes clean. On the other hand, He puts His life into our spirit through His Spirit so that our spirit may have His element. Thus, He renews our old spirit and makes it a new spirit. His renewing of our old spirit and making it a new spirit means that He puts a new spirit in us. In other words, God makes our old spirit a new spirit by adding His life into our spirit so that it may have the life of God and the element of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A New Heart Loving God,<br />
and a New Spirit Contacting God</h2>
<p>Even though God gives us a new heart at the time of our regeneration, He puts a new spirit in us because the heart can only desire God and love God; it cannot contact God or touch God. The heart can desire and love God but not contact and touch Him. Therefore, it is not sufficient for God to simply give us a new heart; He must also put a new spirit in us. Only a new spirit can enable us to contact God and fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the heart is the organ of our inclination and love. Therefore, the function of the heart toward God is to incline toward Him and love Him. The heart can pant after God and thirst after Him, but it cannot contact God or touch Him. The heart can function to love God and thirst for God, but it does not have the ability to contact God or touch Him. It is the spirit that can contact God, not the heart. The heart is good only for loving God, but the spirit is good for contacting God and fellowshipping with God. I may have a nice pen and like it very much, but my heart cannot contact or take possession of it because it does not have this ability. Only my hands have such an ability. Therefore, when we are regenerated, God not only gives us a new heart; He also puts a new spirit within us.</p>
<p>With a new heart we can desire God and love God, and with a new spirit we can contact God and touch God. Our new heart enables us to have new delights and inclinations and new feelings and interests toward God and the things of God. Our new spirit, however, enables us to have new contact and insight and new spiritual ability and function toward God and the things of God. Formerly, we neither loved God nor liked the spiritual things of God; moreover, we could not contact God or understand the spiritual things of God. But now we have a new heart and a new spirit; therefore, we can love God and the things of God, and we can also contact God and know God and the things of God. Formerly, we had no feeling toward God and no interest in God; we were weak and without any ability whatsoever toward God and the things of God. But with a new heart and a new spirit, we not only have feeling and interest toward God and the things of God, but we also are able to contact God and understand the things of God. When our heart loves God, our spirit touches Him, and when our heart delights in the things of God, our spirit understands them. This is the intention of God in giving us a new spirit in addition to a new heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit</h2>
<p>Originally, we did not have the Spirit of God in us, and our spirit was dead toward God. When God regenerated us, He put His life into our spirit through His Spirit, enlivening our deadened spirit. He also put His Spirit into our spirit, causing His Spirit to dwell in our new spirit, which has been made alive. Thus, within those who have been regenerated, there is not only a new enlivened spirit, which has the element of God&rsquo;s life, but also the indwelling Spirit of God.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are at least seven functions of the Spirit of God in us. He is the indwelling Spirit, the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, the Spirit of life, the seal, the pledge, and the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">As the Indwelling Spirit</h2>
<p>God puts His Spirit in us so that His Spirit may be the indwelling Spirit in order for us to know God and to experience all that God in Christ has accomplished for us (Rom. 8:9-11). This is the special blessing that God has given to us in the New Testament age, which was not possible in the Old Testament age. In the Old Testament, God only caused His Spirit to come from without to work upon man; He did not cause His Spirit to dwell within man. After the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, God has given His Spirit to us and caused His Spirit to dwell in us as the indwelling Spirit (John 14:16-17). He is able to reveal both God and Christ to us from within so that in Christ we may enjoy the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9-10).</p><h2 class="head3">As the Comforter</h2>
<p>The Lord said in John 14:16-17 that He would ask the Father to give us the Spirit, who would dwell in us as another Comforter. The Greek word for <em>Comforter</em> is the same as the word <em>Advocate</em> in 1 John 2:1, which means &ldquo;an advocate by the side.&rdquo; Originally, God gave His Son to be our Comforter. Following the Son&rsquo;s ascension, He gave the Spirit as another Comforter; that is, God sent His Son as the Spirit to be our Comforter in another form. The Spirit of God dwelling in us is Christ in another form, taking care of us from within. He is fully responsible for us within, just as He is responsible for us before God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">As the Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>In John 14:16-17 the Lord said that the Spirit who would come to dwell in us as another Comforter would be &ldquo;the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; The Spirit of God dwelling in us is also the Spirit of reality. The Spirit of reality causes everything of God and Christ to be reality within us. All that God is and has prepared for us through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection is revealed and imparted to us as reality by the Spirit of God who dwells in us. Thus, we may touch and experience these realities so that they become ours.</p>
<p>Without the Spirit, all that God is and has done and all that Christ is and has done cannot be touched by us. When the Spirit comes, He causes all that God is and has done and all that Christ is and has done to become reality so that we may touch and experience them. Hence, He is the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spirit in us is the Spirit of life, the seal, the pledge, and the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Life in Us</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9-10 shows that the Spirit of God dwelling in us is the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us is Christ dwelling in us. In other words, the Spirit of God in us is Christ in another form. Since regeneration causes us to receive the Spirit of God, it also causes us to receive Christ. When we believe, God reveals Christ in us through His Spirit. Therefore, once we receive Christ as our Savior, He dwells in us as the Spirit. Christ dwells in us so that He can be our life. Although Christ dwells in us to be our all, the central reason for His indwelling is to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Causing Us to Grow into His Image</h2>
<p>God in His salvation has regenerated us so that we might receive His life, have His nature, and thereby be like Him entirely. His life in Christ is for us to receive, and He wants Christ to be our life. Although His Spirit puts His life in us and enables us to know, experience, and live out His life, this life is Christ. Christ dwelling in us means that He lives in us as our life and wants to live out from us. Thus, He wants us to grow in His life into His image and be wholly and absolutely like Him. When we grow in His life into His image and become like Him, we grow into the image of God and become like God because He is the image of God.</p>
<p>The life of God is all that God is. The life of God in Christ means that all of God is in Christ. Christ is the incarnation of God, the embodiment of God. All that God is and all the fullness of the Godhead dwell in Christ bodily. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s dwelling in us causes us to be filled with all the fullness of the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Our Hope of Glory</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s dwelling in us as our life enables us not only to enjoy all the fullness of the Godhead today, but also to enter into the glory of God in the future. As the One dwelling in us today, He is our life and our hope of glory. His dwelling in us as our life means that He will cause us to grow and become like God and have the image of God through the life of God. We are growing in the life of God into the image of God and eventually into the glory of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God in Christ, Christ Becoming the Spirit,<br />
and the Spirit Dwelling in Us</h2>
<p>Since regeneration causes us to gain Christ, it causes us to have God because Christ is the embodiment of God. Ever since we were regenerated, God in Christ has been dwelling in us through His Spirit. The apostle John says that we know God abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us (1 John 3:24; 4:13). The Lord Jesus also says that He and God abide together in us (John 14:23). God is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit dwelling in us is Christ dwelling in us, and Christ dwelling in us is God dwelling in us. God in Christ dwells in us, and Christ as the Spirit dwells in us. Therefore, when we have the Spirit dwelling in us, we have Christ and God dwelling in us. All three&mdash;the Spirit, Christ, and God&mdash;dwell in us as one; that is, the Triune God dwells in us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Operating, Christ Living,<br />
and the Spirit Anointing</h2>
<p>When the Bible speaks of the Spirit dwelling in us, its emphasis is on His anointing in us (1 John 2:27); when it speaks of Christ dwelling in us, its emphasis is on His living in us as our life (Gal. 2:20); and when it speaks of God dwelling in us, its emphasis is on His operating in us to do His work (Phil. 2:13; Heb. 13:21; 1 Cor. 12:6). The Bible makes a clear distinction in regard to these three matters. In regard to the Spirit dwelling in us, it speaks of anointing; in regard to Christ dwelling in us, it speaks of living; and in regard to God dwelling in us, it speaks of operating. These three expressions are not interchangeable, because the anointing is related to the Spirit as the ointment in us; living is related to Christ being life in us; and operating is related to God working in us.</p>
<p>The Spirit, by anointing us, anoints the element of God into us. Christ, by living in us, lives the life of God both in us and out from us. God, by operating in us, works His will into us so that it may be accomplished upon us. The first aspect is related to the element of God, the second aspect is related to the life of God, and the third aspect is related to the will of God. It is the Holy Spirit who anoints us with the element of God, it is Christ who lives the life of God in us, and it is God Himself who operates in us to work out His will.</p>
<p>What we gain through regeneration is so great, so high, so rich, and so glorious. Through regeneration we gain the life of God, the law of life, a new heart, and a new spirit. Through regeneration we further gain the Spirit, Christ, and God Himself. These are sufficient to make us holy and spiritual, sufficient to make us victorious and transcendent, and sufficient to make us grow and mature in life. We have no reason for not growing unto maturity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SENSE OF LIFE AND<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h1>
<p>Let us review what we received through regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>First, we received the life of God through regeneration. This life includes God&rsquo;s nature and resurrection power. Once we receive the life of God, we have the nature of God, which is related to God&rsquo;s attributes, and the resurrection power of God, which is related to His actions. Therefore, those who have the life of God spontaneously can be what God is and do what God does. What God is and what He does come out of His life. Since this life is in us, it enables us to live out the image of God and to live out God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Second, we received the law of life through regeneration. The law of life is the innate ability of life. Every kind of life has an innate ability, which is its natural capability. This innate ability or capability is manifested according to a natural law, the law of life. We need to remember these terms: <em>innate ability, capability,</em> and <em>law.</em> The innate ability of life, the natural capability of life, or we may say, the law of life, regulates us from within according to God.</p>
<p>Every living creature has a law within its life. The higher the life, the stronger are its law, its innate ability, and its natural capability. Because the life of God is the highest life, the innate ability and the natural law within God&rsquo;s life are the strongest.</p>
<p>The way that a hen lives and lays eggs is not controlled by an outward law given by man but by the innate ability of its life, which is a natural law. The law of life within a hen enables it to live a hen&rsquo;s life and lay eggs regularly. This is not only the case with animal life but also with plant life. For example, an apple tree will bear apples when it grows to a certain stage. This is not the result of outward regulations and demands but of an innate ability or capability of life, that is, its natural law.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW HEART</h2>
<p>Third, we received a new heart through regeneration. A new heart is related to both nature and innate ability. In regard to nature, our heart was hardened; it was as hard as stone. But now it has been softened, and it is as soft as flesh. Our heart has been changed from a heart of stone into a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26). Our heart was hardened in the past because of the fall; it was as hard as stone. It was stubborn toward God, rejected God, opposed God, and forsook God. Thus, it was a &ldquo;heart of stone.&rdquo; However, at the time of our regeneration, God caused our heart to repent of sin and become soft toward Him; hence, our &ldquo;heart of stone&rdquo; became a &ldquo;heart of flesh.&rdquo; Our old heart was as hard as stone, but the new heart that God has given us is a soft heart.</p>
<p>According to the innate ability of our new heart, our heart now inclines toward God, loves God, and desires God. All our inclinations, affections, delights, and desires toward things are functions of our heart. Before we were regenerated, our heart inclined toward sins, desired the world, and loved lustful things. However, when God regenerated us, He renewed our heart, causing it to incline toward God, delight in God, desire God, and love God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Fourth, we received a new spirit through regeneration (v. 26). We need to pay attention to the nature and innate ability of our new spirit. The nature of our new spirit is living; our new spirit is our old, deadened spirit which has been renewed and enlivened. Man was damaged by the defilement of sin because of the fall. Thus, the human spirit lost its function toward God and became deadened. However, when God regenerated us, He put His life into our spirit and quickened our spirit, making our spirit alive. In this way, our deadened spirit became a new and living spirit; this new, living spirit has been restored in its function and use toward God. The innate ability of our new spirit allows us to touch God, contact God, know God, and taste God.</p>
<p>We must be clear about the different functions of the heart and spirit. The heart enables us to adore God, love God, and desire God, but it does not enable us to contact God. Our heart has the desire but not the ability to contact God. The ability to contact God rests with our spirit; we can contact God and touch God only by the spirit. Concerning the things of God, our heart has a willingness, but only the spirit has the necessary ability. When our heart is willing and our spirit is exercised, we can contact God. On one hand, if we have an able spirit but an unwilling heart, we will not be able to contact God. On the other hand, if we have a willing heart but an unexercised spirit, we still will not be able to contact God. Therefore, we must clearly understand that the heart is related to willingness and the spirit to ability.</p>
<p>We often say that someone does not have a heart for God. By this, we mean that he is not willing to receive God and does not desire God. When a person has a heart for God, he is willing to receive God and desires God. This is the first step. The second step is to exercise the spirit. It is not enough for a person to have a heart and use only his heart; he must exercise his spirit as well. Many Christians have a heart for the Lord, but few exercise their spirit. It is precious when a brother or a sister has a heart for the Lord and loves the Lord, but it is even more precious when they exercise their spirit to contact the Lord. The heart needs to be moved, and the spirit needs to be exercised. The heart is related to emotion, and the spirit is related to ability. It is not enough simply to have a heart; we must also learn to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>However, in order for a person to exercise his spirit, he must first have a willing heart. If he is unwilling to seek and love God, he will not be able to exercise his spirit. This is because our heart is the base, and our spirit acts according to the heart. We can exercise our spirit only when we love God and desire God with our heart. We emphasize learning to exercise our spirit because it is relatively simple to have a willing heart. As long as we do not allow anything other than Christ to occupy our heart, we can love God. However, we need to be trained in different aspects related to the spirit, because this involves matters that are not so simple. We need to be clear about the different functions of our heart and spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s renewing of our heart is for our heart to be softened, and His renewing of our spirit is for our spirit to be enlivened. This is the reason He gives us a new spirit in addition to a new heart. If a person merely has a willing heart, he will still not be able to contact God. In order for him to contact God, he must exercise his spirit. We may desire God but still not contact God. We can contact God only when we exercise our spirit. This is the reason God gives us a new heart and a new spirit. My heart may be willing to pick up an object, but if my hands do not cooperate, I will not be able. This can be compared to having a desire but not the ability to achieve it. In order to contact God we need our heart in addition to our spirit. Our heart is related to willingness, and our spirit is related to ability.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">As the Seal and the Pledge</h2>
<p>In addition to the life of God, the law of life, a new heart, and a new spirit, we also received the Spirit, Christ, and God Himself at the time of our regeneration. The Spirit, Christ, and God each have a particular work within us. According to the teaching of the Bible, there are seven main aspects of the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us: He works as the indwelling Spirit, as the Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, as the Spirit of life, as the seal, as the pledge, and as the anointing. It is quite difficult to understand the seal and the pledge (Eph. 1:13-14). As the seal, the Holy Spirit seals us with God Himself. The Holy Spirit seals us with God Himself, not with other things. When we stamp something onto a piece of paper with a seal, the impression on the paper is exactly the same as the impression on the seal. When I stamp a seal with my name onto a blank piece of paper, the impression on the paper is exactly the same as my name on the seal.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit seals us, He stamps us with God as the seal. We were a blank piece of paper, but the Holy Spirit seals us with God Himself. The mark upon us is God Himself. This is the reason we have the image of God and can be like God. There is now a mark upon us because we have been sealed by the Holy Spirit with all that God is; this mark is God Himself as a seal upon us. As a result, we have the image of God and can be like God.</p>
<p>The pledge is a &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; given to us by God. When a person goes to a pawnshop for money, he leaves an article as a pledge, a security and guarantee, that the money will be paid back in a certain amount of time. If the money is not paid back, the article that has been left as a pledge will be kept. The Holy Spirit is a pledge, a security, given to us from God to guarantee that God Himself and all that He has will be our portion and inheritance for our enjoyment. With the Holy Spirit as the pledge, God will not withhold what He has intended for us. On one hand, the Holy Spirit within us is a seal, sealing God into us; on the other hand, the Holy Spirit is a pledge, guaranteeing that God will be our enjoyment and our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Anointing</h2>
<p>Some people ask, &ldquo;How does the work of the Spirit in us differ from the work of Christ in us and the work of God in us?&rdquo; The Bible emphasizes the work of the Spirit in us as the anointing ointment (1 John 2:27), the work of Christ in us as our life, and the work of God in us for the accomplishment of His will. The Spirit&rsquo;s anointing in us, as the anointing ointment, can be compared to the paint of a painter. A painter coats chairs and tables repeatedly with paint, and in the end, the chairs and tables have the gloss and color of the paint. They not only look like the paint, but they have the very element of the paint.</p>
<p>We were originally like pieces of unpainted wood; we did not have any of the element of God. However, by the Spirit as the anointing ointment in us, we have the work of anointing in us. This anointing anoints us with God Himself so that we are not only like God but become the likeness of God because we have the very element of God in us. Every time the Spirit operates in us and anoints us, the element of God increases in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Difference between Moving and Anointing</h2>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s anointing in us is often understood by Christians as the Spirit&rsquo;s moving. Actually, in the New Testament we cannot find the word <em>moving</em> in relation to the Spirit; however, the New Testament does speak of the anointing. The work of the Spirit within us is not merely to move us but to anoint us. What does <em>moving</em> mean? A person who does not do anything or is unwilling to do anything can be inspired to move or take some action. However, even though we may move him to take some action, he is still who he is, and we are still who we are; there is no relationship between him and us. The anointing, however, is not like this. When we anoint someone, it may be likened to applying paint on him, which eventually causes a certain element to be added into him. Moving is different from anointing. Nothing has been added to the one who has been &ldquo;moved.&rdquo; After anointing, however, a certain element has been added. The more anointing there is, the more the element is added.</p>
<p>The work of the Spirit is to anoint us. Every time He anoints us within, the element of God increases within us. But if the Spirit only &ldquo;moves&rdquo; us, we are merely taking an action; no element of God has been added to us. Being &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by the Spirit is a fallen concept in Christianity and, in particular, in Catholicism. This concept or thought is related to the fact that Christians do not know that God&rsquo;s intention is to have a relationship with man by being added into man. Since God wants a relationship with us, it is not enough for the Spirit to merely move us to do certain things; rather, the Spirit anoints us with the element of God so that God and man can do things together.</p>
<p>Many Christians still have this fallen thought of Christianity and this poison of Catholicism. They do not have much spiritual growth because after they are &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by the Spirit, they remain who they are, and the Lord remains the Lord. No matter how many times they are &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by the Spirit and actually do certain things, day after day, year after year, they remain who they are, and the Lord remains the Lord. They are not transformed, and nothing of the element of God has been added into them. This is the so-called &ldquo;moving&rdquo; of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are anointed, however, a certain element is added into us. Today the work of the Holy Spirit is to anoint us with God Himself. In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit is typified by the holy anointing oil (Exo. 30:31). No one was allowed to make an imitation of the holy anointing oil because it was unique. God is unique; the anointing oil, which represents God Himself, was also unique. No one could make an imitation of the anointing oil; it had to be prepared absolutely according to the way shown by God. This means that man should not try to imitate the anointing oil because the anointing oil is God Himself. As far as the type is concerned, the anointing oil is God Himself. Therefore, we should not involve ourselves with the matter of being &ldquo;moved&rdquo; but rather with being anointed.</p>
<p>If we are &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by the Holy Spirit to go and preach the gospel, we may preach the gospel and do something, but has the element of God been added to us through our preaching of the gospel? This can be compared to the story in the Old Testament about Balaam&rsquo;s donkey which was moved by Jehovah to speak like a man (Num. 22:28, 30). Although the donkey spoke, it was still a donkey. However, the New Testament teaches us that the Holy Spirit anoints us with God (1 John 2:27). By this anointing, we may have a sense that God is leading and urging us to preach the gospel. When we respond to this sense, we are not merely accomplishing a work of preaching the gospel, but more importantly, God is being added into us, and we are gaining God Himself.</p>
<p>If one delivers a message merely because he has been &ldquo;moved,&rdquo; God will still be God after the message; nothing of God will have been added to him. However, if the Holy Spirit anoints him in his speaking, not only will those who hear gain something, but the speaker will gain something even more. When the Holy Spirit anoints him inwardly in his speaking, he receives the Spirit and he receives more of the element of God. After speaking, God will be increased in him, and the more he speaks, the more the element of God will be added into him. There is a great difference between the anointing of the Spirit and the &ldquo;moving&rdquo; of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we come to the sense of life. Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; Whenever we feel weak, there is a sense of death within us. Whenever we are in pain, there is a sense of death within us. Whenever we feel dark, even more there is a sense of death within us. We need to be clear that these negative feelings&mdash;weakness, emptiness, depression, darkness, and pain&mdash;are all related to the sense of death; they are senses of the flesh. In contrast, positive feelings of being strong, satisfied, lively, bright, and restful are all related to the sense of life; they are senses of the spirit. Strength is in contrast to weakness, satisfaction to emptiness, liveliness to depression, brightness to darkness, and rest to pain. The sense of life involves peace, which is rest, and the sense of life includes rest, which is peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Guiding and Proving</h2>
<p>The function of the sense of life within us is to guide us and prove us. However, this guiding and proving by the sense of life is not for us to know right or wrong but rather to give us peace. Being right or wrong, which is according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, is a fallen thought in Christianity. This thought must be overthrown. The sense of life within us is not related to right or wrong; rather, it guides and proves us according to peace.</p>
<p>The sense of life is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong in doing certain things. Instead, it is a matter of whether we are doing them according to the leading of the Holy Spirit in us or according to ourselves. When we do things according to our inner sense, do we touch God and life or do we sense darkness and depression? Based on the sense of life, when we do certain things, we should sense that we are touching God more and more and that we have the presence of the Holy Spirit and the anointing. On the contrary, if we feel empty, dark, and depressed within, this indicates that we have lost God and the sense of life; this is to be in death and in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">No Longer I, but Christ</h2>
<p>Being right or wrong is altogether a fallen thought that belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The sense of life is related to the tree of life, not to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, the sense of life is not related to a sense of good or evil or a sense of right or wrong. Rather, it causes us to sense whether we are touching God and whether we have the presence of the Holy Spirit, the anointing, and the peace of life. Visiting a saint should not be a matter of right or wrong, which is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and according to Mount Sinai; right and wrong are not related to Golgotha. Mount Sinai is a matter of right or wrong; Golgotha is a matter of no longer I, but Christ (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Mount Sinai is a matter of what we should or should not do. What we should do is a matter of right, and what we should not do is a matter of wrong. This was the situation at Mount Sinai. Golgotha, however, is not a matter of right or wrong. Rather, Golgotha is a matter of our being terminated on the cross and of Christ living in us. It is &ldquo;no longer I who live, but it is Christ&rdquo;; we are terminated and finished, and now Christ lives in us. No matter what action we take, no matter what kind of living we have, and no matter what we do, the sense of life within us causes us to know whether we are touching God, and it proves to us whether we are living in or outside of God.</p>
<p>For instance, when a person is giving a message, the sense of life will give him a feeling and prove him within so that he will know while he is speaking whether he is in God or outside of God and whether he is touching God. From our point of view, giving a message is a good thing, and while it may seem right for someone to give a message, the giving of the message may not be according to the sense of life. The sense of life involves whether our speaking is in God or outside of God and whether we are touching God in our speaking. It also is a wonderful and godly matter for saints to pray in the meeting. This matter is absolutely unrelated to right or wrong because it is always good and right to pray. However, the inner sense of life still tests and proves whether our prayer is in spirit or outside the spirit and whether it touches God. If we pray outside of God and outside of the spirit, we are praying in death, and this prayer will be dry, depressed, weak, dark, and empty. If we pray in our spirit, however, our prayer will be a prayer in life, and we will feel lively, comfortable, strong, bright, satisfied, and at ease. Even those around us will sense strength, liveliness, satisfaction, brightness, and comfort when they hear our prayer. This will prove that our prayer is in the spirit and has touched the Spirit and that we are in God and have touched God.</p>
<p>We have said repeatedly that we need to drop the concept of right or wrong and good or bad. The only thought we should have is whether we are in God or outside of God, whether we have the presence of the Spirit, and whether we have touched the feeling of the Spirit. Our concern should only be whether we are in God or outside of God, whether we have touched the Spirit, and whether we do things out of life or out of death. We must be clear that good things as well as bad things are related to death; both right things and wrong things are related to death.</p>
<p>If every word that a saint prays is right, but his words are void of Spirit and life, his words will still make people feel empty and depressed. Thus, even right words can bring people into death. In contrast, some saints may not be able to clearly utter some words in their prayers. Even their prayers may not be proper grammatically, but every sentence causes others to touch Spirit and life. Even though their sentence structure and choice of words are incorrect, their prayers have the Spirit and cause others to touch the presence of God and to sense God&rsquo;s feeling. This is a prayer of life, a prayer in the Spirit. We need to continue steadfastly in this kind of exercise.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning the fellowship of life, please refer to chapter 6 of <em>The Knowledge of Life.</em></p>
<p>First John 1:2-3 says, &ldquo;We [the apostles]...report to you [the believers] the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These verses show that the apostles reported <em>the eternal life</em> that we would have <em>fellowship.</em> The eternal life is the life of God, and the life of God entering into us enables us to have fellowship. Since this fellowship comes out of the life of God, it is the fellowship of life. Therefore, the fellowship of life comes from the life of God, its existence is due to the life of God, it is derived from the life of God, and it is brought to us by the life of God. As soon as we obtain the life of God within us, this life enables us to have the fellowship of life. The life of God, therefore, is the source of the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>Since the source of the fellowship of life is the life of God, it is called the fellowship of life. This fellowship comes from the unique life of God. At the beginning of 1 John 1, the apostle John says that he reported the life of God so that we would receive the fellowship of this life. Therefore, we must bear in mind that the source of the fellowship of life is the life of God, which is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit Being Different<br />
from the &ldquo;Moving&rdquo; of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God, and the life of God enters into us and lives in us through the Holy Spirit. Even though the fellowship brought to us by the life of God is derived from the life of God, it comes to us by means of the Holy Spirit. The source of fellowship is the life of God, and the means of fellowship is the Spirit of God. Hence, the Bible speaks of the &ldquo;fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14).</p>
<p>If the Holy Spirit can only &ldquo;move&rdquo; us, He does not have a relationship with us. However, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a mingling; it mingles God with us and brings us into God through fellowship. While &ldquo;moving&rdquo; is objective, fellowship is subjective. The Greek word for <em>fellowship</em> has the meaning of &ldquo;oneness.&rdquo; This means that the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the fellowship of life, causes us to become one with God, to be mingled with God. God enters into us to be mingled with us so that He and we can become one. When God fellowships with us and we contact Him, He and we become one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of the Fellowship of Life</h2>
<p>The life of God which enters into us is neither confined nor static; it is flowing. It can be likened to the circulation of blood in our body. While we may not be aware of it, the blood in our body is flowing unceasingly. Therefore, any one portion of the blood in our body is not the blood of simply that one part or the blood of the whole body; it is flowing blood. While I am standing here speaking, the blood in my body will circulate several times before I have finished a few sentences. This is circulation and flowing; this is the meaning of fellowship.</p>
<p>The life of God within us is like this. It has flowed out from God and into thousands of saints including us. This flowing life is from God. It passes through God and passes through thousands of saints. Thus, it enables us to have fellowship with God and with thousands of saints. Outwardly speaking, a light bulb may seem independent, but inwardly there is a flow. This flow allows every light bulb to be in communication with not only the power plant but also with all the other light bulbs. The continuous movement of the dials on the electric meter shows that electric current is flowing continuously. From the outside, every electric light bulb is independent of one another, but actually electricity is flowing continuously from within each bulb to the others. The electric current in each light bulb is a communication.</p>
<p>Apparently, Paul is Paul, Brother Nee is Brother Nee, I am myself, and you are yourself; however, as far as the inward life is concerned, we are all in one fellowship, one flow. The life within us is connected to God who is on the throne in heaven, to Paul, to Brother Nee, to myself, and to you. We are all connected to one another, just as electricity in a light bulb is connected to the electricity in another light bulb. This electricity, beyond being merely connected, flows from one bulb to another. This is the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Fellowship of Life</h2>
<p>The function or use of the fellowship of life is to inwardly supply us with all that is in the life of God, with all that is in God. Since this life is the content of God, even God Himself, it supplies us with the content of God and even God Himself when it flows in us. All the fullness in God is supplied to us through the fellowship of life. The more we allow this flowing life to flow in us, the more we are inwardly supplied with the fullness of God. The supply of the fellowship of life is like the circulating blood that supplies the body and the flowing electricity that supplies the lights.</p>
<p>Physically, we can be supplied continuously within because of our blood supply. Through the circulation of blood, all the nutrients that our body needs are supplied to us. In the same way, all the nutrients for our spiritual life are supplied by the fellowship of life because the fellowship of life supplies the content of God, even God Himself.</p>
<p>The fellowship of life and the sense of life are mutually related. As soon as the fellowship of life is interrupted, the sense of life causes us to feel a loss of the supply of life. Immediately, we feel weak, depressed, dark, empty, and in pain. When the fellowship of life is not interrupted, however, the sense of life causes us to feel the supply of life. We feel strong, lively, satisfied, bright, and comfortable. Therefore, whether we are living in the fellowship of life and have the supply of life depends entirely on the sense of life. The more we live in the fellowship of life, the keener is the sense of life and the more we will sense the supply of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOLLOWING THE INNER SENSE</h1>
<p>When God created man in the beginning, he saw that man was good (Gen. 1:31). This means that in God&rsquo;s eyes, the created human life is good. Before a person is saved, he has this created goodness, and all his senses derive from this goodness. However, this created goodness was corrupted and defiled because of man&rsquo;s fall. Consequently, the most that this defiled and damaged goodness can provide is a consciousness of good in the conscience. However, a saved person, a normal Christian, in contrast to an unbeliever, has an additional sense&mdash;the divine sense of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S INNER SENSE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Limiting and Restricting Man</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s inner sense is used by God to limit, restrict, and restrain man. A person sins because he suppresses his inner sense (Rom. 1:21). When a person suppresses this inner sense, he is capable of committing many sins (vv. 28-31). It is not the policeman who restrains and limits us but rather our inner sense. The first thing that checks and limits our behavior is our inner sense.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Believer&rsquo;s Inner Sense Being Stronger<br />
Than an Unbeliever&rsquo;s Inner Sense</h2>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Who has a stronger inner sense, a good person or an evil person?&rdquo; The better a person is, the stronger his inner sense will be, and the more evil a person is, the weaker his inner sense will be. This is because a person must constantly suppress his inner sense in order to do evil things; thus, his inner sense becomes weaker and weaker. We may also ask if this applies to believers and unbelievers. Christians have a stronger inner sense because the uncreated, divine life of God is in us. This life gives us a sense which is much stronger than the sense that is derived only from our created goodness, which is all that an unbeliever can sense.</p>
<p>Thus, it is easier for an unbeliever to commit sin than it is for a believer, because within a believer there is a strong sense to resist sin. This sense is the sense from God&rsquo;s life. An unbeliever has a sense of conscience, which is the sense of our created goodness; in contrast, a believer not only has a sense of conscience but also a sense of God&rsquo;s life, which causes him to have a stronger inner sense than an unbeliever. Therefore, an unbeliever merely needs to overcome this weaker inner sense of conscience in order to sin; in contrast, a Christian must exert considerable effort to resist and suppress the strong inner sense that comes from God.</p>
<p>God has put a sense within man to serve as a &ldquo;brake.&rdquo; When we are driving a car, we step on the brakes to prevent an accident. The most important part of a car is the brakes; they must be sturdy and effective. The brakes of a good car will bring a car to an immediate stop in an emergency. Even if a car is traveling at a high speed, as soon as a driver steps on the brakes, the car will quickly come to a halt. In order to prevent a car from getting into danger or deviating from the road, a car must have good brakes. Our inner sense is the &ldquo;brake&rdquo; of our whole being.</p>
<p>The created inner sense, the &ldquo;brake,&rdquo; within an unbeliever is weaker in comparison to the sense of God&rsquo;s life. However, with the damage caused by Satan, the defilement of sin, and the corruption of the world, this &ldquo;brake&rdquo; has been greatly weakened and is even less effective. Hence, it is easier for an unbeliever to get into trouble, commit sin, and do evil. With only a little resistance, this inner sense can be annulled and overthrown. The inner sense of life within Christians, however, is strong, or we may say, our &ldquo;brake&rdquo; is powerful. Consequently, a great amount of effort is required to resist it. After an unbeliever commits a sin, the inner feeling of condemnation can be light; however, after a Christian commits a sin, the inner feeling of condemnation is strong. Hence, all God&rsquo;s children should learn to take heed to the inner sense.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s inner sense of life is indeed a great thing; the stronger the inner sense of life, the more operative it will be. If we do not know how to use the &ldquo;brake,&rdquo; that is, how to exercise and care for the inner sense of life, we will be like a driver who does not know how to use his brakes, which is extremely dangerous. The safety of a motorcycle or a car depends on whether a driver uses his brakes in an appropriate manner. If a person does not know how to use the brakes properly, it is certain that he will eventually have an accident. Similarly, if we do not take care of and follow the inner sense, it is possible for us to do all kinds of bad things. Therefore, we should never disregard the inner sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOURCE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
BEING THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>With regard to the fellowship of life, this fellowship is derived from life; it issues from the life of God. In other words, the source of this fellowship of life is the life of God. First John 1:2 says, &ldquo;We...report to you the eternal life.&rdquo; Generally, people use the term <em>preaching,</em> but the apostle John said that he was reporting life. He reported the eternal life to us. Instead of preaching, he reported life to us. When we receive the life he reported, we also receive the fellowship of this life into us. On one hand, this fellowship is with &ldquo;us,&rdquo; referring to the apostles, and on the other hand, it is with &ldquo;the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo; (v. 3).</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANS OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
BEING THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The life of God depends on the Holy Spirit, and it is through the Holy Spirit that this life enters and lives in us. Even though the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life is derived from the life of God, it comes by means of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Bible also calls this fellowship <em>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit</em> (2 Cor. 13:14). This shows clearly that the Holy Spirit causes us to experience the life of God. On one hand, the life of God enters into us through the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, the Holy Spirit causes us to experience the life of God. Therefore, the Holy Spirit causes us to have fellowship in the life of God. All our fellowship of life is in the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:1 says, &ldquo;If there be...any fellowship of the Spirit&rdquo; (KJV). This means that the Spirit of God moves, requires, and urges us within, causing us to have the fellowship which comes from the life of God. Therefore, if we desire to have the fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God but also live in the Spirit. The life of God is the source of the fellowship of life, and the Spirit is the means of the fellowship of life. Although the life of God gives us the fellowship of life, it is the Spirit who causes us to practically enjoy this fellowship of life. Only when we are living and walking in the Spirit by setting our mind on the Spirit can we enjoy the fellowship of the life of God in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
AND OF THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider the function of the fellowship of life and the function of the sense of life. How are these two functions related to each other? The sense of life is the proof of whether we are living in God. The fellowship of life is a supply; that is, it inwardly supplies us with all the riches of God&rsquo;s life. The fellowship of life supplies us with all that God is, but we know whether we are in this fellowship by the sense of life. Whenever we sense death or feel weak, depressed, empty, dark, and in pain, we should realize that we have been cut off from the fellowship of the life of God. However, when we sense life, that is, when we feel strong, lively, bright, comfortable, and satisfied, we should realize that we are living in the fellowship of the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING TO TOUCH THE INNER SENSE</h2>
<p>How can we practice this fellowship of life? Since life is in the Spirit, we need to know how to touch the Spirit in order to practice the fellowship of life. If we do not know how to touch the Spirit, we will not be able to touch the fellowship of life that is in the Spirit. Therefore, in order to practice the fellowship of life, we should practice to touch the Spirit in us. Nevertheless, in order to touch the Spirit in us, we must first touch the inner sense of life.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago we spoke much concerning the Spirit. Many brothers and sisters among us had experiences of the Holy Spirit at that time, but we were not clear about how to touch the Spirit continually. We spoke about following the Holy Spirit, yet we could not see Him or grasp Him like a material object. So we began to pay attention to learning how to follow the Spirit in a detailed way. After many years of seeking and studying, we eventually realized that the most important manifestation of the Spirit in us is the inner sense. Hence, to follow the Spirit is to follow the inner sense; to touch the Spirit is to touch the inner sense. If we do not know how to touch the inner sense, we will not be able to know the Spirit.</p>
<p>For example, a bottle of refined salt and a bottle of refined sugar look exactly the same, and the contents even feel the same. Unless we taste and sense them, we will not know which one is sweet and which one is salty. Because sugar and salt are physical things, we can see them. However, the taste of salt and the taste of sugar are invisible to us; we can only discern them by exercising our sense of taste. Thus, sense is a very important matter. Not only is our spiritual sense important, but even our physical sense is important. If our physical sense is annulled, we will be finished. This is not a matter of seeing but of sensing. If we put a glass of warm water next to a glass of cold water, how can we tell which one is warm and which one is cold? If we drink the water, immediately we will sense whether the water in the glass is warm or cold. The temperature of the water cannot be discerned by sight but by sensation.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s growth in life depends on how he deals with the inner sense. If a person&rsquo;s living is a mess, it shows that he is a person who disregards the inner sense. The stronger a person&rsquo;s life is, the more normal his living will be, because he cares about the inner sense. Others may speak casually and frivolously, but he is dignified and steady; others may dress sloppily, but he is neat and clean. The stronger a person&rsquo;s life is, the more he will live according to the inner sense, and the more normal his living will be. Similarly, with a spiritual person, the stronger the divine life is within him, the keener his sense of life will be and the more normal his spiritual living will be, because he lives absolutely according to that sense.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s physical body, which can be seen and touched, is the means of his physical life. However, spiritual life does not have any means or forms; it depends entirely upon an inner spiritual sense. Thus, the fellowship of life requires us to touch the Spirit, but in order to touch the Spirit, we must touch the inner sense. The inner sense of being strong, satisfied, lively, fitting, at ease, and comfortable are positive feelings. These feelings indicate that we have touched the Spirit. There are feelings, however, that indicate that we have not touched the Spirit. When we sense death, that is, when we sense negative feelings in us such as weakness, darkness, emptiness, depression, and pain, we should realize that we are not in the Spirit and not in the fellowship.</p>
<p>Fellowship is in life, and life is in the Spirit. For us to have the fellowship of life, we must touch the Spirit, and for us to touch the Spirit, we must touch the inner sense. Life is in the Spirit, and this Spirit is the Spirit of God, who is in our spirit. When we speak concerning touching the Spirit, the Spirit we are speaking of is the Spirit of God mingled with our spirit as one spirit. In other words, the Spirit of God is within our human spirit. The Spirit of God is mingled with our human spirit. In this mingled spirit, there is the life of God, and with this life there is fellowship.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit of God is in our spirit. These two spirits are mingled together to be one spirit, and they are inseparable. As long as we touch this mingled spirit, we will be able to touch all spiritual feelings. Originally, the Spirit of God was outside us; He was untouchable and hard to locate. Now, however, the Spirit of God has entered into our spirit, and we can definitely say that the Spirit is in our spirit. We do not need to go up to heaven or down to Hades to look for Him; we simply need to turn to the deepest part of our being, our spirit, and we will be able to touch Him.</p><h2 class="head1">REJECTING THE DISTRACTION OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>As we learn to touch the Spirit in fellowship, we must realize that the one thing that can distract our spirit, or we may say, that can distract us from touching the Spirit, is our soul. Our soul is a distraction, a powerful distraction, which hinders us from touching the Spirit. We all know that our soul consists of three parts&mdash;mind, emotion, and will. Whenever our mind moves, our soul moves; whenever our will moves, our soul also moves. The soul is a distraction to the spirit; hence, to touch the spirit, we must be delivered from the soul and reject the soul. Because our soul is composed of the mind, emotion, and will, to reject the soul is to reject the distractions from our mind, emotion, and will. If we do not learn how to reject the distractions that come from our mind, emotion, and will, we will not be able to touch the sense of the Spirit. This requires exercise.</p>
<p>For example, while we are praying on our knees in the morning, many thoughts often arise in our mind: one moment we may be thinking about America, and the next moment we are thinking about Africa. Our thoughts simply wander all over the place. Such thoughts are very distracting to our prayers, and we know that we need to reject them. However, there are other thoughts which are counterfeit thoughts. These thoughts are difficult to perceive and difficult to recognize as being in need of rejection&mdash;they are the thoughts and suggestions from Satan concerning how we should pray. For example, one moment he may remind us of the needs of the church in another locality, then he will remind us of the spreading of the work, and at still another moment he will remind us of certain saints who are ill, weak, or backslidden. Satan can give many seemingly good and spiritual thoughts while we are praying in order to make us think that these matters are very important. He does not distract us with thoughts of America and Africa; rather, he reminds us of the needs of the churches, the problems concerning our work, and the conditions of the saints, all of which are spiritual and reasonable matters. As a result, we pray according to these thoughts.</p>
<p>Once we pray according to these thoughts, we are no longer in the Spirit because these thoughts belong to the soul, which distract us from the Spirit and cause us to lose the fellowship. Whenever we get out of the Spirit, the fellowship will be cut off, because for us to touch the fellowship, we must touch the Spirit. Therefore, even when seemingly good suggestions and thoughts come up, we need to be careful about praying according to those thoughts because this can interrupt the fellowship between us and the Spirit, causing us to lose the fellowship. Some brothers and sisters may ask what to do when such thoughts arise. At these times, we should learn to touch the sense of the Spirit in us, follow the Spirit, and pray according to the sense of the Spirit. We should not pray according to our thoughts; instead, we should pray according to the sense of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We should pray according to the sense of the Spirit rather than our thoughts because the moment we pray according to our thoughts, we leave the fellowship. How do we know that we have left the fellowship? When we pray according to our thoughts, even if we are praying for good and godly things, we will feel weak, depressed, dark, empty, and in pain. When we pray for the church and the work according to our thoughts, we will feel empty and weak; the more we pray, the lower we will sink, and the darker and more uneasy we will feel. All the feelings of death that we have while watching a movie can be present even in our prayers. This shows that if our prayers do not originate from the Spirit and are not in the Spirit, they will cause us to depart from the fellowship and be cut off from the fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Since fellowship is so important, what is the function of fellowship? The function of fellowship is to supply us with God&rsquo;s life. If we live in the fellowship, there will be a continual supply of God&rsquo;s life within us. The more we pray, the more we will be strengthened. The more we pray, the more we will be satisfied. The more we pray, the more we will rejoice. The more we pray, the more we will be enlightened. And the more we pray, the more we will be refreshed and soothed. This proves that we are praying in fellowship because fellowship brings in the supply of life, and life brings a sense of strength, satisfaction, joy, enlightenment, freshness, and ease. When we have these feelings within, we are praying in the Spirit, and we are in the fellowship because we have touched the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we practice to have fellowship, we need to practice to touch the inner sense, because it is the most accurate manifestation of the Spirit in us. The Spirit is where our life is, and life is the source of fellowship. In other words, fellowship is of life, and life is in the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit. In order to practice fellowship, we need to learn to touch the sense in the Spirit because the manifestation of the Spirit is in the inner sense. We must also learn to reject the soul because of its distractions. Every part of the soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;is a distraction to the Spirit. Therefore, as we learn to touch the Spirit, we must reject the soul.</p>
<p>I hope that we will begin to exercise ourselves to pray, not from our mind, emotion, or will but rather from the sense of the Spirit. This exercise is even more difficult than reading spiritual publications. We can understand spiritual publications after reading them several times, but this exercise requires us to turn to our spirit day by day and moment by moment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE BEING<br />
ONLY IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">One Sense with Five Aspects</h2>
<p>There are five aspects to the one sense of life. First, the sense of life comes from the life of God; second, it comes from the law of life; third, it comes from the Holy Spirit; fourth, it comes from Christ; and fifth, it comes from God. Although the sense of life comes from these five sources&mdash;the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God, it is only one sense, not five. In other words, these five aspects collectively comprise the one sense of life.</p>
<p>These five different sources produce only one sense instead of five, because the Spirit, Christ, and God are actually the Triune God&mdash;the three are one. Because the life of God is also God Himself, the four are one. Moreover, because the law of life comes out from the life of God and is the function of this life, the five are one. Hence, only one sense is produced from these five sources. Actually, the five sources are not five, but one. These five&mdash;the Holy Spirit, Christ, God, life, and the law of life&mdash;are one, which is revealed in five aspects.</p>
<p>These five sources have one designation&mdash;life&mdash;and they produce one sense&mdash;the sense of life. Why is it called the sense of life instead of the sense of the Holy Spirit, the sense of Christ, the sense of God, or the sense of the law of life? The Triune God is in us to be our life; He is life in us. This life involves the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God, and the law of life is the function of the life of God in us. Since these five items are of life, the sense they produce can only be called the sense of life, not the sense of anything else.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Triune God in us is to be life to us, and the function of this life is the law of life. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, Christ, God, and the law of life are all matters of life. Hence, the sense produced from these five is only one sense, which is the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Anointing, Christ Living,<br />
and God Operating</h2>
<p>This sense of life is comprised of five aspects&mdash;life, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God. Being of life refers to its nature being life; being of the law of life refers to its function as a law. With life, the emphasis is on nature. With law, the emphasis is on function. With the Holy Spirit, the emphasis is on the anointing. With Christ, the emphasis is on living. And with God, the emphasis is on operating.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says that it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. First John 2:27 says that we have the anointing in us, which is the moving of the Spirit as an ointment. Philippians 2:13 says that God operates in us both the willing and the working. From these verses, we see that the Spirit is related to anointing, Christ is related to living, and God is related to operating. The Spirit&rsquo;s anointing us is to anoint us with God Himself so that the element of God can increase in us by being added into us. Christ&rsquo;s living in us focuses on His being our life and, thus, becoming our supply. God&rsquo;s operating in us emphasizes His working in us. God desires to add more of His element into us, to live in us as life, and to work in us. With respect to adding His element into us, He is the Spirit. With respect to His living in us as life, He is Christ. With respect to His working in us, He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIFE<br />
AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we need to see the relationship between life and the fellowship of life. The life of God that we receive is a flow. It is neither confined nor static but a flow. Since life is a flow, the meaning of the fellowship of life is the communication of life, the flow of life. The fellowship of life and life are not two separate things but one. The fellowship of life is not something separate from life. When life flows, it is called the fellowship of life. One is the thing itself, and the other is its flow. Life in itself is life, and when it flows, it is called the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>Consider water and water current; there is no difference between the two. Water in itself is water, but when it flows, it becomes a current, a flow, of water. Hence, we cannot say that water is separate from its current; rather, the two are inseparable. In the same way, blood and blood circulation cannot be separated. When the blood in our body circulates, the blood cannot be separated from the blood circulation. Blood refers to the substance itself, and circulation refers to its motion. The motion cannot be separated from the substance. While they are seemingly two, they are actually one; they are two aspects of the same thing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT AND KNOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being the Content and the Issue of the Spirit</h2>
<p>How do we know the Spirit? When Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit, it indicates that life is related to the Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;the Spirit of life&rdquo; (v. 2) and &ldquo;the mind of the Spirit is life&rdquo; (v. 6, ASV). Life is the first thing that is related to the Spirit. <em>The Spirit of life</em> shows that life is the content of the Spirit. The Spirit becomes the Spirit of life because life is the content of the Spirit. When we touch life, we touch the content of the Spirit, and we also touch the Spirit Himself. <em>The mind of the Spirit is life</em> also proves that life is the issue of the Spirit. As long as we set our mind on the Spirit and touch the Spirit, the issue will be life. Therefore, in order to know the Spirit, we need to know life.</p>
<p>Sugar water is water that has sugar as its content, its element; this is why it is called sugar water. Likewise, the Spirit of life is called <em>the Spirit of life</em> because the element of the Spirit is life; life is the content of the Spirit. Since life is the content of the Spirit, life is also the issue of the Spirit. Since sugar is the content and element of the water, when we drink the water, sugar also comes into us. Sugar is the content as well as the issue of the water. Hence, life is the content of the Spirit, and life is also the issue of the Spirit. Whenever we touch the Spirit and set our mind on the Spirit, the issue is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law Being<br />
the Function and Operation of the Spirit</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life&rdquo; in Romans 8:2 shows that the Spirit is not only related to life but also to law. These three things&mdash;life, the Spirit, and law&mdash;are linked together. The Spirit is called the Spirit of life, and this Spirit has a law. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit; law is the function and operation of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Spirit<br />
by the Manifestations of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Since the Spirit is as abstract as electricity, some wonder how we can know the Spirit. Scientists tell us that we can know electricity only by its manifestations. We see electric lamps emitting light, but the light is not electricity itself; it is a manifestation of electricity. No one can see electricity. We cannot open a fluorescent lamp to get some electricity and examine it. Even an expert scientist cannot produce electricity for us to see.</p>
<p>We cannot see electricity, but we can see light, which is an expression of electricity. Likewise, we cannot touch the Spirit, but we can touch the manifestations of the Spirit. Life is a manifestation of the Spirit, and the law of the Spirit of life is also a manifestation of the Spirit. For instance, when we see an electric fan that is motionless, we know that there is no electricity in the fan because the fan is not turning. When the fan turns and moves, we know that electricity is present because of its manifestation. We cannot see electricity because it is invisible. Likewise, it is difficult for us to know the Spirit by the Spirit Himself because the Spirit is invisible.</p>
<p>People in the world acknowledge that there is electricity because they have seen, experienced, and enjoyed the various manifestations of electricity. For example, electricity causes lamps to emit light, radios to produce sound, fans to turn, cars to move, and machines to operate. All of these are manifestations of electricity. For many years we have said that we need to follow the Spirit and live in the Spirit, but in reality, we felt that these sayings were too abstract. We did not know how to follow the Spirit and how to live in the Spirit. Therefore, we only had sayings about living in the Spirit but not the reality of following the Spirit. Gradually, we realized that the Spirit, like electricity, is intangible, so we can know the Spirit only through the manifestations of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Four Manifestations of the Spirit</h2>
<p>When Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit, it also speaks of four things related to the Spirit. The first is life; the second, law; the third, peace; and the fourth, death, which is in contrast to life and peace. These four items are manifestations of the Spirit. There is not another chapter in the sixty-six books of the Bible which speaks of the Spirit in such a practical, rich, and thorough way as Romans 8. It particularly speaks of the Spirit and shows these four manifestations of the Spirit. Although we cannot know the Spirit by the Spirit Himself, we can know the Spirit through these four manifestations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BEING THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
(TOGETHER WITH THE LIFE OF GOD)<br />
MINGLED WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We all know that because life is in the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life. The Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God but the Spirit of God who has entered into our spirit, and the two spirits have been mingled as one; that is, the Spirit of God has been mingled with the spirit of man. Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit; this means that the two spirits have been mingled together. Life is in this spirit, and this spirit is the mingling of the two spirits.</p>
<p>What then is the Spirit of life? There are three elements in the Spirit of life: the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and the life of God; the three are one. We can use juice made from concentrated fruit syrup as an illustration. Water can be likened to the human spirit; the syrup, which closely resembles water, can be likened to the Spirit of God; and the sugar in the syrup can be likened to God&rsquo;s life. When we mix syrup into water, the sugar element in the syrup is also mixed into the water; thus, the syrup becomes sweetened fruit juice. Similarly, when the Spirit of God enters into our spirit, the life of God in the Spirit of God also enters into our spirit; thus, a three-in-one spirit of life is formed.</p>
<p>This three-in-one spirit is the mingling of the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and the life of God. When this life gives us certain feelings, we sense the presence of God; that is, we sense freshness, liveliness, strength, power, brightness, holiness, and reality. When this life in the three-in-one spirit gives us the sense of the presence of God, it gives us a sense of the Spirit. When this life gives us a sense of freshness, liveliness, strength, power, brightness, holiness, and reality instead of vanity, it gives us a sense of the Spirit. When we touch these positive feelings and conditions, we touch the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE BEING<br />
ONLY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We have said that the soul is a distraction to the spirit. Each of the three parts of the soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;can be a distraction to the spirit. Since fellowship is of life and life is in the spirit, we must be in the spirit if we desire to learn the lesson of fellowship, because fellowship is only in the spirit. If we desire to have the fellowship of life, we need to be in the spirit.</p>
<p>After the fall, man has been living in the mind, emotion, or will but not in the spirit. We do not live in the spirit. The majority of those who are saved, not to mention the unbelievers, still live in the mind most of the time. We are dominated by our mind; we say and do whatever our mind thinks. Our walk is under the domination of our mind, and our entire person is living in the mind. Thus, we are not in the spirit. Hence, our mind is a distraction to the spirit. When we live in our mind rather than our spirit, we lose the fellowship, because fellowship is only in the spirit.</p>
<p>Some saints live in their mind most of the time, and sometimes they live in their emotions, that is, in their joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, not in their spirit. They live according to their emotion, not according to their spirit. Therefore, our emotions also can be a distraction to the spirit. When we live in our emotion, we are not in the spirit and therefore lose the fellowship.</p>
<p>There are a good number of people who live in their will, deciding and determining according to their will. Such people cannot live in their spirit. Therefore, the will can be a distraction to the spirit. Those who live in their will certainly lose the fellowship. We must not live in any of these three places&mdash;the mind, emotion, or will. Once we are in our mind, we lose the fellowship; once we are in our emotion, we lose the fellowship; and once we are in our will, we also lose the fellowship. Only by living in our spirit can we touch the fellowship, because fellowship is of life, and life is in the spirit.</p>
<p>We must learn the basic lesson of turning from the mind to the spirit, from the emotion to the spirit, and from the will to the spirit. We must learn these three &ldquo;turnings&rdquo;: turning from the mind, turning from the emotion, and turning from the will to the spirit. This means that when our mind is taking the lead, we need to turn to our spirit in order to allow the spirit rather than the mind to take the lead and have the first place. When our emotion is active and wants to control our being, we need to turn to our spirit so that our emotion loses its ground. We should not allow the emotion to have the first place. Instead, we need to turn to our spirit rather than being subordinated and controlled by the emotion. In the same way, when our will takes the lead to control our being, we immediately need to turn to our spirit and allow the spirit to have the first place.</p>
<p>This is a basic lesson which requires our constant learning and exercise; we need to turn our being from the mind, emotion, and will to the spirit. Whenever our mind is activated, we need to turn to our spirit. Whenever our emotion begins to operate, we need to turn to our spirit. Whenever our will makes a decision, we need to turn to our spirit. We must bear in mind that if we are in our mind, emotion, and will, we definitely are not in our spirit. Once we are not in our spirit, we lose the fellowship. If we desire to live in the fellowship constantly, we need to turn to our spirit all the time. This is to continually live in the fellowship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SOUL<br />
TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOUL VERSUS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The soul is versus the spirit, and they are absolutely two different things. Whenever we live in the mind, emotion, and will of the soul, we cannot live in the spirit. Romans 8 points out clearly that the flesh is versus the spirit. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; First Corinthians 2 shows that the soul is versus the spirit. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.&rdquo; A soulish man has no understanding or desire for spiritual things; he regards them even as foolishness. Only a spiritual man can discern all things. He is not only desirous of spiritual things, but he is also able to discern them. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 2 clearly shows that the spirit and the soul are absolutely two different things.</p>
<p>A person who lives in and by the spirit is a spiritual person; he can comprehend, discern, and understand the spiritual things of God. If a person lives in and by the soul, he may be well-behaved and good in the world&rsquo;s eyes, but he has no understanding or even desire for spiritual things; rather, he abhors and rejects them and regards them even as foolishness. Therefore, while those who are fleshly are not spiritual, even those who are soulish are not spiritual.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FLESH VERSUS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When Romans 8 speaks of the flesh, it links the flesh with sin and death. Sin is the root, and death is the issue. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; Romans 8 deals with the problem of sin because this chapter is the continuation of chapter 6. Chapter 6 speaks of how a person can be freed from sin, and chapter 8 shows that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. Verse 6 says that to set the mind on the flesh is death. This means that to set the mind on the flesh is to sin, and the result is death. When Romans 8 speaks of death, it emphasizes its connection to sin; hence, to be freed from the flesh is to be freed from sin.</p>
<p>Romans 8, a continuation of chapter 6, speaks of how one can be freed from sin and not commit sin. When Romans speaks of setting the mind on the flesh, its emphasis is on the connection between flesh and sin. In order to be delivered from sin, we need to be delivered from the flesh; in order to be delivered from the flesh, we must live in the spirit. To live in the spirit is to set the mind on the spirit, and to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace (8:5-6). This means that if we live in the spirit, the spirit will free us so that we can be delivered from sin; this is the center of the book of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FLESH VERSUS THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING A MATTER OF COMMITTING SINS,<br />
AND THE SOUL VERSUS THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING A MATTER OF<br />
NOT KNOWING THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When Romans 8 speaks of the flesh, it emphasizes the connection of the flesh to sin and the flesh being a matter of committing sins. When 1 Corinthians 2 speaks of the soul, however, it does not mention the problem of sin; rather, it speaks of knowing spiritual things. Romans 8 tells how a person can be delivered from sin, and its emphasis is on the problem of sin. It also speaks of the flesh, so it further emphasizes the flesh being joined to sin. First Corinthians 2 speaks of understanding spiritual things, knowing the things of God, serving God, and touching the things of God. According to this chapter, the soul is absolutely incompetent, completely ignorant, and without any understanding, appreciation, or desire concerning spiritual things and service to God; it even considers them foolish.</p>
<p>This shows that the soul does not know or desire spiritual things and regards them even as foolishness. Only the spirit can understand spiritual things, and only spiritual persons can discern the things of God. Romans 8 shows that in order to be delivered from sin, we must live in the spirit, not in the flesh. First Corinthians 2 shows that in order to understand spiritual things, we must live by the spirit, not by the soul.</p>
<p>Being soulish is not a matter of whether we commit sins. We should not consider that a person is not soulish if he does not sin. A person may not sin and may be proper before man, but he can absolutely be a soulish person. In regard to the matter of being soulish, 1 Corinthians 2 never speaks of sin. Sin, however, is spoken of in Romans 8 and Galatians 5 in relation to the flesh. Being fleshly is related to committing sins. The sins listed in Galatians 5 are the works of the flesh; hence, sin is particularly related to the flesh. A person who commits sins and indulges in lust is fleshly. But if, instead of committing sins and indulging in lust, a person is proper and perfect in the eyes of men and even desires to serve God and to touch and understand spiritual things, he can still be soulish if he is completely ignorant of spiritual things and lives according to his soul rather than his spirit.</p>
<p>A soulish person in 1 Corinthians 2 is not a person who does not sin but one who does not understand the things of the Spirit. Although he does not live by the flesh, neither does he live by the spirit; he is living in the place in between, that is, in his soul. He lives in the soul, and although he does not sin, he has no understanding concerning spiritual things. He does not live by the flesh, but neither does he live by the spirit; he is one who lives in the soul.</p>
<p>The flesh versus the spirit is a matter of committing sins. The soul versus the spirit is a matter of not knowing the things of the Spirit. A person who lives by the flesh is bound to commit sins, and a person who lives by the soul may not sin, but he certainly does not understand the things of the Spirit. We must live by the spirit in order not to sin on one hand and to know the things of the Spirit on the other. Those who are of the flesh commit sins and do evil things; however, soulish ones may not commit sins or do evil things, but they are still ignorant in regard to spiritual things. A spiritual man, however, does not sin on one hand and knows the things of the Spirit on the other hand. Both Romans 8 and 1 Corinthians 2 speak of the matter of being spiritual. The focus in Romans 8, however, is on being delivered from sin, and the focus in 1 Corinthians 2 is on understanding spiritual things. In Romans 8 being spiritual is versus being fleshly; in 1 Corinthians 2 being spiritual is versus being soulish.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;GOOD&rdquo; BEING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT<br />
FROM &ldquo;SPIRITUAL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A person who lives by his soul may be good, proper, and nice, but he does not understand or desire spiritual things. I have met quite a number of brothers and sisters who do things cautiously and can be considered blameless in their conduct, but regarding spiritual things they are absolutely ignorant and have no pursuit. Their assessment of themselves and others is based on the ethical standards of good or evil and right or wrong. In every matter and toward everyone they lack the spiritual feeling and insight of God. They may have a clear mind and be very rational, but they are unclear in their spirit and dull in their feeling. Humanly speaking, they are truly good. They know how to behave and how to handle things, and they are also intelligent, efficient, diligent, and thoughtful. However, regarding the spiritual things of God, they have no discernment, feeling, or understanding. Moreover, they are often indifferent to spiritual things and are not only slow in understanding them but also slothful in pursuing them. Therefore, a good Christian may not necessarily be a spiritual Christian. A spiritual Christian is not merely a good person but one who lives in the spirit, has the feeling of the spirit, understands spiritual things, and knows the way of God inwardly.</p>
<p>Being good is very different from being spiritual. Many saints are good but not spiritual; they are good, but they do not live in the spirit. Others can sense their goodness, but they cannot sense the spirit; they can see their virtues, but they cannot smell the flavor of God. They do not appear fleshly, but they are soulish. Although they do not indulge themselves in the flesh, they do not live in the spirit either. Although they do not live in sin, they live in the self. Although they do not approve of sinful things, they do not desire spiritual things. Although they do not sin according to the flesh, they live by their soul. Their soul is the source and means of their living. They live in and by the soul, and they are of the soul. Therefore, they neither desire nor comprehend spiritual things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOULISH MAN</h2>
<p>In the soul there are three different parts: the mind is the part related to thought, the emotion is the part related to love, and the will is the part related to choosing. If we meet a person who is directed by the mind, the most prominent part of his being will be his mind, his thought, and his intellect. Although he is not without emotion, his emotion is not as prominent as his mind. In contrast, a person who is directed by his emotion is often confused and unreasonable. When others reason with him, he becomes emotionally aroused. A proverb says that a thousand reasons are not as powerful as a teardrop. If we desire that he be moved, all we need to do is shed a tear. With only one tear his heart is touched. A person who is not rational in this regard will always act according to his emotion. Most sisters are directed by their emotion. Lastly, a person who is directed by the will is very strong in his decisions. Once he has determined a course of action, no one can change him. Such a stubborn person can be very unreasonable and obstinate. A stubborn person is definitely a person of the will.</p>
<p>All these kinds of people are soulish. Whether they are directed by the mind, the emotion, or the will, they are soulish as long as they are directed by any of these three faculties. This is because the mind, emotion, and will are the three major parts of the soul. If we desire to learn to discern the spirit from the soul, we must have an accurate sense of the things that are related to the mind, emotion, and will. Is our mind the source of our every action, thought, or preference? Is our emotion the source? Is our will the source of our actions, thoughts, or preferences? If any of these three parts is the source, we are soulish men who live in the soul, not in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL MAN</h2>
<p>A person who lives by the spirit is a spiritual man. A spiritual man does not take the mind, emotion, or will as his source. Rather, he turns to the innermost part of his being and takes its sense as his source. His living, action, and work are all derived from this innermost sense. His innermost sense should have the most important position, the leading position; it should direct his mind, emotion, and will. He should consider the sense of life in his spirit as the principal source and his mind, emotion, and will in his soul as the means of expressing the source. In other words, his inner sense is the dominating factor, and his mind, emotion, and will are merely supportive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
BEING SOULISH AND BEING SPIRITUAL</h2>
<p>Since man is an emotional being, some saints who work for the Lord use emotions to touch people according to their emotion. For example, a brother whom we serve may be very quiet. It may be especially difficult for him to talk with us because it seems that he does not have a good feeling about us. Consequently, we may buy him a Bible with gold trim. Out of concern that this may not be enough to move him, we will add a deluxe edition of <em>Streams in the Desert</em> and a hymnal of selected hymns. Since man is an emotional being, he will be moved, and his emotion will be stimulated. Instantly, emotion becomes the dominating factor between us, but if emotion becomes preeminent, we will have no sense of peace and rest deep within.</p>
<p>According to our emotion, we may have a feeling to give people a Bible, <em>Streams in the Desert,</em> or a hymnal because they are good books. However, once we touch a person&rsquo;s emotion in this way, he will fellowship and contact us by his emotion. As a result of this kind of fellowship and contact, we also will fall into our emotion. At some point, however, we may sense that we are only in our emotions rather than loving one another and fellowshipping in the Lord. This sense deep within is the sense of our spirit. This feeling exposes that even though we care about this brother, we are indifferent toward other saints. If we say that we are short of strength and can be touched only by the problems of one brother, this shows that we are in our emotions.</p>
<p>When we contact the saints in our emotion, there may be a deep feeling which makes us uneasy as our spirit rises up to protest and object. As our spirit rises up, we may also become clear that our spirit is &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; and weakened when we pray, even though it seemed &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; when we contacted and fellowshipped with the saints according to our emotion. The more we fellowship with the saints in our emotion, the more our emotion will be nurtured and strengthened, and the more our spirit will be dried up and weakened. Consequently, when we pray before the Lord, we will not have the strength, and our spirit will be &ldquo;deflated.&rdquo; When a ball does not have enough air, it will not sound right when it bounces. Similarly, when we pray, those who have some spiritual sense know whether our spirit is fully &ldquo;inflated.&rdquo; This is the difference between being emotional and being spiritual, between living according to the emotion and living according to the spirit.</p>
<p>Problems with the mind are evident mainly among the brothers because they often have a strong will and logical thinking. When brothers desire to do a certain thing, they can argue one way or another, and both ways can seem reasonable. Since either way seems sensible, it is easy to decide to proceed. However, when we proceed, there can be a disapproving feeling deep within us. Although the way seems reasonable according to observation and analysis, deep within us we can sense that something is not right. This feeling deep within is the feeling of the spirit. At such a time, we should take care of this sense rather than our reasonings. If we care about our reasonings rather than our sense within, we will nullify our spirit and live in our soul. However, if we care only about the sense deep within, we will live in and by the spirit. As a result, we will live not in ourselves but in God.</p>
<p>This shows that regardless of the condition of our emotion or mind, neither one should have the preeminent position. They should only support the sense in our spirit. We must learn to give preeminence to the sense in our spirit. For example, someone may have determined what message to deliver and how to organize and present it. However, when he is about to speak, he may sense within that something is not right, even to the point of needing to change to another topic. At this moment, he should not follow his original consideration and decision; instead, he should follow the sense in his spirit. If he ignores the inward sense and follows his original consideration, he will be denying the spirit and living in the soul.</p>
<p>I hope we can see that our emotion, mind, and will are outward; only the spirit is inward. Our emotion is often contrary to the sense deep within, our will is often different from the sense deep within, and our mind often opposes the sense deep within. Therefore, we need to give the highest position, the first place, to the sense in our spirit deep within us. We must be willing to put aside the emotion, mind, and will of the soul. In our daily living and even in our walk, we must first touch the sense deep within. This is to turn to God and to the spirit because God as the Spirit dwells in our spirit.</p>
<p>God makes known His intention to us through the intuition in our spirit. Hence, we should not look merely at the outward situation, but we should also bring the outward situation before God and turn to our spirit to touch the sense of God. Turning to God, experientially speaking, is to inwardly turn so that we can focus on the spirit as our inward part rather than on our outward observations and environment. Although we will have thoughts in our mind and feelings in our emotion about a certain matter, we still need to turn to our spirit. We should not let our emotion, mind, and will dominate our being; rather, we should let the sense in our spirit be the leading factor. We must exercise to discern the spirit from the soul.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO TURN FROM THE SOUL TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The fellowship of life is in the spirit because fellowship is of life, and life is in the spirit. Before we are saved, we lived in the soul, that is, in the mind, emotion, and will. We cannot be separated from the soul; our very person lives in the mind, emotion, and will. However, the fellowship of God is in our spirit. Therefore, in order to touch the fellowship and learn to fellowship, we need to turn our being from the mind, emotion, and will to our spirit.</p>
<p>How do we turn from our will to our spirit? A certain saint may decide to go to Bangkok, but even though this decision has been made, he should be willing to let go of it and not insist. As he turns to his innermost part, prostrating himself before God and quieting himself, he should not think about Bangkok or his decision. Instead, he should simply turn from his will to his spirit to touch the sense of his spirit. Thus, he will learn how to turn from his will to the spirit to touch the feeling of the spirit in this matter specifically. If there is a sense in his spirit to go to Bangkok, that will be very good; however, if the spirit has another feeling, he must learn to let go of his decision, turn from his will, and obey this inward sense. This is not a simple lesson, but it is a lesson we need to learn throughout our entire life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTER MAN DECAYING AND THE INNER MAN<br />
BEING RENEWED DAY BY DAY</h2>
<p>The matter of turning to the spirit to fellowship with God, or we can say the matter of living in the fellowship and living in the spirit, is not a matter that we can learn by simply making up our minds. There is a need for the hand of God to break our being outwardly; that is, there is a need for the Spirit of God to arrange the outward environment to break and consume our being. The word <em>consume</em> comes from 2 Corinthians 4:16, which says, &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>decaying</em> may also be rendered &ldquo;being consumed.&rdquo; Although our outer man is decaying and being consumed, our inner man is growing and being renewed day by day. This consuming is the breaking. <em>Decaying</em> in verse 16 is God&rsquo;s dealing in verses 8 through 11.</p>
<p>In verse 7 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God.&rdquo; We all know that <em>earthen vessels</em> refers to us; we are made of clay and are earthen vessels. <em>Earthen vessels</em> does not refer merely to our body but to us; <em>this treasure</em> refers to God and His life, that is, Christ and His life. <em>We have this treasure in earthen vessels</em> means that we have Christ in us, that is, in our inner man. Our inner man is Christ; our outer man is we ourselves. Hence, verse 16 says, &ldquo;Our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; This means that while we are being broken by God, Christ is being built up in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOUL BEING THE OUTER MAN<br />
AND THE SPIRIT BEING THE INNER MAN</h2>
<p>The outer man, physically, is our body; psychologically, it is our soul. The outer man is our soul, that is, our self. The outer man being consumed means that our self is being consumed; that is, our mind, emotion, and will are being consumed. A brother may have a great intellect, a strong mind, and clear thinking, but all of these can frustrate the pneumatic Christ in him. Hence, God will raise up an environment to deal with his mind and thought; this is the tearing down. Before he was dealt with by God, his thinking was always sharp, and his clear mind could reason out everything. But when he comes under the hand of God, the outcome is always a mess even though his thoughts are right. This is God&rsquo;s striking him in the environment. He thinks that it is good to do things in a certain way, yet the result is altogether a mess. He thinks that he will be successful if he does things in a certain way, yet it turns out to be a complete failure. This is God&rsquo;s striking and tearing down of his mind with His hand.</p>
<p>We should not think that this is a simple matter. Some people are smitten severely in God&rsquo;s hand. Such a dealing tears down his mind to the extent that when he encounters another matter, he does not dare rely on his mind. This can be compared to the situation of Jacob. At one time his legs could run very well; moreover, he had a mind that was able to think of many ways to fight and supplant. His mind was clever, resourceful, and full of schemes. One day, however, God met him and dealt with him severely, touching his hip and crippling him (Gen. 32:25). After this, Jacob could no longer run. This is the breaking. Some people who are intelligent and have a very clever mind use their mind in spiritual matters. Such ones do not know how to touch the feeling of God, nor do they know how to live in the spirit rather than in their mind. Instead, they allow their mind and intellect to take the lead in everything. When God begins to deal with them, especially with their mind and intellect, they may become confused and scared, and they lose their confidence in their thinking ability. When they encounter similar situations in the future, their spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position. With respect to their mind, their outer man is torn down, but their inner man is being renewed.</p>
<p>In the same principle, God strikes our emotion to the extent that it fails us, and we no longer have any confidence in it. At such a time, our spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position and have preeminence over our emotion. It is the same with our will. God&rsquo;s striking and tearing down are a very painful process. Even the apostle Paul was no exception.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7-12, Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; The treasure is Christ who is in us, the earthen vessels. When God raises up an environment so that we are pressed on every side and cast down, the death of Jesus begins to operate in us. The word <em>death</em> in Greek does not refer to an ordinary death; it means &ldquo;killing, putting to death.&rdquo; For someone to be put to death is for him to be put into a situation of constantly being killed.</p>
<p>A sister may love her daughter very much, but she loves only with her emotion. If God desires this sister to grow in spirit, He must stretch out His hand to deal with her emotional love for her daughter. This is a putting to death, a killing. We also may be very clever, relying on our mind in everything we do, rather than the spirit. Consequently, God will raise up one situation after another to kill our cleverness. This is a genuine experience, and it is not only painful but also long lasting. However, Paul says that the putting to death of Jesus operates in us so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</p><h2 class="head1">SUFFERING AFFLICTIONS BEING<br />
UNRELATED TO SINNING BUT BEING<br />
FOR THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2>
<p>God uses the environment to strike, break, and deal with us repeatedly in order to break our self&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;so that His life can be added into us and manifested more from us. Suppose a brother is facing many difficulties: his family suffers much affliction, and even the brothers and sisters around him trouble him. It can be said that he is facing difficulty on all sides. Some may think that this brother has sinned and offended God; otherwise, he would not have so much suffering. When we see someone being smitten and disciplined, the first thing that comes to our mind is that he must have done something wrong and must have sinned. This kind of thinking may not be right.</p>
<p>Job did not suffer because he had sinned. Job did not sin, but he suffered very much. His suffering involved more than the matter of trying him. God desired to tear down the natural Job. When Paul became an apostle, he was greatly used by the Lord and was such a help to others. However, based on 2 Corinthians, we know that he suffered a great deal. His sufferings were not related to sin; however, if he had not sinned, why did he suffer so much? His outer man was torn down by God through sufferings so that his inner man, the spirit in him, could grow and be renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ABLE TO DISCERN THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL<br />
ONLY THROUGH GOD&rsquo;S BREAKING</h2>
<p>Trying to discern the soul and the spirit merely on the basis of our feeling is not a reliable method. We often feel that we are not in the soul but in the spirit. However, it is not until God comes to break us that we realize that we live mainly in the soul. This is true not only concerning our daily living but also concerning our spiritual work. A certain saint may receive a burden to go to a certain place to preach the gospel and establish the church. In making decisions regarding the gospel work, he prays, denies himself, and endeavors not to rely on his mind, emotion, and will but to learn to be led by the Lord to live in the spirit. At a certain time, he may feel that he is very much in the spirit, that his desire to work for the Lord by preaching the gospel and establishing churches is truly according to the spirit, and that this desire has been initiated by God, not by himself. Thus, he begins to carry out this work. However, he still encounters failures and difficulties as God raises up sufferings from every side to trouble, afflict, wound, and strike him. God will break him little by little. When God&rsquo;s breaking work is almost complete, he will realize that there is very little element of God in his so-called gospel work. Only then will he realize that he has actually been living in his soul most of the time, not in his spirit.</p>
<p>It is not possible to discern the spirit from the soul merely by listening to a message or by praying for a certain amount of time. It is only through God&rsquo;s breaking that one can truly discern the spirit and the soul. When God comes to break us, He tears down our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;our outer man. Following this, we will see that we rarely live in our spirit and, instead, live most of the time in our soul. Even though we may not sin, offend God, or rebel against God, we still live in our self, not in God. We may feel that we live in God, but in fact, we are living in ourselves. If we have not passed through God&rsquo;s breaking, our real situation cannot be exposed.</p>
<p>A person may say with boldness and assurance that what he is doing is absolutely of God and according to the will of God and that nothing is of his own will, choice, preference, and inclination. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s hand will come to discipline, strike, and break him. Consequently, he may become sick, and his work cannot be carried out successfully. At such a time, his whole being is put to the test. After passing through God&rsquo;s striking and breaking, he should have a deep understanding within that what he originally thought was of God was completely of himself. Only through breaking can we know the matter of the spirit and the soul.</p>
<p>We are people who have fallen deeply into the self. If we try to make up our mind to not be in our self based merely on doctrines, this will not work. If we resolve to be delivered from our self merely by praying a little, this will also be useless. God&rsquo;s hand must come in to strike and break us until there is nothing left to be stricken and broken and until we are hopeless. Then our true condition will be exposed. Only then will we see whether our work is of God or ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOUL NEEDING TO BE BROKEN<br />
FOR LIFE TO GROW</h2>
<p>Those who have not been broken have very little real spiritual constitution. This does not depend on what we do or how much we pray. We may even fast and pray every day, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want myself. I want You. I do not want to live by the soul, but I want to live in the spirit.&rdquo; This will avail nothing. I am not saying that we should not pray, but we must discern our spirit and soul. It is not enough simply to pray. God&rsquo;s hand must come in to break us. If brass is mixed with gold, how can we differentiate between them? We cannot differentiate gold from brass with our eyes alone. We cannot tell the difference even by touching them. The only way is to put the object into the fire. Once it is tested by fire, the situation is clear. In order to discern between gold and brass, we only need to put them into the fire. The mixture of the soul and the spirit is much stronger than a compound of brass and gold. It is quite difficult to differentiate a compound of brass and gold, but it is even more difficult to differentiate between the soul and the spirit. It is not through messages or prayers that we can be clear and understand the difference between them. We must wait until God&rsquo;s hand comes to strike and break us so that we can realize that what we think is of the spirit is actually of the soul.</p>
<p>For this reason, those who truly love and pursue the Lord have no way to avoid sufferings. We often have a wrong concept that if we love the Lord and please Him, we will not have sufferings and will have only peace and prosperity. But actually, this is not the case. It seems that the more a person loves the Lord and lives in the Lord, the more he suffers. There are many testimonies of this throughout church history. The more a person loves the Lord, is simple toward the Lord, pursues the Lord, and lives in the Lord, the more he seemingly suffers. This is because God desires to break the outer man and build up the inner man; He desires to break the soul so that the spirit can grow.</p>
<p>Trying to differentiate between the soul and the spirit by ourselves will not succeed. This is not possible. When we pursue God, love Him, and are willing to give ourselves to Him, God&rsquo;s hand will come in to do a breaking work, a work of breaking our earthen vessel. God breaks our earthen vessel, our outer man, so that the treasure in us can be manifested even more, and so that the God, Christ, the spirit, and the new man can grow and be renewed day by day.</p>
<p>In the church today there is truly a lack of people who can supply others. In other words, there is a lack of people who are broken. It is not possible to edify others merely with many messages. Doctrines can never edify people; rather, a person who is broken and torn down by God can edify people and minister to them. This is the work of ministry, not the work of gift. After a person is repeatedly smitten, broken, and torn down by God, his mind, will, and emotion are bankrupt and no longer have any power. Only this kind of person can enable Christ to be strengthened, the spirit to be renewed, the inner man to grow, and the treasure to be manifested. At this time, Christ will be able to be released through him in order to supply people and to supply the church; the spirit can be released so that the church may receive life. Only this kind of person can be delivered from the soul and live in the spirit. Second Corinthians 4 is entirely related to the breaking of the outer man and the growth of the inner man; this is for our deliverance from the soul in order to live in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE LIVES</h1>
<p>There is a crucial truth in the Bible related to three lives and four laws. If we desire to clearly understand the condition of our inner spiritual life or if we desire to be freed from sin so that we can lead an overcoming life, we must have a thorough understanding of this basic truth. There are three lives within every saved person. First, there is man&rsquo;s life, which is the created life of man. Second, there is Satan&rsquo;s life, which is the life man received because of the fall. Third, there is God&rsquo;s life, which is the life man receives at his salvation. These three lives&mdash;the life of man, the life of Satan, and the life of God&mdash;exist simultaneously within a saved one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF THE THREE LIVES</h2>
<p>These three lives originated in three great events that happened to man: creation, the fall, and salvation. Before his fall in the garden of Eden, Adam was created by God; thus, God&rsquo;s creation was the first great event. Tempted by Satan, man then ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and became fallen; thus, he received Satan&rsquo;s life. This was the second great event. These two great events&mdash;creation and the fall&mdash;are part of the history of every person. A third great event, however, happened to the believers; this great event is salvation through which God&rsquo;s life enters into the believers.</p>
<p>These three great events within a believer have brought in three different lives: the created human life, Satan&rsquo;s life, and God&rsquo;s life. The created life of man comes from the breath of God (Gen. 2:7), Satan&rsquo;s life comes from Satan, signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (v. 9), and God&rsquo;s life comes from the Son of God (1 John 5:12). When man received the breath of God, he obtained the created human life. When he received the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he obtained Satan&rsquo;s life. When he believed and received the Son of God, he obtained God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Coming forth from the creating hands of God, we were created; thus, we have man&rsquo;s created life. Passing through Adam, we became fallen; thus, we have Satan&rsquo;s fallen life. Entering into Christ, we were saved; thus, we have God&rsquo;s uncreated life. The three prepositions&mdash;<em>from, through,</em> and <em>into</em>&mdash;in these three simple sentences involve many complicated stories.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONFLICT IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</h2>
<p>In the garden of Eden there is a picture of three parties: man, represented by Adam, God, represented by the tree of life, and Satan, represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. With Adam standing before the two trees, the three parties were in a triangular situation. Both God and Satan want man. God desires man for the accomplishment of His will, and Satan wants man for the fulfillment of his evil intention. God&rsquo;s way is to gain man through life. This is also Satan&rsquo;s way. God&rsquo;s intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be joined to Him. However, Satan enticed man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, causing man to obtain his fallen life and be mixed with him instead. Hence, the garden of Eden is a story of the conflict between God and Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOCATION OF THE THREE LIVES</h2>
<p>The created life of man is in man&rsquo;s soul, the fallen life of Satan is in his body, and the uncreated life of God is in his spirit. When man was created, God breathed the breath of life into him, and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). Therefore, man&rsquo;s created life is related to his soul. When man fell, he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan, and received it into his body. Strictly speaking, Satan&rsquo;s life came into the human body and caused the body to become flesh. When we believe in the Lord, we receive the Lord as our life in our spirit; thus, the Spirit comes into our spirit, and we have the life of God in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to clearly understand the three parts in which these three lives are located, we must look at the consciousness of the three parts of man&mdash;the spirit, soul, and body. The body as the outer, physical part of man is visible and tangible, and it enables us to contact the external, physical world. Hence, the consciousness associated with the body is called physical consciousness. The spirit, the deepest and innermost part of our being, is the part of our being associated with a consciousness of God, and it enables us to contact God and have fellowship with Him. Hence, the consciousness associated with the spirit is called spiritual consciousness or God-consciousness. The soul, situated between the spirit and the body, is our psychological part, which includes the mind, emotion, and will, and it enables us to contact the psychological world. Hence, the consciousness associated with the soul is called psychological consciousness or self-consciousness. Physical consciousness enables us to sense things outside the body, self-consciousness enables us to sense ourselves, and God-consciousness enables us to sense God. The body has physical consciousness to contact things outside the body, the soul has self-consciousness to sense the things of the self, and the spirit has God-consciousness to deal with God and sense the things of God.</p>
<p>The physical body includes five sense organs related to seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching. The spirit has two sense organs&mdash;conscience and intuition. Although the spirit consists of the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, fellowship is not related to a sense. Only conscience and intuition are related to sense. Therefore, the spirit has sense organs related only to the conscience and intuition. Although the soul also has three parts, consciousness is related only to the mind and emotion. Hence, the soul also has only two sense organs. The created life is in our soul, having sense organs related to the mind and emotion, which are known simply as self-consciousness. Satan&rsquo;s life is in our body, which includes the five senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching. These senses are called physical consciousness. God&rsquo;s life is in our spirit, which has sense organs related to conscience and intuition. The sense associated with these two is called God-consciousness. The three lives are located in these three parts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE AND CONDITION<br />
OF THE THREE LIVES</h2>
<p>The life of man was originally innocent and simple, without knowledge of sin, because after man was created, he was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s eyes (1:31). Therefore, the created life of man was originally good and upright. It was without sin or even the knowledge of sin, and it had no consciousness of shame. It was innocent and simple. Satan&rsquo;s life, filled with all kinds of sins, contains seeds of corruption and factors of evil. The nature of God&rsquo;s life is holy and good. Thus, these three lives possess three absolutely different natures: the nature of man&rsquo;s created life is good and upright, Satan&rsquo;s fallen life is evil and corrupted, and God&rsquo;s divine life is holy and good.</p>
<p>How many lives did Adam have in the garden of Eden? What kind of living did he have? In the garden of Eden Adam had only one life, that is, the created human life, and he led a good and upright living. In fact, before Adam sinned, he did not have any consciousness of good or evil. According to the biblical record, Adam was good and upright. At that time, his eyes for good and evil were not yet opened. He did not know of evil or even of good. Although he was good and upright, he had no sense of goodness and uprightness. In the garden of Eden Adam had the created human life, and his living by this life was good and upright, but he did not have a sense of uprightness and goodness, nor did he have a sense of evil. He was simply there living his life in an innocent and simple way. In God&rsquo;s eyes he did not have sin, nor did he know sin.</p>
<p>After the fall of man, man began to have two kinds of life&mdash;man&rsquo;s life and Satan&rsquo;s life, that is, the created life and the fallen life. With these two lives, his living became a mixture of man and the devil. Sometimes we live like a man and sometimes like the devil. The Chinese often refer to opium addicts, alcoholics, lustful persons, and habitual gamblers as &ldquo;smoking devils,&rdquo; &ldquo;drinking devils,&rdquo; &ldquo;lustful devils,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gambling devils.&rdquo; There is a certain truth to this. After the fall, man has two kinds of lives, so he can live out two kinds of living. At times these two kinds of living are mixed together. At one moment a man can be gentle and good, looking like a proper man, but a minute later, he can lose his temper and become violent and ugly, looking like the devil. Then a minute later he can repent, confess, and express God. Within a short period of time, man, the devil, and God are all lived out through him.</p>
<p>The man God created was the best and the fairest. In response to Satan&rsquo;s temptation, man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted. Consequently, man&rsquo;s inner being has become a place where man and the devil are mixed, and man&rsquo;s living is a mixed living of man and the devil. Chinese philosophers throughout the ages have been divided into two schools&mdash;one advocates that man is born good and the other stresses that man is born evil; the contention between the two schools is very intense. Actually, human nature is both good and evil because within man there are elements of good and elements of evil. Therefore, both schools are right, but both are incomplete because they are only half right.</p>
<p>After the eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there is not only human goodness and uprightness but also satanic corruption and evil within man. There are two different lives with two different natures within man. When the good nature is active, he has a so-called &ldquo;sense of mercy,&rdquo; which is goodness; when the evil nature is active, he has thoughts related to sin and does evil things. For example, honoring our parents is a manifestation of our good nature, but losing our temper and rebelling against our parents are manifestations of the evil nature within us. Thus, both good and evil are in us. This is man&rsquo;s condition before he is saved.</p>
<p>What is man&rsquo;s condition after he is saved? Is a man more complicated before he is saved or after he is saved? A saved person has three different lives: man&rsquo;s life, the devil&rsquo;s life, and God&rsquo;s life; hence, he can have three different kinds of living. When he expresses his goodness, he is like a man. When he lives out the sinful nature, he is like the devil. When he manifests the divine holiness and goodness, he is like God. We can say that the situation in the garden of Eden is present within a saved person. In the garden of Eden there was a triangular situation&mdash;man, Satan, and God. In a saved person there is also man, Satan, and God. Within us we have man&rsquo;s life, Satan&rsquo;s life, and God&rsquo;s life; this is a triangular situation. There is a conflict between God and Satan in us. Whenever we cooperate with God, we are victorious, but whenever we cooperate with Satan, we fail.</p>
<p>The triangular situation in the garden of Eden has been completely transferred into man. Once the garden of Eden was outside of man, but now it is present in the believers. The story of the garden of Eden occurs in us daily. Within us is the tree of life as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God desires that we eat of the tree of life, but Satan entices us to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If we follow Satan and eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we will fail, but if we live in the fellowship of life and eat Christ as the tree of life, we will overcome. This story is enacted in us daily.</p>
<p>This should not be regarded merely as a doctrine; rather, we need to understand it thoroughly and apply it in our spirit. Then we will realize that we have man&rsquo;s life, Satan&rsquo;s life, and also God&rsquo;s life in us. These three lives are in us. When we learn to live before God, we need to discern whether we are committing a sin by following Satan, doing a good deed in ourselves, or cooperating with God through fellowshipping with Him.</p>
<p>We have seen clearly that there are three different lives in us&mdash;the created life, the fallen life, and the divine life. We also have three different kinds of living because of these three different lives&mdash;a good and upright living, a sinful living, and a divine living. The concept of a natural man is that Christians should have a good rather than a sinful living. Actually, Christians should not have merely a good living; even more, they should have a divine living. Even unbelievers can have a good living in themselves. The only difference is that they neither know God nor have the life of Christ. Christians should have a living that is not only good but also divine; that is, they should live out not merely goodness, but even more, God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION IN MAN<br />
BEING TO LIVE OUT GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>The ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation in us is for us to have God Himself as the goal, not goodness. His desire is not for us to stay away from evil and be good; instead, His desire is that we would stay away from both good and evil and live out God Himself. He does not desire for us to merely reject a heart of hatred and live out a heart of love; rather, He desires for us to reject both a hating heart and a loving heart and live out God Himself. When God is lived out, spontaneously there will be a heart of love. Not every heart of love is God Himself, but when God is lived out, love is definitely lived out, because God is love. Gold is yellow, but not everything yellow is gold. Likewise, God is love, but not every kind of love is God. People in the world express love, but their love is not God. The love that Christians live out from their spirit is God. If God desired for us merely to be delivered from evil and be good, we would not need to reject ourselves, nor would we need to die to ourselves. However, God&rsquo;s desire is that we would be delivered not only from Satan&rsquo;s evil but also from our own goodness. We must therefore reject ourselves. We must reject not only the evil life of Satan but also our good life in order to live in the divine life of God.</p>
<p>Christians should not live by their good life just as they should not live by Satan&rsquo;s evil life. Christians should live only by God&rsquo;s divine life. Hence, God demands that we reject and deny ourselves (Matt. 16:24-25) just as we reject and deny Satan. We need to learn to deny ourselves in the same way that we deny Satan. We also need to learn to reject our life of doing good in the same way that we reject Satan&rsquo;s life of doing evil. We need to reject our good thoughts as well as our evil thoughts. Both must be rejected because God does not desire for us to live by our good thoughts, just as He does not want us to live by our evil thoughts. Instead, He desires for us to live by His divine life. If an unsaved person tried to deny himself and to reject Satan, he would have nothing to live by and thus could not live. However, if a believer rejects Satan and denies himself, God will still have ground in him, and God will be lived out from within him.</p>
<p>To reject Satan and to deny our self is the experience of the cross. To put our self to death in order to allow God the opportunity to live out of us is resurrection. Death and resurrection are the basic experiences of a Christian. The death of the cross is related to losing the life of man. When we lose our human life, the evil life of Satan with which we have been involved will be lost automatically. Once we die, we are delivered from our own life as well as from Satan&rsquo;s life. We are delivered from both lives. At such a moment, God&rsquo;s life in us will have the opportunity to be lived out of us; this is resurrection. The life that is lost is our human life together with the satanic life. The life that is resurrected is God&rsquo;s life, the life of God lived out of us.</p>
<p>Hatred toward the brothers is the manifestation of Satan&rsquo;s life, but our intention to love the brothers is a manifestation of our own life. Just as we need to reject our hatred of the brothers, we also need to deny our intention to love the brothers. Some may say that this is very dangerous. If we reject both our hatred and our love, will anything be left? In fact, it is only at this juncture that God&rsquo;s life has the opportunity to be lived out of us. When we reject Satan&rsquo;s life and its thoughts of hatred and when we also deny our own life and its thoughts that originate from our own love, we will practically experience the death of the cross; that is, we will be standing in the place of death to allow God&rsquo;s life to be lived out of us. When we reject Satan&rsquo;s life and also our own life, we are standing in the place of death, putting ourselves to death by the Holy Spirit. We do not want evil, nor do we want good; rather, we have come to the place of death. A dead person neither hates others nor loves others, nor can a dead person commit sins or do good. It is at this point that God can be lived out of us.</p>
<p>Christians need to arrive at a point where they have been put to death, being able to neither commit sins nor do good. At this time, there will be resurrection. Death brings in resurrection. Where there is death, there is resurrection. Death involves the loss of man&rsquo;s life, but resurrection involves the living out of God&rsquo;s life. When we come to the place of death, God is resurrected. When we depart, God comes in, and when we are terminated, God is germinated. When we do not know love or hatred and cannot do good or do evil, God is lived out, and God&rsquo;s life will come out from within us. When God&rsquo;s life comes out from within us, there will be a gushing forth of a great measure of love, a great measure of goodness, a great measure of humility, and a great measure of meekness. What gushes forth will be a fountain of living water. This is not something we work out; instead, it is God Himself being lived out of us.</p>
<p>The inner being of a believer is quite complicated. In order to have a living that is up to standard, Christians need two levels of rejection. We need to reject Satan&rsquo;s life, and we also need to reject man&rsquo;s life. We need to reject evil and also to reject good. Unbelievers need only one level of rejection. By rejecting the life of the devil and living by their own life, they can be decent and proper persons. But Christians not only need to reject the satanic life; they also need to reject their own life. We not only need to reject evil but also to reject good; we need to reject both good and evil. We must have these two levels of rejection so that God&rsquo;s life, the life on the third level, can be lived out of us. The goal of a Christian is not to be a good man but to be a God-man. <em>Goodness</em> is not the goal of Christians; <em>God</em> is the goal of Christians. People in the world take goodness as their goal, but Christians should take God and Christ as their goal.</p>
<p>Learning the fellowship of life is not about living a life of goodness but living the life of God, the life of Christ. When we touch the fellowship of life, we are not in the realm of evil or in the realm of good; we are in Christ. We need to see that good and evil stand together and are on the same tree. Both good and evil are versus life. When we learn to fellowship in life, we do not reject evil and follow good; instead, we reject both good and evil to follow the inner life and live the divine life in us.</p>
<p>As soon as a person is saved, it is easy to have a concept about rejecting evil and pursuing good. They naturally think of rejecting evil and living out good. However, we must remember that whenever we pay attention to goodness, we are not in God but in ourselves; whenever we pay attention to goodness, we fall into ourselves. When we pay attention to love, to virtues, or to goodness, we fall into ourselves. Once we fall into ourselves, the fellowship of life ceases. In order to learn to fellowship and to deny ourselves, we must deny ourselves in relation to not only evil things but also good things. It is only at this point that we can practically stand in death, having the experience of death, so that God can come in and be lived out of us. It is at this moment that we can touch God in our fellowship. Then what we live out will be a living in fellowship, a mingled living of God and us. In the flow of God&rsquo;s life, we have a life of fellowship that is based on neither the evil of Satan nor the good of man but rather on the life of God being lived out of us; this is the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes so that we can truly know that His life in us is the treasure we have received. We need to learn to know God&rsquo;s life and to live in this life. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may touch His way and know the way of life. We need to ponder all these matters point by point and calmly remain in a spirit of prayer to touch the proper way of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOUR LAWS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF THE FOUR LAWS</h2>
<p>Three lives and four laws are the foundation of the spiritual experience of Christians. The three lives are the life of man, the life of Satan, and the life of God. Now we need to consider the matter of the four laws. What are the four laws? Where are they recorded in the Bible? The four laws are recorded in Romans 7 and 8. These two chapters, which specifically speak of the matter of law, refer to four different laws: the law of God, the law of good in the mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>The law of God (7:22, 25), referring to the law in the Old Testament, is God&rsquo;s requirement on us. The law of good in the mind (v. 23) gives us a desire to do good. &ldquo;The law of sin which is in my members&rdquo; (v. 23) causes us to commit sins. Finally, the law of the Spirit of life (8:2) enables us to live in the life of God. Of these four laws, one is outside of us&mdash;the law of God. The other three are inside of us&mdash;the law of good in the mind, the law of sin in the members, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF THE FOUR LAWS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of God</h2>
<p>The law of God, written on stone tablets, was given by God to men through Moses in the Old Testament. The other three laws are derived from the three lives we have spoken of earlier. We know that with every life there is a law. Since we have three different lives within us, we have three laws corresponding to these three different lives.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of Good in the Mind</h2>
<p>The law of good in the mind is derived from the good created life, which was obtained not at the time of our salvation but at the time of our physical birth. It is a natural endowment in God&rsquo;s creation, not a gift in God&rsquo;s salvation. It was created in God&rsquo;s creation, not given in God&rsquo;s salvation. It is not weighty enough simply to say that we have the law of good in our mind through birth. We need to say that it is a natural endowment in God&rsquo;s creation. The law of good in the mind was given to us when God created us. Hence, it is a natural endowment in God&rsquo;s creation, not a gift in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>When God created us, He gave us a life that is good. Even though this good life was defiled by sin, it did not lose its good elements and become evil. If it had become evil, then Chinese sages and philosophers like Confucius and Wang Yang-ming would not have been able to discover the so-called &ldquo;bright virtues,&rdquo; &ldquo;innate consciousness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;innate ability&rdquo; in man. Based on Romans 7:18, which says, &ldquo;In me...nothing good dwells,&rdquo; many Christians, both in the East and the West, conclude that absolutely nothing good dwells in us. When I was young, I was affected by this teaching, thinking that nothing good dwelt in me. However, deep in my being, I did not agree with this teaching, because even though there was evil in me before I was saved, I was not without any goodness.</p>
<p>Therefore, I spent much time to study the book of Romans. I discovered that when Paul says, &ldquo;In me...nothing good dwells,&rdquo; he also adds, &ldquo;that is, in my flesh.&rdquo; This indicates a particular realm. Thus, <em>in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells</em> means that nothing good dwells in our fallen flesh; it does not mean that nothing good dwells in our entire being. In fact, after verse 18 we can still see that there is an element of goodness in our mind (vv. 19, 21-22).</p>
<p>Nothing good dwells in our flesh, but in our soul, there is still an element of goodness. Since we have the good life in our soul, we have the law of good in our soul. With every life there is a law, and the law of a particular life always corresponds with the nature of the life. Since the nature of our good life is good, the function and nature of its law are also good; hence, this law is the law of good. Although our good life has been damaged and defiled because of the fall, it cannot be damaged and defiled to the point of obliteration. For example, a glass may be smashed, but the broken pieces are still glass. Sometimes we cannot do the good that we desire, because even though we have the good life, this life has been damaged and made powerless. Our willingness to do good proves that we have the element of goodness in our being; our inability to do good proves that the element of goodness in our being has been damaged.</p>
<p>In the light of God, we can see that the good we live according to the life of God is absolutely different from the good in our created life. However, Christians today mix up the two. Some people say that before we were saved, nothing good dwelt in us, but since we have been saved, the good that we try to do is from God, from the life of God. This is truly dangerous. This will cause us to focus on the goodness in our natural life as the intrinsic content of our spiritual life and to regard the small amount of good that we can do in ourselves as goodness that comes from the life of God.</p>
<p>We must point out to people that before we were saved, we had a life of good. Although this life has been defiled and damaged, its good element still exists. Very often, we desire and endeavor to do good, yet we cannot work it out. This is because the power of our life has been damaged and made powerless. Not only this, but before we were saved, we desired to honor our parents, help others, show mercy toward others, and perfect others, but our honoring of our parents, our help, our mercy, and our love contained pride and impurities; they were not pure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in fallen man, the good from creation is present. If we did not have any element of good before we were saved, we would all be like poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Before we were saved, there was truly an element of goodness in us. However, this goodness was not clean and pure; rather, it was filthy inwardly. It is only after we are saved that we can genuinely pursue the growth of life and live in fellowship. Through this we can learn to reject the good element in us. The life that we live after we are saved should be absolutely out of God, not out of ourselves. We should reject both evil and goodness because neither is out of the spirit or of God.</p>
<p>Some saints are humble by nature. Although this natural humility is not fake, it must be rejected just as hatred must be rejected. We need to condemn and abhor our humility just as we condemn and abhor our pride. Some saints are forbearing even before they are saved. After they are saved, they become &ldquo;forbearing&rdquo; Christians. In the past, they applied their forbearance to their social life; now they apply their forbearance to their coordination and service. When they serve, they never argue with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Very often, we simply apply spiritual terms to the goodness of our natural life and regard it as being spiritual. This can be compared to putting a label saying &ldquo;Made in the U.S.A.&rdquo; on Japanese products and considering them American products. Christians recognize the &ldquo;label&rdquo; but not the &ldquo;product.&rdquo; Hence, we are not able to discern between the goodness that comes out of our natural life from that of the life of God. When I was first saved, I was fervent in preaching the gospel and bringing people to believe in Jesus. One day I preached the gospel to an elderly friend of mine. He said, &ldquo;Do not ask me to believe in Jesus. I have a bad temper. If I believe in Jesus, I will put your church to shame. If another person who is gentle in his temperament and proper in his character becomes a Christian, he will bring glory to the church.&rdquo; Many saints &ldquo;bring glory to the church&rdquo; because they are good by nature. They bring their natural goodness to the church. They not only treasure but also continue to develop their natural goodness. Little do they realize that this is merely &ldquo;a label of spirituality,&rdquo; not genuine spirituality. We need to be clear about what is of the natural life and what is of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Before we are saved, we have the element of goodness within us. This is the reason Chinese sages and philosophers were able to discover &ldquo;bright virtues,&rdquo; &ldquo;innate consciousness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;innate ability.&rdquo; Although the natural goodness in man has been damaged, it can never be annulled. Nevertheless, we must admit that nothing good dwells in our flesh. Our flesh is the body that has been transmuted by the addition of the life of Satan. God created our body, and the flesh is the body created by God that has the added element of Satan&rsquo;s life. The body has been transmuted into the flesh, and lust dwells in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of Sin in the Members</h2>
<p>The law of sin in the members is derived from the evil and sinful life of Satan. When the life of Satan entered into us, it brought in a law also. The nature of the life of Satan is evil and sin. When this life entered into us, strictly speaking, it dwelt in our body, in each of our members, that is, in every part of our body, and it manifested its functions and capabilities. Hence, this law is called the law of sin in the members.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The law of the Spirit of life is derived from the life of God. Because the nature of the life of God that enters into our spirit is life, the nature and functions of its law are also life. Hence, it is called the law of the Spirit of life. This law is of the Spirit of God, and it is also in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOCATION OF THE FOUR LAWS</h2>
<p>The law of God is written on the tablets of stone; hence, it is outside of us. The law of good is in our mind, that is, in our soul. The law of sin is in our members, that is, in our body. The law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Human beings have three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Each part is related to a particular life. The created life of man is in the soul, the fallen life of Satan is in the body, and the life of God is in the spirit of every believer. Since the three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;each have their own life, they also have their own law. In our spirit we have the law of the Spirit of life from God, in our mind we have the law of good given through God&rsquo;s creation, and in our body we have the law of sin from Satan. Our being is not simple. We have three persons&mdash;God, man, and Satan&mdash;with three lives&mdash;the life of God, the life of man, and the life of Satan&mdash;in our three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;with three natures&mdash;life, good, and evil.</p>
<p>Today God, man, and Satan with their three lives dwell in our spirit, soul, and body respectively. Hence, we have the life of God, the life of man, and the life of Satan in us. Each of these lives has its own law: the law of God&rsquo;s life, the law of man&rsquo;s life, and the law of Satan&rsquo;s life. The law of God&rsquo;s life enables man to live out the divine life, the law of man&rsquo;s life prompts man to do good, and the law of Satan&rsquo;s life causes man to sin. The natures of the three laws reflect the natures of the three lives. The nature of God&rsquo;s life is life, the nature of man&rsquo;s life is good, and the nature of Satan&rsquo;s life is evil. These four groups of three&mdash;three parts of man, three persons, three lives, and three laws&mdash;require our proper understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF THE FOUR LAWS</h2>
<p>The first law is the law of God; its nature is holy, righteous, and good (7:12). The second law is the law of good; its nature is good, and it matches the nature of the law of God outside of us. The third law is the law of sin in the members; its nature is evil, and it is in opposition to the law of God and incompatible with the law of good in our mind (v. 23). The fourth law is the law of the Spirit of life; its nature is life (8:2).</p>
<p>Within fallen human beings there are two contradictory laws. One is derived from the created life of good; this is the law of good in our mind. The other is derived from the fallen, evil life of Satan; this is the law of sin that operates in the members of our body, causing us to commit sins. These two laws war against each other. This is what the Chinese call &ldquo;the war between reason and lust.&rdquo; Reason is the law of good in the mind, and lust is the law of sin in the members. In an unbeliever there is a war between reason and lust. Reason is related to the intellect, the mind, and lust is related to the flesh. In other words, there is a war between our soul and our flesh.</p>
<p>After smoking opium, every addict always regrets his actions. He will often say to himself, &ldquo;I am truly a wretched man! Smoking opium ruins my body, my family, and my future. Why am I like this?&rdquo; With his intellect thus awakened, he will determine in his mind to quit smoking opium. This is the law of good operating in his mind. However, after a period of time, the craving for opium will stir up his body. Since he cannot suppress it, a war breaks out, and he will be taken captive and smoke opium again. The same pattern can be seen in the matter of losing one&rsquo;s temper. After a person loses his temper, he will have regrets and make up his mind not to lose his temper again. This is the operation of the law of good in his mind. However, when he is offended at a later time because of a certain matter, his flesh will be stirred up, especially if others are speaking negatively of him. Eventually, his temper will explode. This shows that there is a constant warring between the law of good in our mind and the law of sin in our members.</p>
<p>These two laws in us are constantly warring against each other, but the law of sin always overcomes the law of good, causing us not to do the good that we desire but rather to do the evil that we hate (7:18-23). But thank the Lord that there is still another law, which is the law of the Spirit of life in us (8:2). This law is derived from the life of God, that is, from the uncreated, divine life of God. Because this life is the strongest life, the power of this law is also the strongest. This law not only keeps us from obeying the law of sin, but it also enables us to obey its law and live out God.</p>
<p>The strength of a law is according to the strength of its life. A strong life has a strong law; a weak life has a weak law. Thus, the three different laws in us are different in strength. The life of man is the weakest, the life of Satan is stronger, and the life of God is the strongest. The law of good derived from the life of man is the weakest, the law of sin derived from the life of Satan is stronger, and the law of the Spirit of life derived from the life of God is the strongest. Hence, every time the law of good wars against the law of sin, the law of good is always defeated. However, when the life of God comes in, the law of the Spirit of life is able to overcome the law of sin and of death.</p>
<p>Romans 8:2 says that if we live by the law of the Spirit of life, we can be freed from the law of sin and of death; that is, we can overcome the law of sin and of death. In the garden of Eden, Adam had only the life of man but not the life of Satan or the life of God. One day, however, Adam took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and fell. In the fall, Adam did not simply make a mistake; rather, he allowed the life of Satan to come into him. Thus, today we not only have the law of good that comes from the life of man but also the law of sin that comes from the life of Satan. Outside of us the written law of God demands that we honor our parents and love others as our self, and the law of good echoes an Amen within us. However, the law of sin in our members rises up to oppose the law of good in our mind and causes us to fail continually. Eventually, with a sense of condemnation, we cry out, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; (7:24).</p>
<p>This is the story in Romans 7 and 8. Whenever the law of God demands, the law of good in us echoes its approval, but at the same time, the law of sin interferes. Those who are not saved can never keep or fulfill the law of God because they do not have the law of the Spirit of life. But Paul could say, &ldquo;Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!&rdquo; (7:25).</p>
<p>When the life of God comes in, it comes with a higher and stronger law, that is, the law of the Spirit of life. This law is stronger than the law of good in man and also the law of sin in Satan. This law enables us to transcend and break through the law of sin, and it sets us free and delivers us from the law of sin and of death. The Spirit of God with the life of God is a powerful life in man, enabling man to do good. It not only fulfills the outward requirement of the law but even transcends the requirement of the law.</p>
<p>When we see this, our whole being will be subdued, and we will never again rely on the law of good. When we walk according to the Spirit, the Spirit will set us free and save us. We do not need to will to do good (v. 18). As long as we walk according to the Spirit, we will be freed from the law of sin and of death (8:2). We do not need to expend any energy in this regard; rather, the life of God spontaneously will enable us to soar, to transcend, to overcome, and to break through the bondage of the law of sin and of death. This indeed is a salvation that is living, powerful, and of life; it is a salvation that we can experience subjectively. But regrettably, many children of God do not know this law. They still endeavor to do good and improve themselves; they think that through more prayer they can become stronger so that they can do good. May the Lord have mercy on us to show us the wonderful way of deliverance that He has given to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF<br />
MAN&rsquo;S IMPROVEMENT OF BEHAVIOR</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s way of improving his behavior is by developing the good life he received through creation, but God&rsquo;s way of deliverance is by His Spirit and life. Throughout the centuries, in the East and in the West, man has attempted to improve his behavior by developing the element of good in man and by dealing with the lusts in the flesh of man. All religions and forms of moral cultivation are focused on these two aspects. For example, Hinduism practices the severe treatment of the human body. Sometimes Hindus walk on hot iron so that they can forget their lusts through suffering; others sit on spiked chairs when their lusts are aroused in order to deal with their lusts through suffering. They ill-treat their body in order to deal with their lusts. They also use various methods to cultivate their conscience, to develop their &ldquo;bright virtues.&rdquo; On the one hand, they cultivate the element of goodness in their soul, and on the other hand, they try to restrain the lusts in their flesh. These are the two efforts in religious and moral cultivation; these are also the methods used by man for the improvement of behavior.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING<br />
TO WORK HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>The way of God&rsquo;s salvation is different. God saves us by enlivening our deadened spirit with His Spirit and His life. When our spirit is enlivened, He spreads from our innermost being to renew our soul; eventually, when the Lord comes again, He will renew our body, working His element into us from the inside out. This is different from the behavioral improvement of man. The most that man&rsquo;s behavioral improvement can attain is a high level of goodness that has no element of God. God&rsquo;s salvation is not to make us good men but to make us God-men who live out God&mdash;God mingles Himself with us and lives out from us. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation does not take goodness as the goal; rather, it takes God Himself as the goal. God&rsquo;s salvation is not to work goodness into man but to work God Himself into man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBEYING THE SENSE OF LIFE TO LIVE OUT GOD</h2>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s salvation is for us to live Him out, we must live in Him. Saying that we must live in God seems vague. Precisely speaking, God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship in spirit, that is, they must contact Him in spirit (John 4:24). We use our mouth to eat food and our eyes to see colors; we must use our spirit to worship and contact God. To live in God, man must live in the spirit. Specifically, living in the spirit is to walk according to the law of the Spirit of life; to walk according to the law of the Spirit of life is to follow the sense of life within.</p>
<p>First, we need to live in God; second, we need to live in the Spirit; third, we need to follow the law of the Spirit of life; and fourth, we need to follow the sense of life. Sense is related to what we can touch and feel. God is Spirit. In the Spirit is the law of life, and in the law of life is the sense of life. If we desire to live in God, we must live in the Spirit. If we desire to live in the Spirit, we must live in the law of the Spirit of life. If we desire to live in the law of the Spirit of life, we must live in the sense of life. When a doctor examines a patient to determine his illness, he must search methodically to find the source. Life is the content of the Spirit, and the law of life is the function and operation of the Spirit; in other words, the law of life is the manifestation of the Spirit. These points are all related.</p>
<p>This is similar to light being the manifestation of electricity. Electricity is invisible, but it has a manifestation. Similarly, although the Spirit is intangible, He has some manifestations. The law of the Spirit of life is the greatest manifestation of the Spirit, but the law of the Spirit of life is contained in the sense of life. By its function and operation, the law of the Spirit of life provides us with a sense of life. These matters are being explained in great detail so that we may learn the lesson of spiritual fellowship in a proper way. I hope that we can all be calm before the Lord and learn to touch these fine details.</p>
<p>When the Spirit of God regulates us inwardly, we have some feelings. The fact that we have feelings means that we have touched the operation of the Spirit. When we touch the law of life, we touch the Spirit, who is God. We touch the law of life through our inner sense; hence, when we obey the inner sense, we obey God. When we constantly live in the sense deep within, we live in God. The top Christians are those who obey the sense deep within. When the inner sense moves, they move. When the inner sense stops, they stop. When the inner sense agrees, they go forth. When the inner sense disagrees, they stop. Their living and work, their message and prayer, and their contact and conversation with others are all according to the inner sense. All the great and small things in their living are according to the inner sense. To obey the inner sense is to obey the law of life, to obey the law of life is to obey the Spirit, and to obey the Spirit is to obey God. In this way, they live in God, in the Spirit, and they move according to the law of the Spirit of life. At a certain point, what they live out is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Our living is not according to the law of good but according to the law of the Spirit of life. We do not take goodness as our goal; rather, we take God, Christ, and the Spirit as our goal. We take the Triune God as our goal. Ultimately, what we live out, what we express, and what people touch and sense from us will be life, which is God Himself. This is the way of life.</p>
<p>Those who have touched the way of life advance and progress in life rapidly. But those who have not touched this way, even though they speak about spiritual matters and seemingly pursue spiritual progress, are merely going around and around without much growth. We need to learn to obey the inner sense of the Spirit of life in a simple way. Instead of making resolutions and exerting effort, we need to cease our efforts. When God comes to shine on us and give us revelation, we need to stop our being; we need to stop our desire and effort to do good. When we completely stop, God has an opportunity to spread Himself in us. In this way, the law of the Spirit of life within us will operate and manifest its functions, and we also will be full of spiritual feelings.</p>
<p>We should obey and walk according to the inner sense. Then we will live out and work out God Himself, not our goodness. The purpose of a Christian is to be a God-man. This is God&rsquo;s salvation, and this is also the goal that God desires to attain in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS<br />
CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S CREATION OF MAN</h2>
<p>There are two important matters concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man. First, when God created man, He gave him only the created human life; He did not give man His life which is the uncreated life of God. When God created man, the life He gave to man, apart from the angelic life, was the highest created life, but He did not give man the uncreated life of God.</p>
<p>Second, although God did not give man His uncreated life, He created man with a spirit as an organ to receive God so that man might receive Him as life. These are the two important matters concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>God created life for man, but He did not give man His own life; however, He prepared a spirit in man as an organ to receive Him. This is similar to our stomach being an organ to receive food. If we did not have a stomach, it would be impossible for food to enter into us; hence, God created a stomach so that we can receive food. In like manner, we have a spirit as an organ for receiving God, that is, for receiving the life of God. Please remember that the life of God is simply God Himself. Regardless of whether we are speaking of God Himself or the life of God, He is the Spirit, and His life is the Spirit. Furthermore, the spirit within us is for us to receive the Spirit, that is, to receive the life of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE CREATED HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God created a spirit so that we can receive God. The spirit within us is an organ for receiving God. It is not only for us to have fellowship with God, but more importantly, it is for us to receive God into us. Just as our stomach is a receiving organ, our human spirit is also a receiving organ. Our stomach is for receiving food, and our spirit is for receiving the Spirit. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus likened Himself to food. Just as we take physical food into our stomach, we take the Lord Jesus as the heavenly food into our spirit, because the Lord Jesus, as the bread of life, is the Spirit. John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; We can receive the Lord Jesus into our spirit, because the Lord Jesus, as the bread of life, is the Spirit. In order to receive the Spirit, we must use our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT LOSING ITS FUNCTION<br />
AFTER THE FALL OF MAN</h2>
<p>Man fell soon after he was created. As a result of the fall, the spirit&mdash;the organ for receiving God&mdash;became deadened and lost its function. This is the most important point concerning man&rsquo;s fall. The meaning of a deadened spirit is that it has lost its function. To speak of the spirit being deadened does not mean that the spirit no longer exists; rather, it means that the spirit has lost its function. Originally, the function of the spirit was to receive God, but once the spirit lost its function, it could no longer receive God and fellowship with God. It lost its function toward God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION RECOVERING<br />
AND ENLIVENING THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The main point concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man is that God created a spirit within man in order for man to receive Him. Since the most important point concerning man&rsquo;s fall is that the spirit became deadened and lost its function toward God, the most important point regarding God&rsquo;s salvation is that He enlivens our spirit. The fall causes our spirit to be deadened, but God&rsquo;s salvation causes our spirit to be enlivened. When God created us, the most important point is that He created a spirit in us so that we could receive Him. However, Satan corrupted us and caused us to fall so that our spirit became deadened and lost its function toward God. The most important point concerning God&rsquo;s salvation is the enlivening of our spirit so that we can receive Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Negative Side,<br />
Taking Away the Sin of Man</h2>
<p>How does God enliven our spirit? On the negative side, He takes away the factor that caused our spirit to be deadened. Death is an issue of sin. Since death is the consequence of sin, sin is the cause of death. In order to resolve the problem of death, it is imperative that the cause of sin be taken away. Since the source and cause of death is sin, God sent the Lord Jesus to shed His blood for us on the cross so that our sins would be taken away and we would be cleansed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Positive Side,<br />
Causing Man to Have the Life of God</h2>
<p>On the positive side, God put His life into our spirit through His Spirit, who enlivened our deadened spirit. Now the Spirit dwells in our spirit so that our spirit is not only enlivened but also strengthened. We not only have the Spirit but also the life of God. In other words, our deadened spirit is not only enlivened, but the element of God&rsquo;s life has also been added to it. Thus, even though we were created without the life of God, we now have God&rsquo;s life in our spirit.</p>
<p>Some Christian teachers say that salvation is being recovered to our original condition before the fall. Is it correct to say that salvation means recovering what Adam lost, that is, recovering man to his original condition before the fall? Many speak, preach, believe, and receive a kind of teaching that suggests that Adam only stumbled and fell, dropping and losing everything he was carrying. Consequently, our salvation is spoken of in these terms. God&rsquo;s salvation is presented as a recovery of the things that were dropped when we stumbled and fell. In addition, our body is portrayed as if it were covered with dust when we fell so that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; salvation is viewed as removing the dirt on our body.</p>
<p>This matter requires careful consideration. When man was created by God, he did not have the life of God and the Spirit within him. Nevertheless, before the fall he was without sin, and his human spirit was living and unaffected by sin or death. In our salvation, the blood of the Lord cleanses us of our sins, and God enlivens our spirit, removing death and recovering us back to our original condition in creation before the fall. He has also put His life and Spirit into our spirit so that we now have an added element. I would like to ask: Which is better, the condition of Adam in the garden of Eden before the fall or our condition after our salvation? Our condition after our salvation is not merely the same as Adam&rsquo;s condition in the garden of Eden. Our condition is even better because we have a treasure that Adam did not have&mdash;we have the life of God and the Spirit in us. This is a very crucial point. Not only has our spirit been enlivened, but the life of God and the Spirit have entered into our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Renewing Man&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>When God enlivens our spirit, He also renews our heart. Our heart is related to the matter of desire, of <em>willingness</em>. Our spirit is related to the matter of power, of <em>ability</em>. If God merely regenerates and renews our spirit without renewing our heart, our spirit may be able to contact God, but our heart may not agree and be unwilling to do so. Therefore, at the same time that God regenerates us, He also renews our heart so that our heart will be willing to fellowship with Him and receive Him when our spirit contacts Him.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION STARTING FROM THE HUMAN SPIRIT,<br />
SPREADING TO THE SOUL, AND THEN TO THE BODY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation spreads from the inside to the outside. What is the process associated with this spreading? First, God enters into our spirit to enliven our spirit. Then He spreads to every part of our soul. Ultimately, He spreads to our body. God&rsquo;s salvation starts from the center and spreads to the circumference of our being. The spirit is the center of man, the soul surrounds the spirit, and the body is outside of the soul. When God comes to save us, He enters into our spirit. He enlivens our spirit in the center and then spreads outward from the center. When we throw a stone into water, ripples spread outward from the center to the circumference. God &ldquo;throws&rdquo; His Spirit, like a stone, into our spirit. Once the Spirit enters our spirit, the center of our whole being is stirred up and the life of God begins to spread outward until it reaches every part of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and eventually, it spreads even to our body. When the Lord Jesus returns, the spreading power of God&rsquo;s life will fully spread out of us. This will be the transfiguration of our body.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation involves three steps of renewing. The first step is to renew our spirit, the second step is to spread outward to renew our soul, and the third step is to spread even further to renew our body. At the time of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back, that is, at the time of our rapture and transfiguration, our body will be completely renewed. Hence, the renewing work in God&rsquo;s salvation is from the inside to the outside.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S WORK OF DESTRUCTION BEING<br />
FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE,<br />
FROM THE BODY TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When Satan comes to corrupt us, his work moves in the opposite direction of God&rsquo;s salvation. Satan first enters into our body and uses our body as the base, because lust is in our body. Romans 6 through 8 repeatedly speak of the corruption of the body. Chapter 6 speaks of the body of sin, and chapter 7 speaks of the body of death. The body of sin is actually the body of death. Our body is a body of sin and death because when man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his body was involved. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil entered into man&rsquo;s body, causing it to become flesh. In this mutated body, no goodness dwells.</p>
<p>When Satan enters into man, he enters into man&rsquo;s body and takes it as a base to invade from the outside to the inside by corrupting man&rsquo;s soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and then by further defiling man&rsquo;s spirit. As a result, man&rsquo;s spirit is deadened. God&rsquo;s salvation, however, works in the opposite direction by first entering into our spirit. God&rsquo;s salvation is from the inside to the outside, spreading from the spirit to the soul and then from the soul to the body. Every step of God&rsquo;s salvation is the opposite of Satan&rsquo;s work. If we desire to be in Satan&rsquo;s work, we do not need to do anything because we are already headed in the outward direction of the fall. But if we desire to be in God&rsquo;s work, we must turn to the spirit. This is a basic principle. Satan&rsquo;s attack is from the outside to the inside, and God&rsquo;s salvation is from the inside to the outside.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOURCE AND INITIATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The source of the law of life is the life of God, and the initiation of the law of life in us is regeneration. Both God&rsquo;s life and the law of life enter into us through regeneration. Hence, God&rsquo;s life is the source of the law of life, and regeneration is the initiation of the law of life. When we are regenerated, the Spirit puts God&rsquo;s life into our spirit. When this life begins to function in us, this function is the law of life. Hence, the source and initiation of the law of life is God&rsquo;s life, but the law of life enters into us through regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE AND LOCATION<br />
OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The significance of the law of life relates to the innate ability of life; that is, it is a natural law produced by the life in us. This law is different from the outward law of letters given by God. The law of life is living, but the law of letters is dead. If a tree is dead, it will not be able to fulfill any outward demand to be living, to grow leaves, to blossom, or to bear fruit. This is precisely our situation in relation to the Ten Commandments. The commandments require us to love others, to honor our parents, to do this and keep that, but all these requirements of the law cannot be fulfilled by &ldquo;dead trees,&rdquo; that is, by dead people. It is impossible for us to fulfill the requirements of the law because we are dead and powerless.</p>
<p>The outward law of letters was given by God on Mount Sinai; however, the situation was different on Mount Golgotha. Just as God can enliven a dead tree, He made it possible for His life to come into man on Mount Golgotha, enabling us to respond to a natural law. There is a law, an innate ability, within a living tree; thus, there is no need for human teaching. A living tree will eventually grow leaves, blossom, and bear fruit. Growing and bearing are the function of the living law within the tree. Through the redemption of the cross on Mount Golgotha, God is able to put His life into us. There is a natural law in God&rsquo;s life, and as long as the law of life is active within us, it will spontaneously live out the goodness and holiness of God. This is the law of life, which is based on an inner function, a natural law, not on outward regulation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SOURCE AND EXECUTOR<br />
OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The law of life is called the law of the Spirit of life in the Bible (Rom. 8:2). With regard to this designation, there is a special relationship between this law and God&rsquo;s life and the Spirit. God&rsquo;s life is the source of this law, and the Spirit is the Executor of this law. The life of God is the inner content of God, and the Spirit is the person of God. When referring to God&rsquo;s life the stress is on His nature, and when referring to His person the stress is on the Spirit. Hence, the law of life has God&rsquo;s life as its source and the Spirit as its Executor. The law of life is very strong because both God&rsquo;s life and the Spirit are strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE LAW OF LIFE<br />
IN THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<p>Human beings consist of three parts. In addition to the body without, there are also the spirit and soul within. In the spirit, there are the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, and in the soul, there are the mind, emotion, and will. Therefore, simply stated, our inner being consists of two parts&mdash;the spirit and soul. Stated in more detail, our inner being consists of six parts&mdash;conscience, intuition, fellowship, mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>Our heart is composed of four parts: the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. The mind is the thinking part of the soul, the emotion is the feeling part of the soul, and the will is the deciding part of the soul. Moreover, the heart also includes a part of the spirit, that is, the conscience. According to the record in the Bible, these four parts&mdash;the mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;are related to the heart (Prov. 2:10; Psa. 139:14; 1 Sam. 18:1; S. S. 1:7; Job 7:15; Heb. 10:22; 1 John 3:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEART BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF MAN</h2>
<p>The heart is a combination of the soul and the spirit, including all the parts of the soul and one of the three parts of the spirit. The three parts of the soul&mdash;mind, emotion, and will&mdash;are related to man&rsquo;s behavior, living, and actions. The conscience of the spirit is also related to man. The other two parts of the spirit&mdash;intuition and fellowship&mdash;are related to God, not to man. The parts related to God are not included in the heart. Only the part related to man, that is, the conscience, is included in the heart. Because the three parts of the soul are related to man, they are also related to the heart. The heart, therefore, is the representative of man. The major part of the heart is the soul, but only a small part of the heart is related to the spirit. These four parts together equal the heart, which is the representative of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE LOCATION<br />
OF THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Where in us did God put His life? God put His life into our spirit. When His life enters into our spirit, it produces a law, and this law spreads out from our spirit into every part of our being. When this law spreads to a certain part, it becomes the law of that part. Thus, there is a law in our conscience, in our mind, in our emotion, in our will, in our fellowship, and in our intuition. In each of the six parts of our inner being there is a law. Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the law within us, it often uses the plural form <em>laws.</em></p>
<p>There is only one law, but when this law operates and reaches a certain part of our inner being, it becomes the law of that part. This may be compared to electricity. When electricity, which is uniquely one, is transmitted into a microphone, it becomes the electricity of the microphone. When it is transmitted into a fan, it becomes the electricity of the fan. When it is transmitted into many rooms, it becomes the electricity of each room. On the one hand, the electricity is one, and on the other hand, it seems to be many. There is a law of life within us, and when this law operates and reaches the different parts of our being, it becomes the law of each individual part. These many laws, however, are only one law in actuality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT RENEWING OUR WHOLE BEING<br />
THROUGH THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>When the law of life enters into our mind, how does it become the law of our mind? When it enters into our emotion, how does it become the law of our emotion? When it enters into our will, how does it become the law of our will? God&rsquo;s work of salvation is accomplished by renewing us. When God regenerates us, He renews our spirit. He desires to spread outward from our spirit into our soul to renew the soul; this renewing work is carried out by the law of life. The law of life is the operation of the Spirit, a function of the Spirit; it is a function of the operation of the Spirit in us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE REGULATING OUR MIND</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit renews us inwardly through the operation of the law of life. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is through renewing us, and this renewing is fully accomplished by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit also enters into our mind through the law of life. Our mind was originally set on the things of the world, but through the operation of the law of life in our mind, our mind is being renewed and can be set on the things of God (Rom. 12:2; 8:6). Furthermore, whenever we set our mind on worldly and sinful things, the law of life within us causes us to feel uneasy because we have violated that law. The confusion in our mind comes from setting our mind on worldly things, sinful things, and fleshly things rather than following the law of life.</p>
<p>Our physical body feels pain and discomfort whenever it acts against the law of the body. If we did not act against the law of our digestive system in our stomach, we would not get a stomachache, nor would we even likely sense the operation of a law in our stomach. If our consumption of food, however, goes against the operating law in our stomach, our stomach will begin to ache. Similarly, our mind often is confused because many of our thoughts are against the law of life. If we would simply set our mind on God, on the spirit, and on spiritual things, our mind would be stable, focused, and submissive.</p>
<p>The law of life begins its operation from our spirit and advances to our mind, regulating our mind and activating our mind to function so that it can be set on the things of God and on spiritual things. If we cooperate with this law and set our mind on God and on spiritual things, our mind will be focused, calm, stable, and sober. However, if we set our mind on worldly and fleshly things, making provision for the flesh, we will be confused, our mind will be perplexed, and our whole being will be unable to remain calm.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE REGULATING OUR EMOTION</h2>
<p>According to the same principle, when the renewing Holy Spirit enters into our emotion, the law of life operates in our emotion and causes our emotion to spontaneously love God, incline toward God, and delight in God. If we do not go along with this law to love and incline toward God and instead love and incline toward other things, our emotion will be unsettled and unstable. Someone with an unstable emotion is often occupied with loving other things rather than allowing the law of life to regulate and cause him to love God. A young brother may ignore God because he is inclined toward marriage, even though the law of life is moving him to incline toward God, to love God, and to choose God. When we contact such a brother, we can sense that his emotion is unsteady and unstable. However, if we meet a young person who loves God with a pure heart and allows the law of life to regulate his emotions to love God, meditate on God, and incline toward God, we sense that his emotions are truly stable. When one cooperates with the regulation of the inner law of life, he will love God when the law of life requires him to love God. Since he does not have an opposite reaction or response, his inner being is at peace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE REGULATING OUR WILL</h2>
<p>When the law of life regulates our will through the renewing work of the Holy Spirit, there is a law in our will that spontaneously causes us to yield to God, to choose Him, to submit to His authority, and to obey Him. At such a time, our will is quite stable because we have obeyed this law. Sometimes, however, we may act contrary to the regulation of the law within. If we resist and reject it, we will become unpredictable and capricious, acting one way in the morning and another way in the evening. When we come in contact with a saint who acts one way in the morning and another way in the evening, who has one opinion today and a different one tomorrow, we know that such a person is not allowing the law of life to regulate his will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE BEING<br />
IN EVERY PART OF OUR SPIRIT AND SOUL</h2>
<p>If a person cooperates with the law of life in his mind, emotion, and will, he will be consistent inwardly and outwardly, harmonious, calm, and sober-minded; otherwise, his mind will be confused, his emotion will fluctuate, and his will will be unstable. We need to allow the law of life to regulate us from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will. When the law of life reaches one of the inner parts of our being, the function of that part will be manifested. When the law reaches our mind, it causes us to meditate on God. When it reaches our will, it causes us to submit to God. Furthermore, when it reaches our emotion, it causes us to love God.</p>
<p>In like manner, when the law of life enters into our intuition, it causes us to touch the sense of life. When it enters into our fellowship, it causes us to have fellowship with God. When it enters into our conscience, it causes us to have a sense of right and wrong in our conscience. The law of life is exceedingly sensitive. The moment our living is not so proper and not so pleasing to God, there will be a sense within our conscience. The conscience of secular people is dull because the law of life is not manifesting its proper function in them. Similarly, when the law of life reaches the thoughts in our mind, it causes us to meditate on God and on spiritual things. When it reaches our emotion, it causes our emotion to delight in God and love God. Moreover, when it reaches our will, it causes us to yield to God and submit to Him.</p>
<p>The life of God in our spirit works to regulate our mind, emotion, and will. Therefore, the law of life reaches every part of our inner being. The base of the law of life is in our spirit, and subsequently, it moves outward from our spirit to reach every part of our soul.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE HEART</h2>
<p>God takes our spirit as the base and spreads outward from our spirit through the law of life to reach every part of our soul. This is the relationship between the law of life and our spirit and soul. Moreover, there is also a relationship between the law of life and our heart. The spirit is the base and the location of the law of life, the soul is the location of the activities of the law of life, and the heart is the gateway, the switch, of the law. We can open our heart and let the law of life operate, and we can also close our heart and frustrate the law of life. In itself the law of life is unable to move; however, when our heart is open to God, the law is able to operate in us. In order for the law to move outward from our spirit, our heart must be open. The heart is a gateway. It is similar to a door. Once a door is closed, there is no way to enter or exit.</p>
<p>As those who are saved, we have opened our heart at least once. At that time the Spirit, the life of God, entered into our spirit. After coming into our spirit, however, He is often &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; by us and cannot spread out. When the Spirit is locked in our spirit, there is absolutely no way for Him to regulate the various parts of our soul. He can neither affect our mind nor regulate our emotion and will. We have the life of God in our spirit, but it seems that we do not have the life of God in our soul because our heart has locked the Spirit, the life of God, in our spirit. Therefore, we must continually open our heart and allow the Spirit, the life of God, to spread to our soul; this is to be revived. To be revived is simply to open our heart once again.</p>
<p>The heart is the gateway and switch to the life within us. At the same time, the heart can hinder the operation of the law of the Spirit of life. Since our heart is a switch, it can either release or hinder the Spirit. If our heart is unhappy and upset, it is impossible for the Spirit to move and be released. Therefore, we must exercise to open up our heart when we speak, fellowship, sing, and testify in the meetings, for only then can the Spirit be released. All the spiritual work of God requires man&rsquo;s cooperation. It is as if God and we are tied together in a three-legged race. We often think that God has chosen us to cooperate with Him, but regrettably, we are sluggish. It seems that He is so fast and that we have no way to catch up with Him, because we often stumble and fall. However, we fail to realize that the totality of man, the representative of man, is our heart. Even though we may say that we desire to cooperate with God, how do we cooperate with Him? We should cooperate with Him from our heart; our cooperation with God must begin with our heart. If our heart is not open, neither our fastness nor our slowness will be useful. If our heart is open, it does not matter to God whether we are fast or slow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEART COOPERATING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>A man&rsquo;s activities are altogether a story of the heart. The expression <em>absent-minded</em> means that the heart is inactive: a person eats without tasting, hears without understanding, and looks without seeing. God is Spirit, and He desires to enter into our spirit and spread out from our spirit. However, if our heart remains closed and does not cooperate with Him, God will have no way in us. Therefore, we need to learn to deal with our heart&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our mind needs to be sober and not confused, our emotion needs to be loving and not distracted, our will needs to be soft and submissive to God, and our conscience needs to be at peace without any feeling of condemnation. We need to learn to deal with our soul until our mind is sober and no longer wanders, until our emotion loves God and inclines toward God, until our will is soft and able to submit to God, and until our conscience is at peace without any feeling of condemnation. If we can deal with our heart in these four aspects until it is sober, loving, soft, and at peace, we will have a proper heart before God and be able to cooperate with God in the best way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO CONTINUALLY TURN<br />
TO TOUCH THE INNER SENSE</h2>
<p>If we have no desire or willingness to take this way, all the preceding fellowship will mean nothing. But if we have a desire to take this way and are truly willing to fellowship with God, touch God, know God in life, and give ourselves for this way, we must believe that this fellowship will guide us step by step. When we decide to take this way and have this kind of living, it is very crucial that we continually exercise to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>For example, we may have a thought to go to a certain place to preach the gospel, to visit a particular saint, or to do some other things. At this time, we must turn our mind to our spirit to touch the sense of the spirit. We should not let our mind make suggestions; rather, we should let the spirit make suggestions. We need to turn to the spirit and touch the inner sense. If we feel at ease in our spirit and sense the peace within, we can proceed.</p>
<p>When we love someone or something, our emotion is moved and our affection is stirred. However, we must still turn our love, our affection, and our being from our emotion to our spirit to touch the sense of the spirit. If our spirit agrees and is at peace, we should express this love, but if our spirit disagrees, we need to stop ourselves. There can be thousands of reasons that justify a decision to love, but if our inner sense does not feel comfortable and disagrees, we must stop ourselves. We should never allow outward reasons to defeat the inner sense. The same applies to the will. When we are making a decision about a certain matter, we first should turn to the spirit, put aside our decision, and touch the inner sense. If the inner sense is at ease, we can accept it, but if the inner sense is not at peace, then we should let it go.</p>
<p>This lesson is basic, and it requires learning and exercise. We should have this kind of exercise in the great and small matters in our daily living. When we are about to speak, we should turn within and touch the sense in our spirit. When we are making a decision, we should turn within and touch the sense in our spirit. When we are interacting with other people, we should turn within and touch the sense in our spirit. Even when we are reading the Bible, we need to turn within and touch the sense in our spirit and exercise to not merely use our mind while we are reading. When we are praying with the saints in the meetings or by ourselves at home, we also need to touch the sense in our spirit and not pray endlessly. We must put aside and forsake many things and turn to the inner sense. If we are those who always stay in an outward realm, most of our feelings will be outward when we get down on our knees to pray. We will pray for the trainings, for people, and for the work. When we get down on our knees, however, we must learn to draw ourselves back to our spirit and pray when there is a move within. If there is no move within, then we should not pray. Only prayer that comes out of the inner sense is what God desires. We need to labor on this and learn this serious lesson.</p>
<p>We need to stop all our activities and allow the Spirit the opportunity to move within us. If we are willing to learn this lesson, we will gradually discover that we need to die in many things. Death stops all our activities. We need to die in our dealings with the saints, we need to die to our preferences, and we need to die even in our Bible-reading and prayer. God will also raise up the environment to match our inner learning so that we will have the discipline of the Holy Spirit in us. He works in us from within and without, killing and terminating us again and again.</p>
<p>If we are willing to go on in this way, there will be more spiritual constitution within us as time passes. In our practical experience, we will be able to touch the work of the law of life in every part of our being. Only then will we know what is of the soul and what is of the spirit, only then will we discern the spirit from the soul, and only then will we live in the spirit, not in the soul, that is, not by ourselves but by God. Then we will be on the right track with regard to spiritual matters. In a strict sense, only then will our spiritual living truly begin.</p>
<p>If we think that someone is spiritual because he is zealous for the Lord, well-behaved, godly, and restrained and that he is one who endeavors to improve himself, to live a religious life, and to do good things, we are too shallow. We must realize that this kind of zealous, godly, religious life of self-improvement is merely soulish and man-made. It merely has the appearance of the living of a Christian. If our living is according to such zealousness and religion, focused not only on self-improvement but also on being godly and good, it can be said that we are living a religious life, not a spiritual life. Such a living comes out of knowledge and natural concepts, not from the life of God being lived out of us.</p>
<p>Through the constant exercise of turning to our spirit, we can gradually discern what is a good living of self-improvement, and we will see that this kind of living is altogether different from the living that comes from life. May the Lord bless us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS<br />
OF THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In order for the law of life to operate in us, we need to fulfill two requirements: loving God and obeying the initial sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Life of God Coming with Love<br />
and Being Full of Power</h2>
<p>Loving God is the first requirement in order for the law of life to operate in us. God&rsquo;s salvation is by His life, that is, by God Himself as power. God Himself is our saving power. His life is the power of our salvation. Amazingly, however, He desires to have the enjoyment of love with us. Therefore, it is not right if we only sense His power but not His love. Electricity is transmitted through power to light a lamp, but there are no emotions in the transmission of electrical power. In contrast, the life of God in us is full of emotion; thus, we enjoy not only power but also the love of God. It is wrong to enjoy only power but not love. The life of God comes with love, and the experience of His life depends on how much we love Him. This is a wonderful matter.</p>
<p>It is difficult for those who do not love God to enjoy the power of His life. The more a person loves God, the more he enjoys the power of His life. This is a wonderful two-way cycle. The more feeling we have toward God and the more we love God, the more His power can be expressed through us. In response to a deeper, higher, and greater experience of His powerful life, we love Him more and we have more feelings toward Him. This is because the life of God is not only a matter of power but also a matter of love.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Dwelling in Us Being a Story of Love</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love.&rdquo; Christ dwells in us; He dwells in our hearts, and this dwelling is a dwelling of love in us. This enables us to apprehend, to experience, and to taste the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ with all the saints (vv. 18-19). The meaning of <em>knowledge-surpassing</em>
 in Greek is &ldquo;beyond intellectual capacity.&rdquo; This love is beyond man&rsquo;s intellectual capacity. Our intellect cannot comprehend this love, but our emotion can touch this love. In other words, the Christ who indwells us is the very embodiment of love. His indwelling us is love; therefore, <em>that Christ may make His home in your hearts</em> equals <em>that love may make His home in your hearts</em>. Christ, who is love, not only dwells in us, but even more He dwells in our hearts and can touch our feelings.</p>
<p>On one hand, Ephesians 3:20 says that there is a power operating in us that can do superabundantly above all that we ask or think; this power is the resurrection life of Christ. On the other hand, it shows that the indwelling of this resurrection life, which is Christ Himself, is a matter of love. It speaks of Christ dwelling in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). Then it says that His dwelling in our hearts is a matter of love, enabling us to enjoy the power of the life of God, which can do superabundantly above all that we ask or think. Therefore, the Bible speaks of Christ&rsquo;s indwelling us as a matter altogether of love.</p>
<p>We should never consider that the God who dwells in us has no feeling or love. The God who dwells in us is the embodiment of love and is even love itself. The more He operates in us, the more He causes us to love Him and attracts us to love Him. He moves in our heart and touches our heart so that we may experience the power of His resurrection. Therefore, the end of Ephesians 3 says that the power of the law of life that operates in us is according to God&rsquo;s love within us. If there were no history of love, no traffic of love, and no fellowship of love between us and God, we would not have much knowledge of the life of God or much experience of the power of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Obeying the Initial Sense of Life</h2>
<p>Obeying the initial sense of life is the second requirement for the law of life to operate in us. As soon as we are regenerated and have the life of God, the law of this life causes us to have a certain sense. In the beginning, the sense of this law of life may be comparatively weak, but it will become stronger. We must obey the initial sense of life, even though it may be very weak, rather than a &ldquo;second&rdquo; sense of life. We should obey the initial sense every time. Strictly speaking, there is not a second sense, because God&rsquo;s leading is always in His initial sense, which is His only sense. This is similar to the fact that every day in our experience is a today; no one can live tomorrow&rsquo;s life today. Every tomorrow will become a today. Therefore, in our living, there really is no such thing as &ldquo;tomorrow.&rdquo; We would never say that we did something tomorrow; we can only say that we did something yesterday. <em>Tomorrow</em> is only a word; it is an expectation. For us, every tomorrow is actually a today. Thus, strictly speaking, we do not have a tomorrow.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s leading, the sense that God gives us, is always present in His initial sense. God never gives man a second leading. If God&rsquo;s leading was theoretical, there could be a first, a second, a third, and even a fourth leading. But His genuine leading is in our initial sense, and it is the one we need to obey. There is an initial sense but not a second one. We should obey God&rsquo;s initial leading and sense. This is the same as the days that we live. Every day is unique; we cannot live the same day twice. We must learn to be simple and faithful to the sense God gives us. When God gives us a sense, we simply need to obey it; we need to be faithful without any twisting, arguing, or reasoning.</p>
<p>We should obey the sense God gives us in simplicity. We should never think of our own benefits, wondering, for example, whether we will suffer loss if we obey by mistake. If we have this kind of thinking, we will not be able to obey. Obeying is not a matter of caring for consequences, but only of caring for the sense within. We should obey the sense we have within. We need to learn to be simple and faithful.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Love and obedience are two requirements for the operation of the law of life within us. If we are able to love and are willing to obey, the law of life will spontaneously operate in us and manifest its function. We must be clear that the life of God has two elements: one is death and the other is life. The element of death is produced out of the life of God that has passed through death. The Lord Jesus died on the cross and resurrected; although He dies no more, there is a divine mystery, one beyond our understanding, related to His death. When He passed through death, the element of death was added to His life. This element of death is a good element. We usually think of death as a bad thing. However, after the Lord passed through death, the element of His death was good. This can be compared to water that passes through a place with sulfur, causing the sulfur, a germ-killing element, to be added to it. Before the Lord passed through death, He did not have the element of death. After He passed through death, the element of death was in Him. This is a mystery. When we live in the life of the Lord, allowing the Lord&rsquo;s life to take effect in us, the element of His death will spontaneously do a killing work in us.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, we read in Romans 6:11 concerning reckoning ourselves to be dead. But no matter how we reckoned, we could not reckon ourselves to be dead. Rather, the more we reckoned, the more we were alive. Eventually, the Lord opened our eyes to see that the death in Romans 6 can become a fact only through the law of life in Romans 8. In Romans 6:8 the matter of our having died with Christ is only a doctrine, a fact to show that Christ has already accomplished a mysterious death in which we also died. However, if we try to use our own effort to believe and reckon that we are dead, we will be ineffective and destined to fail.</p>
<p>Romans 7 is a supplementary word between chapter 6 and chapter 8. Chapter 8 shows that our co-death with Christ in chapter 6 can be a reality only through the law of the Spirit of life. When the law of life regulates and operates in us, the element of death in the divine life spontaneously functions to kill our self and our flesh. This is the same as taking medicine. The germ-killing element in medicine kills germs through the circulation of blood; germs are not killed by our &ldquo;reckoning.&rdquo; Our own effort cannot produce any effect; rather, there is an element in the medicine operating within us through the circulation of the blood which manifests the medicine&rsquo;s effect. Regardless of our effort, medicine cannot manifest its effect without the circulation of the blood.</p>
<p>Medicine has a germ-killing element, but food has both a germ-killing element and a supplying element. The white blood cells and the red blood cells in our blood are for killing germs and for bringing in the supply. Similarly, when the Lord&rsquo;s life operates in us, the death element of the cross in His life will have an effect on us, killing the natural man, the old creation, the self, and the flesh. At the same time, the element of resurrection in the Lord&rsquo;s life will bring in a supply. When the Lord&rsquo;s life operates in us, the element of death in His life kills all the negative things in us, and the element of resurrection supplies us with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWTH IN LIFE DEPENDING ON<br />
LIVING IN THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In order to experience the power of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, we need to live in the law of life and fellowship with the Lord continuously so that we can let the law of life, that is, the Spirit and the life of God, circulate and operate in us. When the law of life operates, it spontaneously kills and removes all the things that should not be in us, cleansing us. It also supplies us with the spiritual nutrients that we need. The circulation of the blood in our human body is the best illustration of this. We need to exercise regularly because exercise increases our circulation; when our circulation accelerates, more germs are killed, and more unclean things are removed. At the same time, the supply that we receive is richer.</p>
<p>Hence, we need to exercise more to live in the fellowship of life, pray more, meditate more, and open to the Lord more. The more spiritual exercise we have, the more the law of God&rsquo;s life will circulate and operate in us. The more it operates, the more it kills and the more it supplies. The more it kills, the more the self will go; the more it supplies, the more God will be added. What is removed from us is our self, and what is added to us is Christ. The law of life operates within us in this way day by day, and the result is that little by little our natural man decreases and God increases. Our growth in the divine life depends on this operation, Christ being formed in us depends on this operation, and our transfiguration into the Lord&rsquo;s likeness depends on this operation. The more this operation works within us, the greater the killing and the greater the supply; the more our self is removed, the more God is added.</p>
<p>Listening to messages a thousand or ten thousand times will not cause us to grow in life; only the operation of the law of life can cause us to grow. No matter how hard we study medicine or read books on health, we cannot remove sicknesses from our body. We need to take medicine so that our sicknesses can be removed and our body can be made healthy through the effect of the medicine and the circulation of the blood. Therefore, growth is not a matter of gaining knowledge by listening to messages, reading the Bible, or studying the truth; rather, it is a matter of the fellowship of life. It is worthless to have merely an outward training and pursuit without the fellowship of life inwardly. This is similar to saying that a man&rsquo;s appearance needs to match his inner being. Neither a seemingly impressive appearance nor a sloppy appearance is as important as one&rsquo;s inward content. If we do not have the fellowship of life inwardly, any outward change will be like the work of a mortician applying cosmetics to a lifeless person. Hence, the growth of life involves the fellowship of life inwardly so that we can have genuine growth and transformation outwardly.</p>
<p>We all know that outward things are rather simple to learn, but learning inward things requires one to spend much time, to pay the price, and to continuously care for the sense of the law of life. We must speak this burden unceasingly and take this as the center of our living, because there are too many children of God who have not seen this. Even those who have been trained may not necessarily see the fellowship of life. If a Christian has not seen this and has not touched the inner fellowship of life, whatever he does will be ultimately in vain. We need God to open our eyes and have mercy on us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION<br />
OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The power of the law of life within us is mainly to cause our heart to incline to God, to obey God, and to endeavor to do the works that God has prepared for us so that we can have a fresh and living service. On one hand, the result of the operation of the law of life is Christ being formed in us; on the other hand, it will make us wholly and absolutely the same as Christ outwardly. Christ being formed in us is a matter of our inward transformation; our being the same as He is outwardly is a matter of our outward transfiguration. One is the transformation of our inward nature, and the other is the transfiguration of our outward likeness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING GOD TO MAN IN THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Some may ask why God needs to be in the law of life in order to be our God. God becomes our God in the law of life because He desires that we have a living relationship with Him. He desires to be a living God within us and desires that we be His living people in Him. The relationship between Him and us, and us and Him, must be living and should not be merely in letter or regulations. This is the reason that God must be in the law of life in order to be our God.</p>
<p>Our God first came to be our life; then in this life He becomes our God. In other words, He first becomes our Father and then becomes our God. This is the reason that in the New Testament, particularly in the Epistles, the apostles addressed God mainly as &ldquo;God the Father&rdquo; or &ldquo;our God and Father.&rdquo; We first have the life of the Father; thus, we have a life relationship with Him. Later we have Him as our God. He becomes our Father so that we may have His life, and in this life He becomes our God.</p>
<p>The God in the Old Testament was God to man through regulations. Man only had to act according to these regulations in order for God to be God to man and for man to be His people. Today, however, God puts the law of His life in us and desires that we be related to Him through this law. He does not give us many regulations; He gives us only one regulation&mdash;to live in the law of life. This law of life within us will give us a sense. Our only responsibility is to live absolutely and genuinely in this sense; then spontaneously we will have and experience Him as the living God. At the same time, we can practically and livingly become those who serve God.</p>
<p>In 1947 we spoke for the first time in Shanghai concerning God being God to man in the law of life. It is true that God is our God, but if we cause the law of life to stop working in us, we will be people of God in name only, not in reality. An electric fan can be called an electric fan, but it is not an electric fan in reality if it stops turning. Likewise, if we do not let the law of life regulate and operate in us, God cannot be our God, and we cannot be His people. If we desire to be God&rsquo;s people and let God be our God in reality, not merely in name, we must live in the law of life and let the law of life regulate us within.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</h2>
<p>There are two aspects of our knowledge of God: one is inward knowledge and the other is outward knowledge. Both Hebrews 8:11 and 1 John 2:27 speak of our inward knowledge of God. Hebrews 8 speaks of the law of God&rsquo;s life, that is, God&rsquo;s life, which enables us to know God inwardly. First John 2 speaks of the anointing, that is, the revelation of the Holy Spirit, which also enables us to know God inwardly. Knowing God through the law of life is to know God through His life; knowing God through the anointing is to know God through the Spirit.</p>
<p>John 17:3 and Ephesians 1:17 also speak of our inward knowledge of God with a difference in emphasis on life and the Holy Spirit. John 17 says that life enables us to know God. Ephesians 1 says that God gives us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may know God; this means that the Holy Spirit dwells in our human spirit. Both Hebrews 8:11 and John 17:3 speak of the life in us that enables us to inwardly know God, and 1 John 2:27 and Ephesians 1:17 speak of the Holy Spirit in us that enables us to inwardly know God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Law, with Regard to Man&rsquo;s Knowledge of God, Being Unchangeable</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is fixed and unchangeable; it cannot be changed by time or human events. His nature is the same in one person as it is in another; His nature fifty years ago was the same as it is today. First John 4:8 says that God is love. Since God&rsquo;s nature is love, there is a commandment according to this nature: &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; (Lev. 19:18). This commandment of love is based upon the unchangeable nature of God. Like the unchangeable nature of God, this commandment is also unchangeable. Whether in Jerusalem or in Samaria, whether five hundred or fifty years ago, whether five hundred or fifty years from now, whether in male or female, whether in young or old, this commandment is the same; it cannot be altered because of space, time, or human events. Since the law according to God&rsquo;s nature is fixed and unchangeable, the knowledge that this law gives us is also fixed and unchangeable; it cannot be altered because of space, time, or human events.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prophets, with Regard to<br />
Man&rsquo;s Knowledge of God, Being Flexible</h2>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s nature is fixed, the law derived from God&rsquo;s nature is also fixed. Man&rsquo;s knowledge of God through the law, that is, through the law of Moses, is altogether unchangeable. However, the prophets, who represent God Himself, are living, and the commands they give can be changed. A prophet may tell someone to take a wife, but later another prophet may tell the same one not to take a wife. This is entirely different from the command or the knowledge given by the law.</p>
<p>The law is fixed, whereas prophets are flexible. Yesterday the law instructed us to love others; today it still instructs us to love others; and a hundred years from now, it will still tell us to love others. The law is fixed and unchangeable. But what about the prophets? Yesterday the prophets may have told someone to get married, but today they may tell him not to get married. The prophets are flexible. The law represents God&rsquo;s nature, and the prophets represent God Himself; God&rsquo;s nature is fixed, but God Himself is flexible and living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law Enabling Man to Know God&rsquo;s Nature,<br />
and the Prophets Enabling Man<br />
to Know God Himself</h2>
<p>Our knowledge of God through the law is rigid and fixed, but our knowledge of God through the prophets is living and unpredictable. Yesterday God might have said that we can do a certain thing, but today He may say that we cannot. Sometimes the prophets may give guidance that seems to contradict the law. The prophet Hosea received a command from God to take a wife of harlotries (Hosea 1:2). According to the law, this is not what God desires man to do, but the prophet received a command from God because He had a special purpose for him. This shows that the law is fixed but the prophets are flexible. The law enables us to know God&rsquo;s nature, and the prophets enable us to know God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the New Testament, Both the Law<br />
and the Prophets Being within Man</h2>
<p>Today the law of life within us has replaced the law of the Old Testament, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit has replaced the prophets of the Old Testament. Although we still keep the law, we are keeping an inward law, not an outward law. God&rsquo;s life is the law in us, and the Holy Spirit, as the anointing ointment, is the Prophet in us. Today we not only have the law within us, but we also have the Prophet.</p>
<p>Can we be a prophet to others? For example, if a saint wants to go to a certain place, he may come to us for fellowship, asking, &ldquo;Should I go to a certain place? Would you seek an answer from God for me?&rdquo; Concerning this matter, should he not ask himself? Should he not first seek an answer for himself? It is not right for him to ask us, because we are not his prophet, but it is also not right for him to only ask himself, because he is not a prophet only in himself. Instead, he should seek the leading of the Spirit as the anointing ointment within him; the Spirit anointing within him is the Prophet. The responsible brothers in the church are not our prophets, the co-workers are also not our prophets, and we, needless to say, are not others&rsquo; prophets.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, there are no &ldquo;individual&rdquo; prophets. The Spirit who inspired people to be prophets in the Old Testament is now the Spirit as the anointing ointment within all of us. Since the Spirit is anointing us from within, we no longer need an outward representative to be our prophet. The anointing Spirit has entered into us to be our living Prophet. In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God came upon certain people and moved only them. But now the Spirit has entered into all of us to be our Prophet. The Spirit who inspired people to be prophets has entered into us today as the anointing to be our Prophet personally and directly. Hence, we no longer need representatives to be a prophet to us outwardly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT SHOWING TYPES,<br />
AND THE NEW TESTAMENT SHOWING THE REALITY</h2>
<p>All the prophets in the Old Testament typify the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment in the New Testament. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit, the anointing ointment, has entered into us personally and directly to be our Prophet. The law in the Old Testament represents and declares the nature of God&rsquo;s life, which is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Today the nature of God&rsquo;s life has entered into us directly, so there is no longer any need for an outward law to declare it to us. In the Old Testament everything was a shadow, a type, a representation, but in the New Testament the reality has come. The sacrificial lamb in the Old Testament typified the Lord Jesus; in the New Testament the Lord Jesus has come, so there is no need for a type. Similarly, the law in the Old Testament declared the nature of God&rsquo;s life; in the New Testament the nature of God&rsquo;s life has entered into us directly so that the outward law is no longer needed. In the Old Testament the representatives through whom the Holy Spirit gave revelations were the prophets. Today the Spirit of revelation, typified by the prophets, is in us, and the Spirit gives us revelations directly. There is no need of any representative.</p>
<p>Everything in the Old Testament, in principle, is also in the New Testament, but there is a difference. For example, the Old Testament required the shedding of blood for the expiation of sins; the New Testament also requires the shedding of blood for the redemption of sins. This is a principle. However, in the Old Testament the blood that was shed for the expiation of sins was through a type, whether it was a lamb or a bull. But in the New Testament the reality of the type, Christ, has come. In the Old Testament the law, as the declaration of the nature of God&rsquo;s life, regulated man. In the New Testament the principle is the same, but we are regulated by the law of God&rsquo;s life in us. In the Old Testament the law was a representation; in the New Testament God&rsquo;s life in us is the reality of what is represented by the law.</p>
<p>The principle of God&rsquo;s giving revelation to people is the same in the New Testament as in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the prophets, as the representatives of the Holy Spirit, gave revelations to people; in the New Testament however, the Holy Spirit has entered into the believers directly to give us revelations, so there is no need of prophets. The principle in the Old Testament is the same as in the New Testament. Those who carried out the principle in the Old Testament, however, were not the reality but were merely types. In the New Testament the reality&mdash;Christ&mdash;has come, so there is no need of types such as bulls or lambs. When life comes, there is no need of the law of letter; when the Holy Spirit comes, there is no need of prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWLEDGE IMPARTED TO MAN<br />
THROUGH THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>This kind of knowledge is not a small matter. It is difficult to find a book in Christian bookstores that says that the purpose of the law is for us to know the nature of God&rsquo;s life and that the prophets are for us to know God in His infiniteness. Hardly any book speaks of the Holy Spirit in us replacing the prophets of the Old Testament. The light concerning the law of life replacing the law in the Old Testament was seen by God&rsquo;s children one hundred or even two hundred years ago, but the light concerning the Holy Spirit replacing the prophets of the Old Testament has not been seen until today. This kind of spiritual light is not that easy to see.</p>
<p>The knowledge that the law of life gives us is different from the knowledge that we receive from the anointing. Everything related to the nature of God&rsquo;s life is made known to us through the law of life; everything related to God&rsquo;s infinite self is made known to us through the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment. For example, when we purchase some fabric, the colors and patterns we choose are related to our Christian conduct, which is a reflection of God&rsquo;s nature; hence, this is a matter of the law of life. However, we may also have a sense within us as to whether we should buy one or two pieces of fabric or whether we should buy five or twenty yards of fabric. This is made known to us by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, not the law of life.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit as the anointing is absolutely related to the Holy Spirit as the law of life. For example, a brother may want to see a movie, but he does not know which movie to see. He may seek the anointing to get a sense of the Holy Spirit. Since he wants to see a movie, he prays, &ldquo;O Lord, I do not know which movie is good. Please give me a sense. Lord, the anointing teaches me concerning all things, and I have no need that anyone teach me, so please give me a leading, that I may know which movie to see.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit will never give him a sense in response to such a request because the anointing is based on the law of life. The Holy Spirit will not act as the anointing if we desire to do something that is against the law of life. The knowledge that we receive from the law of life is always strengthened by the anointing. These two interact as both cause and effect.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS THE GROWTH OF LIFE?</h1>
<p>Under normal circumstances a Christian will pursue the growth of life after being saved. Many Christians, however, have mistaken views and pursuits because they do not know what the growth of life truly is, even though they have paid a high price and are not lacking in love for the Lord. As a result, they are limited in their growth of life and are unable to follow a straight path.</p>
<p>Before pursuing the growth of life, we must first understand what the growth of life is and what are some of our mistaken concepts. The growth of life is definitely not improvement in behavior, the expression of piety, zealousness in service, an increase of knowledge, an abounding in gifts, or an increase of power; none of these are sufficient to indicate growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPROVEMENT IN BEHAVIOR<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Improvement in behavior is not the growth of life, because behavior and life belong to two different realms. Just as evil is outside the realm of life, good is also outside the realm of life. Evil and good, though different, come from the same realm, the same kingdom, because both belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Life is related to another realm, another kingdom, and it belongs to another tree&mdash;the tree of life. Therefore, good and evil are not in the same realm as life. A person by his own determination and effort can improve his behavior considerably and still be very immature in the life of God because improvement is entirely apart from life. Improvement involves work, not life. Therefore, the growth of life is not improvement in behavior.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF PIETY<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The expression of piety does not indicate the growth of life. Many religious people, such as Buddhists and Muslims, have expressions of piety toward God that are even higher than that of Christians, yet they are completely ignorant of the life of God. Their expression of piety is man-made and not the result of the work of the Holy Spirit in them through the life of Christ. Hence, expressions of piety are not the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ZEAL IN SERVICE<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Zeal in service is also not the growth of life. Although a believer&rsquo;s zeal in service shows enthusiasm toward the Lord and diligence in serving the Lord, such zeal is often mixed with human excitement and interest, originating from the soul rather than from the union of life. Of course, there are people whose zeal is of life, but not everyone&rsquo;s zeal comes from life. Many are zealously serving God, yet their life in God is very immature, and they easily stumble. Therefore, zeal in service is not necessarily the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Although the increase of knowledge is a kind of growth, it may not be the growth of life. An increase of knowledge can result in the improvement and clarity of a person&rsquo;s mind, but it can also cause him to be puffed up (1 Cor. 8:1) and be nothing before God (13:2). Only experiences of Christ can cause the life in a believer to gain more ground. Hence, the increase of knowledge is also not the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABOUNDING IN GIFTS<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Abounding in gifts is also not the growth of life. The believers in Corinth did not lack in any gift, being enriched in all utterance and all knowledge (1:5, 7). Nevertheless, Paul told them that they were infants in Christ and were fleshy (3:1). Even though a man can be enriched in gifts and knowledge, his life in the Lord may still be very young and immature, and he can still be an infant and fleshy. Thus, abounding in gifts and growing in life are completely different things. In today&rsquo;s Christianity, however, many still value gifts and neglect the growth of life.</p>
<p>Gifts are not worthy to be praised because they are outward things. In the Old Testament, Balaam&rsquo;s donkey could speak human words (Num. 22:28, 30); it was a gift. The donkey&rsquo;s ability to speak like a man was a gift. In normal circumstances, the donkey could only make sounds, but because of a special need, it was able to speak as a man. This was a gift. Although the donkey could speak as a man, it was still a donkey; it remained the same. Gifts cannot change a person.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians the apostle Paul depreciated gifts very much. He said that the believers in Corinth did not lack in any gift and were enriched in all knowledge. The Corinthians were all Greeks, and they boasted of their intellect, knowledge, and wisdom. Even though the believers in Corinth were enriched in all knowledge and gifts, Paul said that they were still fleshy.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 through 14 deals with the matter of gifts, but chapter 13 speaks of love, which is a matter of life. We may say that the love in chapter 13 is the cross and Christ. Without the cross, love has no way to flow out. The love that is manifested through the dealing of the cross is the outflow of Christ, the living out of Christ. In other words, Christ is the embodiment of love, and love is the outflow of life, the living out of Christ.</p>
<p>Gifts meant nothing to Paul&mdash;only love counted. This love, through the breaking of the cross, allows Christ to live out from us. We should never treasure gifts in the church life. It is true that we treasure the usefulness of the saints before the Lord very much; furthermore, the saints must have certain gifts in order for them to be useful. However, we must bear in mind that gifts are merely for our outward cooperation. We still need the breaking of the cross in order to allow the Holy Spirit to constitute us with more of Christ. Usefulness truly depends upon the constitution of Christ&rsquo;s life being matched with an outward gift. If we have only an outward gift but not Christ and His life within, our gift will not have much value.</p>
<p>In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul seems to depreciate gifts to the uttermost. In his second Epistle, he shows that genuine service is not a matter of gifts but of ministry. Ministry is not a matter of a donkey speaking as a man; rather, it is a matter of a person allowing the cross to break him continually and allowing the Holy Spirit to discipline him and destroy his outer man so that his inner man, that is, Christ, can be built up. This enables life to operate in him and to come out from within him so that others may receive the supply of life.</p>
<p>Gifts are depreciated in 1 Corinthians, and the ministry is shown in 2 Corinthians. This is the way of the Bible. May the Lord have mercy on us to show us that ministry surpasses gifts. Ministry is produced according to the growth of life; gifts are not the growth of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE OF POWER<br />
NOT BEING THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the increase of power is not the growth of life. In giving messages and preaching the gospel, a Christian may be quite powerful and moving, but this does not mean that he has grown in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTATIONS OF THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Increase of the Element of God</h2>
<p>The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself has been mingled with us and received by us to become our element. Therefore, the real growth of life is the increase of God&rsquo;s life within us. Life is God Himself. When life grows in us, God is increased in us. Life grows and increases to an extent that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. This is the final word of Ephesians 3:19.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Increase of the Measure<br />
of the Stature of Christ</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. Thus, growth of life is the increase of Christ within us. The more we love Christ and pursue Christ, the more the measure of the stature of Christ will increase within us. This is the real growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Expansion of the Ground of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Life is God, life is Christ, and life is also the Holy Spirit. Therefore, to grow in life is to allow the Holy Spirit to gain more ground in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Decrease of the Human Element</h2>
<p>The above three points&mdash;the increase of the element of God, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, and the expansion of the ground of the Holy Spirit&mdash;are on God&rsquo;s side. On our side, the growth of life is the decrease of our human element, that is, the decrease of the flavor of man and the increase of the flavor of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Breaking of the Natural Life</h2>
<p>The growth of life is also the breaking of the natural life. In regard to the flesh, the focus of breaking is on its corruption and its opposition to God. In regard to the self, the focus of breaking is on our thoughts and views. In regard to the natural life, the focus of breaking is on our skills, ability, and capability. Concerning these things, the more they are broken, the more the life within will grow. Thus, the growth of life, on the negative side, refers to the decrease of the human element and also to the breaking of our natural life.</p>
<p>The breaking of the natural life and the decrease of the human element are related to the growth of life. In contrast, does the improvement of behavior cause the human element to decrease? Improvement in behavior means that our behavior, which originally was not good, has improved and that we can even be more successful and considerate in dealing with people and matters. However, such improvement does not cause our human element to decrease; instead, it causes our human element to increase. It not only increases, but it is even strengthened.</p>
<p>The more a person&rsquo;s behavior improves, the more the self is strengthened. Similarly, expressions of piety cause the human element only to increase. The mere expression of piety will cause one to be strengthened rather than diminished. Hence, this is not the growth of life. Zeal in service, in the same way, causes an increase only in the human element. This is true concerning the increase of knowledge, the abounding in gifts, and the increase of power. All of these things only increase the human element and cannot cause one to have the growth of life.</p>
<p>The growth of life depends on the increase of God and Christ within us&mdash;all other aspects should decrease. If we desire to grow in life, our gifts must be stripped by God, and our shell of godliness and piety must be knocked down and broken by God. Our knowledgeable mind, our gifts, and our power must be shattered by God so that the Holy Spirit will have a way to be released. The growth of life depends upon the increase of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit within us. Everything else must decrease.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Subduing of Every Part of the Soul</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the growth of life subdues every part of our soul. The more our soul is subdued, the more life grows, and the more our soul decreases, the more life increases. This is a certain fact. When we meet a saint, there is no need to measure what has been increased in him; rather, we should observe what has been decreased in him and whether he has been poured out and broken. If there is a decrease of himself, then God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit have surely gained ground in him and have increased in him. Only this is the real growth of life.</p>
<p>The real growth of life is not the improvement of behavior, the expression of piety, zealousness in service, an increase of knowledge, an abounding in gifts, or an increase of power. Rather, the real growth of life is the increase of the element of God, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, the expansion of the ground of the Holy Spirit, the decrease of the human element, the breaking of the natural life, and the subduing of every part of the soul. On the positive side, growth in life is the increase of the Triune God within us, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, and the expanding of the ground of the Holy Spirit. On the negative side, it is the breaking, consuming, and reducing of our outer man, that is, the decrease of our human element, the breaking of our natural life, and the subduing of every part of our soul.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWING CHRIST</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT THINGS WERE GAINS, NOW BEING COUNTED<br />
AS LOSS ON ACCOUNT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:5-6 the apostle Paul speaks of his inborn strength and natural merit and also of the accomplishments that were the result of his effort. Paul says that he was &ldquo;circumcised the eighth day; of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 7 he continues, &ldquo;But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.&rdquo; <em>What things were gains to me</em> refers to that which was in the natural realm, including his inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments, including being born a Hebrew, being blameless in the law, and serving God and keeping the law. He counted all these things, which once were gains to him, as loss on account of Christ. This means that he no longer cared whether these things were gains to him and were no longer important to him. These things could not coexist with Christ. If he kept these things, relying upon his inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments, he could not know Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Moreover I also count all things to be loss.&rdquo; Verse 7 is limited to inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments by human effort, but the scope in verse 8 is broader. In this verse he counts &ldquo;all things&rdquo; as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. Paul realized that these things kept him from a knowledge of Christ. Because he desired the knowledge of Christ, he counted all things as loss, saying that he &ldquo;suffered the loss of all things&rdquo; and counted them &ldquo;as refuse&rdquo; that he could gain Christ (v. 8). Christ could not exist simultaneously with Paul&rsquo;s inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments, nor could Christ exist simultaneously with anything else. Nothing has a place in the presence of Christ. Christ is envious and jealous&mdash;He desires nothing besides Himself. God desires only Himself to be our God&mdash;He does not want anything other than Himself to be our God. Christ allows only Himself to have a place in us and does not desire any matter or thing to have a place. If we have Christ, we cannot have all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH FAITH<br />
IN CHRIST CAUSING US TO KNOW CHRIST</h2>
<p>Verse 9 continues, &ldquo;And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&rdquo; Paul did not have a righteousness that was worked out by his own effort but the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, that is, the righteousness Christ lives out of us. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To know Him.&rdquo; This righteousness caused Paul to know Christ. The righteousness that we work out by our own effort does not cause us to know Christ. The more we do by our own effort, the less we know Christ; the more we love others by our own effort, the less we know Christ; the more zealous we are by our own effort, the less we know Christ. Instead, through faith Christ can live out righteousness from within us, and this righteousness causes us to know Christ.</p>
<p>Please pay attention to the word <em>to</em> in verse 10: To know Christ. Verse 10 is not the cause but the result. Our knowledge is not without a basis; however, there is only one thing that causes us &ldquo;to&rdquo; know Christ. What causes us to know Christ? Verse 9 says clearly that relying on our own effort to keep the law, to be zealous, to do good, to serve God, and to love others will not cause us to know Christ. We need to stop our effort, stop our work, and stop all our doing good, being zealous, serving God, and loving others. We will know Christ only when we cease all our efforts and simply have faith. Our faith is in God, in Christ living in us, and in righteousness being lived out from us. This is what causes us to know Christ.</p>
<p>Having the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, which is the righteousness through faith in God, causes us to know Christ. This righteousness is the righteousness in 1 Corinthians 1:30: &ldquo;Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; God made Christ our righteousness. When we stop ourselves and believe in God and in Christ, God causes Christ to become our righteousness. In the first step, this righteousness causes us to be justified before God, that is, to be saved. In the second step, this righteousness causes us to live a righteous life, to live out righteousness, which is to live out Christ, and to live an overcoming life. Both salvation and overcoming are included. Our salvation is not through the righteousness that we work out but through Christ being our righteousness. Similarly, after being saved, our overcoming is not through the righteousness we work out but through allowing Christ to live out of us as our righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING CHRIST BY<br />
STOPPING OUR EFFORT AND ZEAL</h2>
<p>The meaning of Philippians 3:9 is that we must stop doing not only evil things but also good things. We need to stop not only our opposition to God but also our service to God. In verses 4 through 6, we can see that Paul was a man who zealously served and who was zealous in doing good. He was full of energy and exceedingly active in serving God and being a good person, but he acted in himself. At that time, he did not have any relationship with Christ. When he relied on his own effort to do good and serve God, he had no way to know Christ. In verse 9, however, he stopped his efforts to do good, stopped his zealous service, and had &ldquo;faith in Christ.&rdquo; This meant that he lived in Christ, put himself in Christ, and let Christ be his everything and no longer strived, struggled, and acted by himself. He stopped himself, he believed in Christ, he let Christ live, and he lived by Christ. His stopping enabled him to know Christ. This is a basic principle: If we desire to know Christ, we must stop ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE NOT TO WORK FOR GOD<br />
BEING UNABLE TO WORK FOR GOD</h2>
<p>The phrase <em>not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ</em> means that Paul no longer relied on himself to do good in order to have some kind of righteousness; rather, he let Christ live Himself out as righteousness. This is the same as saying, it is no longer I, but Christ (Gal. 2:20); in other words, we need to stop and let Christ live. We should not rely on our own effort to do good and to serve God zealously; instead, Christ in us, who has clothed Himself with us, is the One who should do good and serve God. In matters related to our service to God and in our daily living, we do not need to rely on ourselves; rather, we should stop ourselves and let Christ live out of us. This will enable us to know Christ.</p>
<p>When we rely on ourselves to do things, we have no way to know Christ. We can know Christ only when we stop and let Christ live. The more we do in ourselves, the less we will know Christ. We may speak about Christ every day, but Christ may only be a doctrine to us and not our living. Many who work for the Lord, serve in the church, and manage the affairs of the church seem to be doing many things for the Lord, yet I must ask, how much do we know Christ? If we do not have much knowledge of Christ, our service is merely an activity in which we rely on ourselves. We must see the light that we need to stop ourselves. Our stopping must extend beyond the matter of no longer opposing God to the matter of serving God.</p>
<p>Many saints have the virtue of humility but do not know Christ at all, and they love God and others but do not know Christ. They continue to preach the gospel zealously, but the more they are zealous, the less they know Christ. When they love others, their love does not cause them to experience Christ, because their love comes out of themselves. When they preach the gospel and serve God, their preaching and serving do not cause them to experience Christ, because their preaching comes out from themselves. Without the experience of Christ, there is no knowledge of Christ. If we have a little meekness and a little humility, it should be the result of our experience of Christ. In other words, it should come from Christ being expressed through us. When we are meek, Christ must be expressed through us; when we are humble, Christ must be expressed through us; when we give a message, Christ must be expressed through us; and when we go out to preach the gospel, Christ must be expressed through us. If this is our situation, we will have a deeper knowledge of Christ. In loving others, preaching the gospel, and serving God, we must stop. We do not need to work out these things; instead, Christ should live out of us.</p>
<p>Those who are unable to stop, that is, not to work for God, are unable to work for God. Those who do not have the capacity not to work for God are also unable to work for God. If we desire to work for God, stopping our work for Him is a prerequisite. Only when we are able not to love others will we genuinely be able to love others; those who are unable not to love others are also unable to love others. Those who always desire to work and who are unable to stop cannot work for God. Only those who are able not to love others for God are able to love others for God. Only those who are able not to speak and give messages for God are able to speak and give messages for God. If we cannot stop speaking, Christ can never speak. If we are unwilling to come to an end, God can never have a beginning. If we do not stop ourselves, we can never know Christ.</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, after the War of Resistance had been won, we were in Shanghai, and a zealous man who was quite famous came among the saints. He was very humble, expressing a willingness to receive help and leading from us. As a person who served the Lord and who expressed a willingness to fellowship with us and receive help from us, we felt that his words were honest and humble, so we had fellowship with him. We testified to him how the Lord had opened our eyes to see that much of our zealousness and activities had come out of ourselves, not the Lord. We told him that even though it was done for the Lord, it was not the Lord working out from us. Then we told him of how God opened our eyes to see that we were the most pitiful people. We had done much, yet we still did not have much Christ, and we had run much, yet we only knew Christ a little. But when we saw our pitiful situation, we stopped. Strictly speaking, it was not we who stopped; rather, God&rsquo;s light shined upon us to such an extent that we could not move, we had no strength, and we stopped.</p>
<p>We earnestly testified how God showed us that Christ lived in us and that we should let Christ live. This brother nodded his head, but before we could finish speaking, he asked, &ldquo;How do you feel about my going to Putong to preach the gospel?&rdquo; We said, &ldquo;Brother, we have just testified that any activity that comes from ourselves does not enable us to experience Christ, nor does it have much place before God.&rdquo; He still did not understand, and he asked further, &ldquo;But a group of Christians is there; how should I lead them?&rdquo; After a lengthy fellowship, we realized that he had no intention of fellowshipping with us concerning the inner knowledge of life; instead, he had come to study with us, hoping to get some strategies for expanding his work.</p>
<p>He asked us what we had done to gain so many people, because even the alley was full of people during our meetings. He had heard that we were having a revival and that the number of people was very large, and he therefore came to consult with us. He was like Nicodemus, who came to the Lord Jesus to consult about how to be a proper man. However, the Lord Jesus spoke to him straightforwardly, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you,...you must be born anew&rdquo; (John 3:2-5, 7). This brother did not come for life, nor did he come for the way to be a proper man&mdash;he came to know how to work. We spoke earnestly for more than an hour of our need to stop ourselves in the work and to let Christ live out from us, but not a single word penetrated. In him there were many &ldquo;buts.&rdquo; Whenever he spoke, he would ask, &ldquo;But what do you think we should do for the gospel?&rdquo; &ldquo;But there is still a group of believers in Southeast Asia; how should we lead them?&rdquo; No matter what we said, nothing entered into him because the only thing that occupied him was how to work; he could not stop himself.</p>
<p>Those who are unable not to work for God are unable to work for God; those who are unable to stop for God are unable to move for God. If we truly desire to know Christ, we must stop ourselves&mdash;stop our humility, stop our love, stop our zeal, and stop our so-called work for the Lord. We say this before the Lord: If we rely on our own effort to be good Christians and to serve God properly, we can never experience Christ or know Christ. The prerequisite for knowing the Christ who lives in us is that we must stop ourselves: stop our meekness, goodness, humility, love, zeal, diligence, service, work, and bearing of responsibility. Christ can have a beginning in us only when we stop ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />
BY LETTING CHRIST BE THE INITIATOR IN US</h2>
<p>Philippians 3 shows that we can know Christ when we stop ourselves in matters related to the service of God. We must stop ourselves in the good things. We must stop ourselves not only in committing sins, being cold toward God, and opposing God, but even more we need to stop ourselves in our zeal and service to God. God will never initiate anything in someone who has not stopped himself; everything he does, whether serving God or loving others, is initiated by himself and done by himself from the beginning to the end. Only those who stop themselves and let God initiate and work can know Christ.</p>
<p>If we have not stopped, Christ cannot initiate anything in us. We can preach Christ, but we cannot know Christ or experience Christ. We can speak of Christ constantly, but we will not know Christ at all. Christ will be in our mouth but not in our experience, and He will be spoken of in the messages we give but will not be in our living. We may have preached Christ for many years, but has Christ initiated any of our preaching? Is it &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is speaking about Christ, &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is preaching Christ, and &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is working for God? If this is so, then Christ is not working for God in us, Christ is not speaking of Himself through us, nor is Christ preaching Himself through us. Both kinds of preaching may be on the same subject, but the source and process are different. Paul preached Christ, but the source of his preaching was Christ. Not only were his word and subject Christ, but the source and process of his speaking were also Christ. In contrast, our word and subject may be Christ, but the source and process of our preaching are merely ourselves. We may go to a distant place to work for Christ, yet Christ is not in that work. We may work and be zealous, but if we never stop ourselves, Christ will not be present during the whole process.</p>
<p>Before being shined upon by the Lord&rsquo;s great light on the way to Damascus, Saul was a zealous man. He was zealous for the God of his fathers and blameless in the law, but he had never stopped and he did not know Christ (Acts 9:1-5). In Philippians, however, he could say that he counted as loss, as refuse, the things that were gains to him on account of Christ. He stopped himself, his zeal and effort ceased, and Christ could begin in him. Once a person stops, Christ can act, move, and reveal all His riches in him, allowing him to know Christ practically in experience.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING CONFORMED TO<br />
THE MOLD OF THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH</h1>
<p>The center of Philippians 3 is the matter of being conformed to the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; What is the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death? A man can be strong, sound, sober-minded, intelligent, rich in emotion, and strong in will. Such a man has a large soul, a thriving soul. In a sense, he has no weakness but is perfectly sound, fully developed, and has a strong personality. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was such a man. He was intelligent and sober-minded, rich in emotion, being able to weep as well as smile, and strong in His will. While He was on the earth, however, He was always putting Himself to death, that is, putting His intelligent mind, rich emotion, and strong will to death so that God could be His mind, emotion, and will. This is the mold of the death of Christ, that is, the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>We should never think that the death of Christ refers only to His death on the cross. The death of Christ refers not only to His death on the cross but also to His putting Himself to death as a man in order to do the will of God. The basic principle of death is that of completely putting ourselves to death so that the will of God can be carried out. This is the death of the cross. Our knowledge of the death of the cross is too low and too shallow, and we may consider Christ&rsquo;s death of the cross only in relation to the redemption of man. However, redemption is only a small part of the meaning of the cross. The cross has a deeper and higher meaning related to Christ&rsquo;s willingness to put Himself to death so that God could have a way.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not die only on the cross&mdash;He was dying every day while He was on the earth. The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. From the beginning, He put Himself to death. During these thirty-three and a half years, He was living in death. Even though He was such a sound person on earth, He was always putting Himself to death, always denying His mind, emotion, and will. He denied everything of Himself so that God could come out of Him and have a free way to supply the needs of many. This is the death of Christ.</p>
<p>The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to a sound man who has the capacity to live and think independently, love matters and things, express opinions, and make decisions by himself, but who still does not rely on himself. Christ denied and rejected everything of Himself, whether it was His mind, emotion, or will so that God could come out of Him and supply others. He denied Himself even though He was rich and strong in every part of His being. This is the death of Christ. The death of Christ involves nothing less than putting such a sound humanity to death so that God can have a way to come out.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF PHILIPPIANS 3&mdash;<br />
BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>The entire life of the Lord Jesus, as portrayed in the four Gospels, is based on this principle. In the Gospels we see a person who was sober-minded, rich in emotion, and strong in will, a person who was perfectly sound yet refused to rely on Himself and continually put Himself aside. He did not rely on His own mind, preferences, or views; instead, He lived by God. He continually denied His intelligent mind, rich emotion, and strong will; He continually denied Himself so that God could work in Him freely and could have a way to come out of Him to supply others. This is the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to the continual putting of oneself to death so that God can have a way to come out. This is the center of Philippians 3.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3 Paul&rsquo;s mind was excellent, his emotion was rich, and his will was strong. He was a man of fervor and accomplishments. He had a resourceful mind, a rich emotion, and a strong will. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, people could tell that he had an excellent mind, a rich emotion, and a strong will and that he was an accomplished, resolute, and courageous man simply by observing his actions, words, and attitude. In Philippians 3, however, he was learning the lesson of putting himself into the death of Christ to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. To be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is to deny the self and give God a free way. Paul was such a person. He continually denied himself to give God a way. This is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, and this is the central point of Philippians 3.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3 Paul says that he was a Hebrew of Hebrews, that as to law he was a Pharisee, that as to zeal he persecuted the church, and that as to the righteousness in the law he was successful to the point of being blameless. However, all these things were only of himself; whether they were related to his mind, emotion, or will, it was all out of himself. At that time, he lived entirely in himself without anything of the death of Christ; he did not have the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death in his living.</p>
<p>After he became an apostle and especially during his imprisonment, he continually learned the lesson of denying himself and letting the Lord&rsquo;s death do a work of conformation in him. He continually allowed the Lord&rsquo;s death to put the seal of death on his mind, emotion, and will. His natural man, natural life, natural thinking, natural strength, natural will, and natural preferences all bore the seal of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, and in him there was the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death. In him people could see a situation, a condition, in which a sound man was denying himself. He was a man standing in death, rejecting his self. He was a man who denied himself and who put himself in death so that God could have a way out from him. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death was in Paul.</p>
<p>We cannot have such a mold simply by hearing, believing, and accepting a message. This mold is the result of conformity, of being conformed, which takes ten to twenty years, or at least five to eight years. It comes from continually learning the lesson and taking the way of always denying the self and not relying on the self in serving God or in doing the Lord&rsquo;s work. Not only do we not rely on our intelligence, talent, wisdom, and ability, but we also do not rely on our preferences, emotions, and even less, on our opinions and our will. Rather, we continually put these things of the soul to death so that Christ, the Holy Spirit, and God will have the ground in us and a way to come out of us. This kind of condition indicates that the mold of death has been imprinted on us; such a death is the death of Christ.</p>
<p>When we have the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death imprinted on us, as soon as people come into contact with us, they can sense that we are intelligent, rich in emotion, and strong in our will. However, they can also sense that there is a deep, clear, and distinct seal of death in our intelligence, emotion, and will. Although we have an intelligent mind, a rich emotion, and a strong will, we refuse to use them and even dare not to use them. In our mind, emotion, and will there is a very deep mold, which is the seal that has been imprinted on us by the death of Christ. This shows our conformation to the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death in Philippians 3.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Philippians 3 the apostle Paul speaks of people who boasted in their strong qualities and their capabilities in serving God and in working for the Lord (vv. 2-4). In response, Paul says, truthfully speaking, that if they could boast in such a way, he could boast all the more and was in no way inferior to them in any of these things. Even if they could boast in their cleverness, Paul was more clever. Even if they could boast in their emotions and capabilities, Paul was more capable. Even if they could boast in their resolve and zeal, Paul was more resolute and zealous.</p>
<p>However, Paul says that he counted as loss the things that were gains to him on account of Christ. Paul was standing in death, putting to death all the things that were gains to him; he no longer allowed himself to live in these things. Paul put himself to death and let Christ live in him and live out of him. By putting himself to death and being in death, Paul allowed Christ to live out of him. If he lived out himself, Christ would have no way. Once Paul put himself to death, however, resurrection came out, and Christ had a way. This mold of death was imprinted onto Paul&rsquo;s being. In his living, person, and work, there was a seal&mdash;the death of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">TO LIVE IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
BEING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Learning to live in the fellowship of life does not mean that we need to continuously pray behind closed doors. Many people think that this kind of prayer before the Lord is to live in the fellowship of life. This is not wrong, but strictly speaking, a person learning to live in the fellowship of life must see that fellowship is of life and that this life is the Holy Spirit in our spirit. In order to live in the fellowship of life, we must learn to live in the spirit. This is the basic lesson. In order to learn to live in the spirit, we must learn to deny the self and to thoroughly and seriously reject whatever is of our mind, emotion, and will. Only in this way can we live in the spirit. Only when we truly live in the spirit can we sense the fellowship of life that is in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING THE MIND TO DEATH</h2>
<p>If we have not learned the lesson of being conformed to the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death, we are still living according to ourselves, that is, we love by ourselves, express opinions by ourselves, and make decisions by ourselves. We do not have the experience of death if we have not allowed the death of Christ to be imprinted on our mind, nor allowed the death of Christ to kill our mind. As such, we will live according to our thinking, and we will let our thoughts be loose instead of holding them back. Therefore, when we desire to turn from our mind to our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord, it will be impossible because our mind will not listen to us. When we desire to adjust our mind, it will not respond because we have indulgently and loosely lived in our mind much of the time.</p>
<p>In our living, we must continually learn the lesson of allowing the Holy Spirit to apply the death of Christ in our mind. In our daily living and contact with people and matters, we need to let the death of Christ do a killing work in our mind. We must learn to deny our mind in everything. If our mind bears the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death, we will easily be able to live in the spirit, and without much effort, we will be able to turn back to the inner man.</p>
<p>If we desire to learn the inward fellowship of life, we must allow the Holy Spirit to continually kill everything in our mind, emotion, and will, continually putting every part of our soul to death. This is the reason the Holy Spirit often raises up a specific environment to deal with us; this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit conquers our mind, overcomes our emotion, and subdues our will through the things we encounter. Furthermore, in coordination with His work through the outward environment, the Holy Spirit also works within us to put us in the place of death. He does this time after time and little by little until we are put to death completely.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REAL GROWTH DEPENDING ON<br />
THE BREAKING OF THE SELF</h2>
<p>Real growth before the Lord involves the breaking of our self, and it involves being put to death little by little. We often think that a person&rsquo;s growth depends on his ability to give a better message, to study the Bible more thoroughly, and to handle matters more skillfully. Such things, however, are not indications of real growth. However, when the saints can testify that a brother, who lived by his natural mind, emotion, and will, has been deeply touched by the Lord in his mind, has been dealt with by the Lord in his emotion, and has been broken by the Lord in his will, we should worship God and acknowledge that this person has grown. If this is the case, then the marks of death, the mold of death, and the seal of death surely have been increased in this brother&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will. A person can discern the spirit from the soul only when his self has been dealt with sufficiently by God. When the natural man has been dealt with severely enough by God, he will not rely on his soul but rather learn to live by the spirit.</p>
<p>Peace Wang was a sister who learned many spiritual lessons. She always handled matters calmly, being neither quickly nor slowly. On one occasion, she was going to northern China. As she was about to board the boat, people were rushing to get off the boat while others were rushing to get on the boat. The sisters who were seeing her off were quite anxious, but she remained calm and was not hurried at all. The sisters were very impressed by this and felt that they should imitate her by being calm and composed. However, this kind of imitation is useless. A person who has not dealt with his emotion is always in turmoil. If a person constantly allows God to deal with his emotion, his emotion will be broken. It can be compared to an amplifier that cannot give out sound or a torn eardrum that cannot hear. Only those whose emotions have been smitten, broken, and touched by God and have been dealt with by the cross can remain calm and be neither fast nor slow regardless of the circumstances. Such calmness cannot be imitated.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERY PART OF THE SOUL<br />
NEEDING TO BE BROKEN BY GOD</h2>
<p>When everything around us is peaceful, we may be like Mary, who sat calmly at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and listened to His words. But as soon as we hear that our children are sick, we panic and cannot be quiet even for two minutes to ask the Lord where we should take our children. If a man who is full of emotion has been broken in God&rsquo;s hands, he can remain calm and unhurried even when he hears that his child is sick. This does not mean that he is calm because of his own efforts but that his faculty of panicking, in other words, his emotion, has been broken. This can be compared to an electric bulb that cannot shine even when the electricity is switched on, because it has a broken filament. When our emotional &ldquo;filament&rdquo; has been broken by God, we will surely remain unhurried inwardly no matter what news we hear. If we hear about a matter that concerns us and are able to react to it as if we were bystanders, this is a proof that the emotional &ldquo;filament&rdquo; within us has been broken. This is not something we can imitate outwardly; we will respond in this way only when the unsteady &ldquo;filament&rdquo; in us has been broken. Every part of our soul needs to be gradually broken and shattered by God.</p>
<p>There was a brother who complained that he had no way to pray because of the noise related to living with four other brothers. When we asked him how he could pray, he said that it was best when he was alone in a quiet room. When we are alone in our room, our mind often wanders. We all have this experience. When we were really alone in our room, our mind often wanders to New York, Washington, London, Shanghai, and Tokyo. In less than half an hour we can travel around the whole world. Hence, we should not complain about the environment or blame others for disturbing us. All of the real distractions are within us. If the &ldquo;filament&rdquo; of these distractions was broken, we would be able to pray even if there were people quarreling around us.</p>
<p>Some have truly learned the lesson in these matters. There was a brother who was led by the Lord to cast out many demons. While the experience of casting out demons is not very deep, the lesson that this brother learned before the Lord was deep. On one occasion, a woman was possessed by a demon, and her husband asked the brother to come and cast the demon out. He came with another brother, and they knelt down together to pray. While they were praying, the woman possessed by the demon took a pair of scissors and started to make a noise with the handles. However, the brother continued to pray. The demon-possessed woman then walked toward the brother, holding the scissors in her hand. This brother, however, was not disturbed and continued to pray without being affected. The demon-possessed woman, however, continued to make noise with the scissors as she walked back and forth beside the brother. The situation was truly frightening.</p>
<p>At a certain point the brother had a sense from the Holy Spirit within him. He immediately stopped praying and said, &ldquo;Lord, in Your name I command this demon to stop and be still.&rdquo; The woman stopped and put down the scissors. The brother then stood up with the other brother and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus the Nazarene, I command you to leave her body.&rdquo; Then the demon came out. The noise and disturbance at the scene were truly extreme, but this brother was able to continue to pray and be restful before the Lord. This shows that his emotion, which otherwise would have been affected, and his mind, which otherwise would have been susceptible to fluctuations, had been dealt with to a considerable extent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE DEATH OF THE CROSS<br />
IN EVERYTHING IN OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>If we desire to learn the lesson of the cross properly, we must learn to continually put our mind, emotion, and will to death in every matter in our daily living. If we are easily moved in our emotion to like someone or can easily be stumbled by others and have a negative feeling toward them, we will find it very difficult to turn back to our spirit when we try to pray. We must all learn the lesson of not letting the death of the cross become a doctrine but rather of letting it be executed in every part of our being. We must be clear that if we freely do things according to our mind, emotion, and will, it will be impossible to turn our being when it is time to pray. We can turn back to our inner man only when we allow the Holy Spirit the opportunity to continually deal with us through the cross in our everyday situations.</p>
<p>Our being needs to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death until our mind, emotion, and will have the seal of death. This means that even though our mind, emotion, and will still exist, they have been broken. When situations arise, we can be unmoved in our mind, emotion, and will, and none of these inner parts will function in themselves because they have been broken by God. At such a time, we will be able to turn to our inner man because the outer man has been broken. This is not a doctrine but a very serious lesson.</p>
<p>As we are learning the lesson of being in the death of the cross, our outer man is decaying and being broken day by day, and our inner man is be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). Our soul is being broken, but our spirit is being built up: this is the way of fellowshipping with the Lord. Every day we need to designate a certain time to pray to the Lord and have personal fellowship with Him. Even when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He often went up to the mountain alone to pray (Matt. 14:23; Luke 6:12). However, the basic point is that our mind, emotion, and will must be dealt with by the cross in normal situations so that when we fellowship with the Lord in prayer, we will not be distracted by the things of our outer man.</p>
<p>Many people encounter problems when they pray, that is, their mind wanders and daydreams a great deal. There is nothing that can help us with this apart from allowing the cross to deal with our mind in our daily situations. If our mind has been dealt with, it will spontaneously focus and listen to us when we pray. Dealing with any problem hinges on Christ and His crucifixion. This is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of the cross in the Holy Spirit becoming a reality in our daily experience to deal with our natural man. This is the only way for Christ to have the ground in us and for us to touch spiritual reality. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we will learn the lesson of the cross and be kept in the way of fellowship with the Lord and of prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>

THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION<br />
AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SUFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Philippians 3:9 says, &ldquo;And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&rdquo; Then verse 10 gives the result: &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection.&rdquo; Verse 10 continues, &ldquo;And the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; This means that we not only suffer with Him, but we also fellowship with Him in His sufferings. The word <em>know</em> in verse 10 involves three items: knowing Christ, knowing the power of His resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings. The verb <em>know</em> has three objects: Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</p>
<p>Participation in the fellowship of His sufferings results in being conformed to His death. &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ATTAINING TO THE OUT-RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; The American Standard Version renders this verse as: &ldquo;If by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; The result of being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is attaining unto the resurrection from the dead. This matter is difficult to understand. According to 1 Thessalonians 4, all the saved ones, those who belong to the Lord, who are dead in Christ will be resurrected at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. There is no doubt in regard to this. However, even a person like Paul, who not only was saved but who also overcame, did not dare to say he would definitely attain to the resurrection from the dead; rather, he says, &ldquo;If...I may.&rdquo; It seems as if there is a contradiction and inconsistency between the word spoken in Philippians 3 and the word in 1 Thessalonians 4.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 4:16 says that all those who believe in the Lord and who are saved will be resurrected at the Lord&rsquo;s return. The apostle used these words to comfort Christians whose family members had passed away. If we have family members who have passed away, we should not grieve like unbelievers. When an unbeliever dies, there is no hope, but when a believer dies, we have hope because we will be resurrected when the Lord returns. This word is very clear, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>If this is the case, why did Paul say, &ldquo;If perhaps I may,&rdquo; when speaking about himself in Philippians 3? It seems as if he was not sure. According to Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, <em>resurrection</em> here refers to an extraordinary resurrection, not an ordinary one. The Greek word indicates an extra-resurrection. I spent much time to study this verse, and finally I saw that even though all the saints will be resurrected in the future, there is an extra-resurrection, an outstanding resurrection in that resurrection. For example, all of the students in a class will graduate, but among these students there may be three students who are outstanding. We may say that the top three students have an &ldquo;extra-graduation.&rdquo; All the students who passed their exams will graduate, but only the top three will be recognized as outstanding with awards, prizes, and honors.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:12 says, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In 1 Thessalonians 4 the apostle says that there is a resurrection for every saved person, but in Philippians 3 he says that he might not obtain the out-resurrection. He continued, &ldquo;Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). These verses clearly show that the &ldquo;out-resurrection&rdquo; which Paul spoke of refers to a prize.</p>
<p>We need to emphasize that in order for someone to be conformed to the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death, he must know Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. No one can be conformed to the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death without having sufficient knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The meaning of <em>being conformed to His death</em> is that one has put to death all that he is, including his mind, emotion, will, preference, and opinion, thus allowing God to have a way in him. This is the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death. Being conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death means that in our daily living, we pass through death. Those who are conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death are those who know resurrection, and those who know resurrection are those who know Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 10 three things are linked together: knowing Christ, knowing resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings, which is being conformed to His death. The first thing for us to know is Christ, then resurrection, and finally the fellowship of His sufferings. Knowing the fellowship of His sufferings is to be conformed to His death. The more we participate in and have fellowship with Him in His sufferings, the more we are conformed to His death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST DESIRING TO BE LIVED OUT<br />
FROM THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Because the book of Philippians does not speak much on knowing Christ, we need the book of Colossians. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; All that belongs to God is in Christ: love is in Christ, holiness is in Christ, light is in Christ, and power is also in Christ. Love, holiness, light, and power are elements of the divine nature. Hence, God is love, God is holiness, God is light, and God is power. All these are elements of God&rsquo;s nature, and all these are in Christ.</p>
<p>If we desire to enjoy all the fullness of the Godhead, we need to know Christ. In order to know Christ, we need to know that all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ: love is in Christ, holiness is in Christ, light is in Christ, and power is in Christ. All the elements of the Godhead are in Christ for us to enjoy. In order for Christ to give us all the fullness of the Godhead which dwells in Him as our enjoyment, He must be our life. Christ being our life is a matter of resurrection, and His coming to be our life means that He desires to be lived out from us.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM IN HIS SUFFERINGS</h2>
<p>We all know that the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and that He is in us. Christ died and resurrected, but is He dead or alive in us? The parable of sowing in Matthew 13 compares our heart to the field and the life of the Lord to the seed. I would like to ask, after the seed is sown into the earth, is it dead or resurrected? Being sown into the ground is to die, and growing out of the ground is to be resurrected. When a seed is sown, it is in death; when it grows, it is in resurrection.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Christ is sown into us, He is sown in death and He comes out in resurrection. The Lord enters into people like us in order to die. However, His death is for His living and growth. This growth is the story of the Lord&rsquo;s life and the experience of the Lord&rsquo;s life in resurrection. On the one hand, the Lord&rsquo;s coming into us can be compared to a seed falling and being buried in the ground, surrounded by the soil; on the other hand, there is life in the seed, and this life is the resurrection life with the resurrection power. The life that is confined in the soil has an ability to emerge from the soil, to grow out of the soil. I believe that many of us have seen seeds sprouting and growing out of the soil. The soil is broken apart by the sprouts coming out through the power of life within the seed; the soil splits, and the sprout grows.</p>
<p>If the soil could speak, it would say, &ldquo;The seed in me has life; it has the power of resurrection, and it continually presses me apart so that it can grow and release its life.&rdquo; There is a constant function within the seed, which is the power of resurrection; as a result, when the seed grows, its power splits the soil apart. This is the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s death, being conformed to the mold of His death.</p>
<p>Christ passed through death and resurrection and lives in us. There is a power of life within Him, which is the power of resurrection. Once He enters into us, the power of resurrection constantly pushes us and demands that we give Him a way to grow. The way to grow is through the fellowship of His sufferings. His sufferings are His putting of Himself to death. John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; His falling into the ground and dying is His suffering. Having fellowship with Him in His sufferings means that we also fall into the ground and die.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION LIFE DEMANDING US TO DIE<br />
AND PUSHING US TO DIE</h2>
<p>The resurrection power within us demands that we put ourselves to death; it also pushes us and puts us to death. The resurrection life in us can be compared to a seed in the soil that desires to grow. In order for a seed to grow, there is a need for the breaking open of the soil, and in order for Christ to grow, there is a need for us to be broken open. However, the soil cannot break itself open; rather, it is the power of the resurrection life in the sprout that pushes on the soil and breaks it open. We also are not able to break ourselves; instead, the resurrection life of Christ will break us.</p>
<p>This is not an illustration but a fact that describes how the life of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power is always demanding that we put ourselves to death, demanding that we put to death our mind, emotion, will, view, capability, ability, and self. Even with such a demand on us, we cannot meet the demand. Thank the Lord, however, that He is also the power of resurrection in us that pushes us and puts us to death. On one hand, the resurrection life in us demands that we die, and on the other, it also pushes us to die.</p>
<p>We can be working for the Lord like Saul of Tarsus, using our eloquence, talent, zealousness, and capabilities. If we use our talents and abilities, we will realize, especially when we are quiet before the Lord, that there is an inward demand that we put these talents and abilities aside and not rely on them. This is the resurrection life in us demanding that we put to death our ability and eloquence; this is the resurrection life demanding that we die.</p>
<p>The resurrection life is the power of resurrection. This power, or we can say this life, inwardly demands that we put ourselves and everything in our soul to death. Sometimes, we have no strength to answer Christ&rsquo;s demand. Yet His resurrection life not only demands, it also pushes. In Christ there is a power that can push us into death. This is similar to a seed growing out of the ground by being pushed out by the power of life.</p>
<p>We have all had this kind of experience. The resurrection life of Christ within us demands that we die, and the power of resurrection within us pushes us into death. Once it pushes us, we have fellowship with Christ in His sufferings; that is, we suffer with Him, and at the same time, we are conformed to His death. As a result, others see that we are constantly denying our self and constantly putting our mind, emotion, and will to death; hence, God has a way to come out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUT-RESURRECTION BEING A PRIZE</h2>
<p>When we have this kind of experience, the living that we have will be an overcoming living, which is also a living for God in Christ to be enjoyed by us. This will cause us to be filled with all the fullness of the Godhead and enable us to mature in the life of God early and be the firstfruits in Revelation 14:4. The firstfruits will be reaped before the harvest. This is the out-resurrection. There is an out-resurrection because the firstfruits ripen early and fully. They can ripen early and fully because they put themselves to death day by day and allow God to pass through them, allow the riches of God to be their enjoyment, and allow the element of God to be added into them day by day.</p>
<p>This out-resurrection is a prize for the group of people who are conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. This is what the apostle Paul pursued. This is different from the reward commonly spoken of by Christians, which is too shallow. The prize that some will receive in the future is related to their early maturity in life. Early maturity in life is based on our experience of the resurrection life which enables the element of God to be added into us again and again. We can experience this through our fellowship with Him in His sufferings and by being conformed to His death. Paul pursued this in order to lay hold of that for which he also had been laid hold of by Christ Jesus (Phil. 3:12).</p>
<p>If Paul did not pursue that for which he had been laid hold of by the Lord, he would not have been able to lay hold of it. For him to pursue meant that he pursued to pass through death so that all that is in God could become his enjoyment. He pursued so he could lay hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by the Lord. This pursuit required him to be a person who ripened early, who became a firstfruit, and who attained to the out-resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO &ldquo;THIS RULE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind,&rdquo; and in verse 16, he continues, &ldquo;nevertheless whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.&rdquo; This means that we should walk by and according to the same principle whereunto we attained. This is to put ourselves to death and to be conformed to the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death so that His life can have a way to come out of us. We need to walk by this rule in whatever state we have attained in our spiritual life today.</p>
<p>Verse 15 says that whoever is full-grown among us must have this mind, that is, must pursue this matter. Then verse 16 says we should all walk according to this rule in whatever state we have attained, whether we are newly saved, childish, experienced, or advanced. This means that we must walk by this rule whether we are sanctified or not, whether we are experienced or not, whether we are childish or weak. The rule is to be conformed to the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death and to allow His power of resurrection to open a way for God to pass through us. We should all take this as a rule, walk according to this rule, and have the intention to keep this rule.</p>
<p>Putting ourselves to death and being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is a basic requirement of God on us because He desires to have a way to come out of us. Once this way is opened and everything of God has become our enjoyment, we will be able to progress rapidly in His life and mature early. Then in that day we will attain to the out-resurrection as our prize. We should all pursue the out-resurrection, that is, pursue that for which we have been laid hold of by the Lord. We should take this as a rule and walk according to this rule.</p></body></html>
