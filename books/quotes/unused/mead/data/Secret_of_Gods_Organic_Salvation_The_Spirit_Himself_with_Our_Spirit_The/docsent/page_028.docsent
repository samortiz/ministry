   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Believers Brought into the Glory of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the time of the rapture of the believers who are matured in the divine life, they will be brought in their spirit exulting with Christ from without into the glory of God for their glorification Rom 8:30; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Matured Believers Being Glorified</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The matured believers will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through their being brought into God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At present the inking is saturating us with God s glory from within.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, we will be brought into God s glory in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whereas the inner saturating is a lifelong process, our being brought into God s glory outwardly will be instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, we will be brought into God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the matured believers will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through their being brought into God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>E. The Top Portion of the Divine Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glorification of the matured believers is the top portion of their divine sonship in God s organic salvation, which sonship they received at the time of their regeneration Gal 4:5; Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God s organic salvation the matter of sonship is very critical and central.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The redemption of our body is the highest enjoyment of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 8:23 says, We ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As an elderly person with a number of physical infirmities, I often groan because of the weakness of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, while I am groaning I am awaiting sonship, the redemption of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The day is coming when our body will be redeemed and we will enter into the full enjoyment of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>F. The Redemption and Transfiguration of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The redemption of the believers body is the transfiguration of their body at the Lord s coming back Phil 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>G. The Redemption of the Body Being Judicial</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and the Transfiguration of the Body Being Organic</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word redemption indicates that the redemption of the body is judicial because the believers redeemed body is of the fallen old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This redemption of the believers body is the finalization of God s judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word transfiguration indicates that the redemption of the believers body is organic because the transfiguration of their body is by the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>H. Participating in God s Divinity to the Uttermost</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine glorification of the glorified believers makes the consummated believers participate in God s divinity to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these messages we have considered the eight sections of God s organic salvation: regeneration, feeding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s goal in these eight sections of His organic salvation is simply to make us God, that is, to make us a duplication, a xerox copy, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through regeneration God imparted His life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we have the divine life, and we are also partaking of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, we have God s mind and the element of Christ s unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have the riches of Christ means that we have God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we have God s life, God s nature, God s mind, and God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, we will be conformed to the image of Christ, the first God-man, and we will be fully saturated with the glory of the divine life and be brought into God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time we will have God s life, God s nature, God s mind, God s being, and God s glory and we will bear God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will surely have become God in life, in nature, and in expression but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If such a person is not God, what is he?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When our body is redeemed and transfigured and we thereby enjoy the highest portion of the divine sonship, we will be able to say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have been made God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord that I have God s life, God s nature, God s mind, God s being, and God s glory and that I am in God s image!</S>
