   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION SECT Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this supplementary word my third burden is to show you the factors of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A denomination is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divisions that have been produced among us in recent years have not yet denominated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, they are not yet denominations, but they are surely sects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. A Special Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first factor of a denomination or a sect is a special teaching that differs from "the teaching of the apostles" Acts 2:42 in the entire New Testament, such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery to administrate the church by the eldership , head covering, the keeping of days, diet, or a particular stress on a certain point of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of these matters may be scriptural, but we should not make any of these a special teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is right for us to have all our practices according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, in our practice we baptize people by immersion and we have the eldership, but we do not make these things particular items that divide us from other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Certain Christians divide themselves from other Christians over the matter of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer desires to be received into their membership, they require him to be baptized by immersion in their baptistry, by their pastor, and in their water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he is baptized by immersion in another place and by other people, they will not recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a special, particular teaching that divides these believers from other Christians, making them a sect and a denomination.</S>
