<h1 class="title">TEN &ldquo;WORMS&rdquo; THAT DESTROY THE ONENESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 133</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS<br />
TO DWELL TOGETHER IN ONENESS</h2>
<p>Psalm 133 is a clear description of a local church that is under God&rsquo;s blessing. In such a local church the fine oil is flowing, and the dew of Hermon is descending (vv. 2-3). God&rsquo;s blessing to the church is simply life, which is also God Himself. This psalm is symmetrical in content; it has two items, two conditions, and two issues. The two items are the fine oil and the dew of Hermon, the two conditions are goodness and pleasantness, and the two issues are a flowing and a descending. In this psalm we can see the condition of a local church that is under God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The blessing upon a local church depends on the believers&rsquo; dwelling in unity (v. 1). Unity in this verse is a picture of the genuine oneness in the church. Oneness is higher than unity. When there is oneness, there is no need for uniting. The blessing on the church depends on our dwelling in oneness. We should compare the church in our locality with the description in this psalm to see whether the church is in oneness or divided. When the church has oneness, the fine oil will flow, and the dew will descend.</p>
<p>The elders are the key to a local church being under the blessing. When there is oneness among the elders, the saints will sing hymns and praise. When the elders lack the oneness, the whole church will suffer; there will be no growth in life, and the church will not be able to go on positively. Hence, the most important thing in our serving the church is the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEN &ldquo;WORMS&rdquo;<br />
THAT DESTROY THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that has kept us in the proper oneness of the church all these years. On the one hand, we worship Him, because although many people have fallen away, we are still on this way. On the other hand, we admit that in many aspects we are still not one. We should ask ourselves whether there is the genuine oneness in our local church. We should not ask whether our church is good or bad but whether it has the genuine oneness. There is oneness in every local church, but that oneness can be damaged, because there are many &ldquo;worms&rdquo; that eat away at our oneness. The oneness in the local churches can be eaten by these worms to such an extent that there is only a thin layer of oneness left. In this chapter we will examine ten worms that destroy the oneness so that we can kill the worms one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Controlling</h2>
<p>A brother who is controlling thinks of himself as being the top elder, the first among the elders; he considers the other elders merely as helpers. This is a big worm. The oneness in many churches has been eaten by this worm. Although several people appear to bear responsibility together in coordination, when something happens, a brother already has an opinion concerning what to do and only goes through the motion of asking others for input. This worm destroys the oneness and must not be allowed.</p>
<p>Whoever wants to be first in the church will be the first to destroy the oneness. From the human viewpoint, there is a need for control so that there will not be chaos in a church with many people. Of course, there must be administration for the sake of orderliness in the church, but administrating is not controlling. Controlling is not allowed. We should not be the one who always voices our opinions and makes decisions. Anything to be decided upon must be presented to the elders so that they may have thorough prayer together and then fellowship. After they fellowship thoroughly, the elders can make decisions. This is the way to kill the first worm.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Insisting On One&rsquo;s Own Views</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has the worm of insisting on his own views. This worm is hard to deal with because it is subtle. Suppose Brother A makes a suggestion that is not accepted by the other elders. Although Brother A may not fight for his suggestion, he privately does things according to his own way. This is to insist on one&rsquo;s own view. Brother A may seemingly drop his suggestion, and he will not say anything further; he will not express any opinions, nor will he fellowship. But by not fellowshipping, he has closed the door to the other brothers. If the suggestion that was accepted by the brothers does not work, he may say that he already knew that it would not work. This should not be practiced among the responsible brothers. The responsible brothers should learn to bring up matters for fellowship without insisting on their views.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Perfecting of the Saints &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
