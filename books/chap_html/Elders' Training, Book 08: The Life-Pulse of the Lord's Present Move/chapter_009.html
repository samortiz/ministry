<h2 class="head1">PLUNDERING EGYPT OF ITS GOLD</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider more concerning the full-timers who would still remain in their job, their profession or business, to make money. Those full-timers remain there to make a gain of the world&rsquo;s gold. When the Israelites left Egypt, they plundered it of its gold (Exo. 11:2-3; 12:35-36). The material gold mine is in Egypt. We need some full-timers to remain there to dig the gold mine to get the gold. The other full-timers will drop their job, profession, or business for the preaching and teaching of the gospel truth, but they will need something to live on. We would not like to see that they would be forced to make tents as Paul was in Acts 18:1-3. That would be a shame to us. If I were there at Paul&rsquo;s time, I would have gone through all the churches to tell them that it was a shame that they would not have fellowship with the Apostle Paul unto the gospel (Phil. 1:5). It was a shame to force him and his co-workers to go back to &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; to get some gold. We must stress to the saints that we are all full-timers in different functions. Some have the function to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to all the seekers. However, these dear ones could not have any time to make a living. They need others to support them. Therefore, a great number of us full-timers should remain in our jobs, professions, or businesses to make money.</p>
<p>It is a great thing to have fellowship unto the gospel. Unto the gospel means for the furtherance of the gospel. All the full-timers who remain in their jobs and businesses need to have this kind of fellowship, a fellowship for the furtherance of the Lord&rsquo;s move through those who do not remain in businesses and jobs, but who are occupied all day with preaching and teaching for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to use the Seventh-Day Adventists as an example, reminding the saints how they practice ten percent tithing. This is too poor. The tithing of ten percent to the Lord is altogether an Old Testament thing, belonging to the law. There was no grace, life, or life power in that. We must be different. We are in the age of grace, which provides us with much supply of life. The dynamic salvation was accepted by Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10. Immediately after being saved, that sinner gave up so much of his worldly possessions. That was not a tithing of ten percent; that was the very issue of the dynamic salvation. Likewise, on the day of Pentecost all those small members had everything in common (Acts 2:44, 45; 4:32-35). This was not one tenth of their possessions but one hundred percent. They put everything at the feet of the apostles, that is, at the Lord&rsquo;s disposal. That was wonderful. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; even this matter has to be recovered.</p>
<p>We have &ldquo;passed beyond all earthly bribe.&rdquo; All the riches could never bribe us. We would not accept any kind of bribe. This is rotten. Any government which receives a bribe is a rotten, ruined government. We would not be ruined; therefore, we have to pass far, far beyond all earthly bribes to God&rsquo;s complete purpose.</p>
<p>In Luke 16:1-13 the Lord Jesus teaches us how to be wise, as the unrighteous steward. The Israelites required gold of the Egyptians. Apparently that was not righteous, but in a sense that was very righteous. The Egyptians had robbed Israel for over two hundred years. The Israelites had no chance to plunder the Egyptians in turn. Now, God&rsquo;s sovereignty subdued Pharaoh, and Pharaoh could do nothing to God&rsquo;s people. God gave His people the chance to plunder them, the more the better, as much as they could. This was altogether righteous because He is a righteous God. Now we are making a gain of the world. Do you think that this is not righteous? This is very righteous because the world has been robbing God our Father for quite a long time. From where did they get their riches? It was from God. Therefore, God sends us back to make a gain of them. Of course, we do not rob them, but we make a gain of the world&rsquo;s riches by our labor, laboring day and night to be very successful. If the people of the world can establish a factory which earns ten million dollars, we had better go today to earn fifty million dollars.</p>
<p>Go back to tell the saints to make a gain of the world in the righteous way, to make more money&mdash;the more the better. However, try your best when you get riches, not to retain one penny. If you would not retain even a penny, you must say to the Devil, &ldquo;I mean business with my Lord. I only use a little part for me and for my family to live on in the proper way.&rdquo; I do not like to see the saints living in a poor way. Neither do I like to see the saints living in a luxurious way. I like to see that the saints have proper homes, and that they put their children in schools, helping them to get the highest degree, if possible, a Ph.D. On occasion I have given money to some of the saints to support their children&rsquo;s education. I like to see as well that all the saints have proper cars, but not too expensive, that they may have a good living. We must save every penny that we can. But we save not for our savings account, but to have something for His spending.</p>
