   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Fellowship of the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to another aspect of the fellowship, that is, the fellowship of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems that there is no problem with the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ; however, when we put this fellowship into practice, immediately it becomes a local fellowship, the fellowship of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being Many in Different Localities</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The local churches are many in different localities Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body of Christ as the church, the unique universal church, is expressed through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is impossible for the Body of Christ to be expressed without the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The local churches, which are the expressions of the unique Body of Christ, are scattered on this earth in the localities where the local churches exist to express the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being Locally Kept Away from One Another,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>but Not Being Divided Universally</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The local churches are locally kept away from one another by their being in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not say that they are separated from one another; the word separated may carry the connotation of division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have used the term kept away because to be kept away is not to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The churches are kept away from one another only by their localities, not by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, they are not divided universally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Local Churches Needing to Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>with All the Genuine Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>on the Whole Earth</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any local church that does not keep this universal fellowship of the Body of Christ is divisive and becomes a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some so-called local churches are not genuine and have become divisions; we do not need to fellowship with such "churches."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we should have fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If not, we are no longer a church but a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A church is one that remains in the Body; a sect is a group of believers who divide themselves from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When my arm remains in the body, it is a part of my living body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it is cut off and separated from the body, it becomes a dead thing.</S>
