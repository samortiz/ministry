<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this Thanksgiving weekend conference. May this conference be a real thanksgiving from us to You. Lord, cover us with Your precious blood. How much we need Your blood and Your anointing, the rich anointing with all the unsearchable riches of the Triune God. Lord, we thank You for the past. Thank You for the present. We even thank You for the coming days. Lord, be with us. We need Your presence. Lord, anoint the whole meeting. Anoint every attendant. Lord, open the heavens and give us a clear sky that we may have a clear view under Your oracle. Take away all the veils, take away all the clouds, and give us Your own revelation. We want to see something. We want not only to hear, but also to see. Lord Jesus, we love You, and we want to see You in this meeting. We want to be touched by You. Touch us, Lord. Touch each one of us, and give to each one of us the particular word that we need. Lord, we thank You again that You are so sovereign. You are on the throne. We worship You, and we give You all the glory, yet we still remember Your enemy. Lord, we are fighting against him. We are always in the battle. Lord, fight the battle for us. Put him aside, and shame him. May all the glory be to You. Lord, may all the blessings be bestowed upon us. Thank You for the church. Thank You for Your oracle today. Speak in our speaking. Lord, we believe You are one with us, one spirit with us, and we believe we are one spirit with You. Thank You for this oneness. We pray in Your mighty name. Amen.</p>
<p>My burden in these messages concerns five intrinsic things. Four concern the church, and one concerns the winds of teaching. The first four intrinsic things of the church are: the intrinsic essence of the church for its organic existence; the intrinsic growth of the church for its organic increase; the intrinsic building up of the church for its organic function; and the intrinsic fellowship of the churches for their organic relationship. The intrinsic essence, the intrinsic growth, the intrinsic building up, and the intrinsic fellowship are all very positive. The last intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching for their evil purpose is a negative item.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
