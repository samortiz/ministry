   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CEASING IN HIS LIFE ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Kings 2:10-11 speaks of David's ceasing in his life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was buried in the city of David v. 10 , after reigning over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron over Judah and thirty-three years in Jerusalem over the entire people of Israel v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to what David had done for Israel, the people should have taken action, at the time of his death, to remember him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, contrary to what we might expect, the Bible does not give us a vivid record telling us that at his death the people expressed their appreciation of him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, the record of the end of David's life on earth is dim and gloomy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the indulgence of David's lust spoiled his splendid life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, the sins committed by Solomon and the thirty-eight kings after him can be traced to David's indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His one indulgence resulted in the loss of the God-given good land by his descendants and in the spoiling of God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the ending of David's life was sad, God's sovereignty nevertheless overcame Satan's subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God still carried out the return from captivity in order to preserve fourteen generations of Christ's genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the return from captivity the good land was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom.</S>
