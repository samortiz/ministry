   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIFE OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian life is a life of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, baptism has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But on the other hand, baptism continues until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, until this goal has been attained, we continue to live a life of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we are daily under the application of the death of Christ as we experience the effectiveness of Christ s death, which is now one of the ingredients, the elements, in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we can experience at that very moment the application of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of exchanging words, we can experience the putting to death of the negative element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This takes place not by doctrine or by a particular practice, but by the killing element in the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A HEAVENLY ANTIBIOTIC</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine life is a heavenly antibiotic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To argue with our husband or wife is to have a cough.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we exchange words with our husband or wife, we are coughing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The death of Christ is the only antibiotic that can eliminate the germs that cause this illness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The heavenly antibiotic not only crucifies us, but also resurrects us and renews the faculties of our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This resurrection and renewing is the genuine growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The process of transformation is both organic and metabolic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is organic because it is related to life, and it is metabolic because it is related to a process in which old elements are discharged and new elements are added.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To change someone s complexion by makeup is neither organic nor metabolic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But a change in complexion that comes through eating nourishing food is both organic and metabolic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a change may be considered a physical transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would be transformed, we must constantly look to the Lord, pray, read the Word, and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way we eat, drink, and breathe the rich supply of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This supply will produce a metabolic change in which the old, negative elements are discharged and replaced by new, positive elements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This metabolic change is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul speaks of beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face the glory of the Lord and of being transformed into His image by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we gaze upon Christ and reflect Him, we are transformed into His image from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is from the Lord Spirit, the very life-giving Spirit mentioned in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 17 clearly says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to bring out the connection between verses 6 and 17, Darby places verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating thereby that verse 17 is the continuation of verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Lord is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we are transformed by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we behold Him, the more we receive His supply and are transformed metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>GROWTH AND SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Transformation includes growth and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we are transformed, we grow and are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, transformation will issue in conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we are transformed, the more we are conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through this process of transformation and conformation, we are brought fully into the divine sonship to be members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we have pointed out, to gain such a Body to express Christ is the goal of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am burdened that all the saints may have the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive, divine life and experience transformation and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not need teaching or self-effort we need a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I pray that the Spirit will enlighten the saints and unveil these matters to them so that they may experience them in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we see the vision of transformation and conformation by the grafted life, 6:8 will become real in our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our having died with Christ will no longer be a mere fact that we believe; it will become our daily experience through the operation of the divine life within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This life both puts us to death and resurrects us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we grow, we are sanctified, and we are transformed.</S>
