   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Intensify His Organic Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to intensify His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The organic salvation, carried out by Him as the pneumatic Christ in the second stage of His inclusion, is already adequately strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the stage of His intensification, however, He intensifies His organic salvation sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For His ministry in the stage of His inclusion, Christ became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, to carry out His organic salvation for the producing of the church and the building up of His Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, on the way of His ministry in the stage of His inclusion, before He had attained His purpose, the church became degraded; such degradation frustrates the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, Christ as the one life-giving Spirit was intensified sevenfold to become the seven Spirits of God Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book of Revelation refers to the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The seven Spirits are not seven individual Spirits, but the one Spirit who is intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the proper interpretation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ has become the seven Spirits, not seven separate Spirits but one sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is our interpretation altogether by cutting straight the word of the truth under the divine guidance and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ became the sevenfold intensified Spirit in order to intensify the organic salvation of God sevenfold for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate God's eternal goal, which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Produce the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to produce the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By ourselves we cannot become overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Overcomers are produced, not worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are produced by Christ in the third stage of His intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Due to the degradation of the church, nearly all the believers in Christ have become defeated in their old man by Satan, sin, the world, and their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, there is the need to have the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, very few believers are not defeated in their old man by Satan, sin, the world, and their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The majority have been defeated and have become defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Look at today's Catholicism and Protestantism, in the midst of which are thousands and thousands of believers, but where are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are hardly any.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The United States as the top country of Christianity today has the greatest number of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, generally speaking, according to the contents of people's conversation and the manner of their dressing and adornment in their workplace, there is simply no way to tell which ones are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many saints have told me that in their workplace, when people return to work on Monday after the weekend, the contents of their conversation are too filthy for one to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can one possibly tell who are the genuine Christians?</S>
