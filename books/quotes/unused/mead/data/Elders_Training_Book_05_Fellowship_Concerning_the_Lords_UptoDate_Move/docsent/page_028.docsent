   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM WITH THE CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One of the troubles with the Corinthians was the overemphasis of the speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speaking with new tongues is one of the five signs listed in Mark 16:17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To speak with new tongues is one of the five miracles listed here which belong to the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first chapter of Corinthians Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son v. 9 , who is God s power and God s wisdom to us v. 24 . Christ became wisdom to us from God as righteousness and sanctification and redemption v. 30 . First Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This book unveils Christ as nineteen wonderful items for our enjoyment see note 9 2 in 1 Corinthians 1 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not one of the nineteen items of Christ revealed in 1 Corinthians indicates any kind of miraculous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these nineteen items of Christ indicate life and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Corinthians 14, Paul restricted the abuse and the overuse of tongue speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He told the Corinthians clearly that to speak in tongues does not build the church but prophecy does v. 4 . Paul encouraged the saints in Corinth to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One of the reasons for the problems with the Corinthians was their exaltation of the miraculous speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE PROBLEM WITH THE GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The problem with the Galatians was that they were seduced back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul indicated in his Epistle to them that it was absolutely wrong for them to go back to the law because today is the day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What God is mainly doing in the age of grace is to reveal His Son in us Gal 1:16a that His Son may live in us Gal 2:20a , that His Son may be formed in us Gal 4:19 , and that we may be clothed with His Son Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEBREWS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we must see what the problem was with the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They had been enlightened, they had tasted of the heavenly gift, they had received the Holy Spirit, and were even partaking of this Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They had also tasted the good word of God, but they remained in the initial stage of the enjoyment of the New Testament blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of the Christ mentioned in 6:1, which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The good word of God is milk, whereas the word of righteousness is solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hebrews 5:12 says, For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse tells us that the word of God is likened to milk and solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The rudiments or primary elements of the beginning of the oracles of God are in the category of the word as milk not as solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 13 continues, For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us are familiar with the word of life and the word of grace, but I do not think many Christians have a thought concerning the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word of righteousness is the solid food and is not for babes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word of righteousness is a word on a higher level and is something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul s use of the word inexperienced indicates that we need to experience the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the point of our regeneration in the Lord we began to know the word of life Phil 2:16 , the word of grace Acts 20:32 , the word of the truth Eph 1:13 , and the word of the gospel Acts 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We not only acquired the knowledge of these kinds of words, but we also had the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how many of us have adequately experienced the word of righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 14 says, But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To fully enter into the word of righteousness, we need experience and we need exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The entire revelation of the book of Hebrews shows us that Christ has an earthly ministry and also a heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His earthly ministry, He was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through that ministry we were all redeemed back to God through repentance from dead works and of faith toward God Heb 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through His earthly ministry we were also baptized into Him 6:2a and all our negative things were washed away and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Repentance from dead works, faith toward God, and baptism are mentioned as the beginning of the doctrine concerning Christ, the good word of God, in Hebrews 6:1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To merely tell people in preaching the gospel that Christ was the Son of God who died on the cross for sinners is to preach the good word of God referring to Christ s ministry on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Hebrews received the gospel to this extent, but they never realized that Christ has another ministry, a ministry in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now they must go on from the good word of God to the deeper word, the word of righteousness 5:13 , which is not mainly concerned with God s redemption but with the way of His economy, and which is the solid food for them to reach maturity 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the book of Hebrews was written to bring the Hebrew believers on from the good word of God concerning Christ s earthly ministry to the word of righteousness concerning His heavenly ministry, from the first, initial stage of God s salvation to the full stage of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This book s intention is to bring the childish believers on to maturity, from the earth to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It even tells us that we are partakers of a heavenly calling 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews also mentions the heavenly gifts 6:4 , the heavenly things 8:5 , the heavenly country 11:16 , and the heavenly Jerusalem 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually this book points out to us that today the very Christ who died on the cross and who made the new covenant for us is now in the heavens as the heavenly Minister, the heavenly High Priest, and the heavenly Mediator of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is in the heavenlies to minister all the blessings of God s New Testament economy into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Hebrew believers were remaining in the initial stage of salvation and would not go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Hebrews 6:1 Paul says, Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word of the beginning of the Christ is the good word of God mentioned in 6:5.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Leaving the good word of God, we need to be brought on to maturity, which is to advance from Christ s earthly ministry to His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The heavenly Christ is in the Holy of Holies in the heavenly tabernacle and the way into the Holy of Holies has been made for us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we all have to enter into the Holy of Holies in the heavens where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Hebrews 6:4 and 5 we saw that the Hebrew believers had tasted four things which are the genuine blessings assigned to us for the new creation the heavenly light, the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, and the good word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition to this, the Hebrews had also tasted the works of power of the coming age, the miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Hebrew believers had tasted, in the first stage of God s salvation, the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This shows us that miracles are not in the stage of God s full salvation, but in the initial stage of God s salvation.</S>
