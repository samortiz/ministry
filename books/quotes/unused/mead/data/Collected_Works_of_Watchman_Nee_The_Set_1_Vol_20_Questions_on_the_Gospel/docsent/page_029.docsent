   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-TWO CONCERNING 1 CORINTHIANS 15:3 AND 17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why does verse 17 say that if Christ has not been raised, we are yet in our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 3 speaks of Christ's death, which is related to the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 17 speaks of Christ's resurrection, which is also related to the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is the problem of sins mentioned in verse 3 solved by the death of Christ, whereas the problem of sins mentioned in verse 17 is solved by the resurrection of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today gospel preachers have an inclination to put an adequate emphasis on Christ's death but not on Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In many places we hear people say that Christ's death delivers us from sins, but we seldom hear people say that Christ's resurrection delivers us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The death of Christ delivered us from the punishment of sins and canceled the record of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to be delivered from the power of sins, there must be the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "sins" in verse 3 is plural in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It implies the individual acts of sin, the sins committed day to day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He suffered the punishment for our sins and bore them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, that was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the book of Acts, did the apostles speak more about death or more about resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider 1 Corinthians 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Was Paul trying to prove the death of Christ or the resurrection of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that the apostle put the emphasis on Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The world believes that the Lord Jesus has died; but it is not easy for them to believe that He died to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we know that the purpose of the Lord Jesus' death was to bear our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus' resurrection solves this problem and proves that His death was for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem of sins was solved; therefore, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we tell someone that the Lord Jesus has died for his sins, and if the Holy Spirit reveals the resurrected Christ to him, he will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the resurrection of Christ can prove that Christ's death is for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only does the Lord Jesus' resurrection prove that His death is for our sins, His resurrection also gives us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus had to die for us; He also resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are sinners; the Lord Jesus has died for and propitiated our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But can we live before God by our flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus' death paid for our old debts, but His death cannot guarantee that we will not incur new debts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord had to resurrect and put a new life into us so that we can live differently from before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Death clears our record of sins, whereas resurrection enables us to not sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus not only died and propitiated our sins before God; He also resurrected and now lives in us, bearing our hardships and enabling us to overcome sins and temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though His death paid our old debts, we would still not have the strength to avoid new debts if the Lord Jesus had not resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, He had to be raised in order to solve future problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We not only have to believe that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins, but we also have to realize that He has resurrected and now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are regenerated by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has put a new life into us; this life is a resurrection life with no bounds, which will raise us in the same way Christ was raised.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people make a basic mistake of receiving only the work of the Lord Jesus' death but not the work of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some Christians often feel that their circumstances are too difficult and their families have too many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because they think the temptations are too real, they cannot overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to be clear that even though the temptations are real, the Christ who dwells in us is also real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God puts us in difficult circumstances for two reasons: 1 He wants to prove to us the reality of the Christ who lives in us, and 2 He wants us to be satisfied with the reality of the Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can overcome sins not just once or twice but many times by the Christ who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people only pay attention to an outward Savior and forget the Savior who lives in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They only pay attention to the Savior at Golgotha but forget about the Savior who dwells in them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet the life within us is real and can overcome any temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have clearly seen that death has solved the problem of sins, and resurrection has given us a new life that enables us not to sin.</S>
