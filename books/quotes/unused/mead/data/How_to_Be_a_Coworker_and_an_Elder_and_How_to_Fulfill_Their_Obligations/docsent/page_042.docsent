   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Not Living with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The co-workers and elders also have to beware of not living with Christ, not walking, working, and moving with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people walk, but not with Christ; they work, but not with Christ; and they move, but not with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet they acknowledge that Christ dwells in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Surely, Christ is dwelling in us, but we often ignore Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not know how many times I have confessed my sins to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I just made a phone call, but I didn't do it with You."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proper thing to do is to say, "Lord, now I am going to make a phone call.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I desire that You make this phone call with me and that I make this phone call with You."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How beautiful this would be!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes I felt that my wife had a shortcoming in a certain aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I prayed, "Lord, I want to fellowship with her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you don't go with me, that means You don't want me to do it; then I won't do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If You want me to do it, You have to do it with me and I with You."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is my experience of living with Christ in my personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a newly written hymn there are these two lines: "No longer I alone that live,/But God together lives with me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our daily life must be "God together lives with me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot just say this in our prayers and sing this in our hymns, and not live together with God day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are too free.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we want to make a phone call, we do it instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we want to write a letter, we do it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are short of the experience of living with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often, as soon as I left my seat to go and do something, I had to sit down because I was going alone without the Lord; I had to ask the Lord to forgive me for acting alone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consider as a Christian how many things you have done by yourself alone and not by you with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be a co-worker you have to do everything in the work with the Lord; to be an elder you have to do everything in the eldership with the Lord; even to shepherd the brothers and sisters you have to do everything with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord is our Chief Shepherd and our great Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It must be He who is in us urging us to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unless the Lord is doing the shepherding, how can we be shepherds?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we go to visit a brother and the Lord goes with us, that truly makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you go to visit a brother, you must have the Lord going with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must not go simply because you have the burden and the willingness to go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you go in this way, your visiting will be futile.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You do not have the Spirit, the life, or the Lord; you are acting alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before you go, you must pray to the Lord, "Lord, I pray that You would give me a real burden to visit this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am in fear and trembling before You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am afraid of bringing myself there to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have mercy on me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If You do not go with me, I will not go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, enable me to speak with You, and You must speak with me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although I am a shepherd to this brother, I want to take You as my Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless You shepherd me, how can I shepherd him?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do this, you are one who lives entirely with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are not in the old creation but in the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, when you go, the sensation, the flavor, and the atmosphere that you give him are simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to minister Christ, to dispense Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, dispensing Christ and ministering Christ become mere terminology that is found in our messages and hymns but is rarely seen in our daily life.</S>
