   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT SOWING THE SEED OF DEATH AND DISSENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who have learned the lesson will say Amen when the elders decide that the group meetings should study the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who feel that this book is too long should be helped by those who have learned this lesson to submit to the church and respect the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must first help the saints to accept the arrangement of the elders before suggesting that a shorter book be studied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Helping the saints in this way is beautiful and contains the element of building in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If, out of an impure motive, a responsible one doubts the decision of the elders and shares his feeling with other responsible ones, the factor of death will be spread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He might not slander or oppose the elders, but in his speaking he may spread the thought of the church being a dictator.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will cause dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The seed of dissension that is sown into the saints can grow and eventually cause them to be in dissension with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is tearing down God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even in our preaching of the gospel and our edifying of the saints there may be a factor of tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This can be compared to drinking a cup of tea that contains the tuberculosis bacteria.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After drinking the tea, we will contract tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a serious matter if a brother, who did not possess a dissenting heart before being edified by us, begins to express an element of dissension in his service after being edified by us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A local church is finished if all the saints are dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be aware of this great danger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The most cunning scheme of Satan is to sow the seed of dissension through the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he does this, the work of the Lord is disrupted and there is discord in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person who has contracted tuberculosis may appear healthy, but within a year his entire being will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO BUILD UP BEING TO MUTUALLY SUPPORT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND SUPPLY ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our problem is that we consider ourselves to be so smart and capable that we do not need one another; we are always stepping on others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an indication of discord with the element of tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not building up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who truly build up the church feel that they cannot act independently and cannot be without the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They feel that they need others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When ministering the word, such a one needs the brothers and sisters to pray for him, to support him in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a spirit seems to have disappeared from our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who minister the word do not seem to need the prayer of others, and those in the audience do not have a supporting spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They just listen to the speakers and make comparisons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a spirit is intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the seed of dissension that is in our midst bears fruit, then the church, our service, and the work will collapse and fall apart even though we may be more spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our labor has not brought people into one accord with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, we seem to only be causing dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we help people, the more they seem to dissent from the church and are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is tearing down, not building up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In particular, the brothers and sisters who work with the young people do not have the feeling of depending on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should all be of one soul to pray for, supply, and support whoever is speaking a message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If those who serve the Lord are continually disagreeing, instead of being in one accord, the enemy, the saints, and even the children will know it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BUILDING BEING SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Real building depends on submission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To submit is to be in subjection to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are willing to submit, there will be the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Submission is not an issue if only one person is working.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we are working together, we must not simply care for our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, submission is not an issue before a brother and sister are married, but after they are married, they must learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only when there is submission can there be building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a brother and a sister are married, their purpose is to build up a family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The foundation of this building depends on submission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The emphasis of building is not on obeying but on submitting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a wife does not submit to her husband and a husband does not submit to his wife, their family will lack the building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must believe that the elders in a local church are not careless in their decisions and that they are not authoritarian in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they may feel that they are weak and inadequate, they bear a great responsibility and take care of the church in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If all the elders have this kind of attitude and spirit, their decisions are deserving of our submission.</S>
