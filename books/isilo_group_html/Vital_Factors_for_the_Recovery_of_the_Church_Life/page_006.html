<p>After He died and was buried, on the third day He rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:3-4). In His resurrection He accomplished two main things: first, He imparted the divine life into His believers for their regeneration (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3), and, second, He became a life-giving Spirit to impart the Triune God essentially into His believers as their life and life supply (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is a profound matter. After He completed everything through His death, in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His disciples to bring the processed Triune God into them as their life and life supply. Hallelujah! Today the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwells us to impart the processed Triune God into our being as our life and our life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ASCENDING TO THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>Forty days after His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens (Acts 1:9-11). He died, He rose, and He ascended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Made the Lord and the Christ</h2>
<p>He ascended to the heavens to be made the Lord and the Christ (Acts 2:36). He was made the Lord in His ascension to possess the universe. Jesus is the Owner of the entire universe. We all need to realize that He is our Lord. He is our Possessor and He is our Owner. He is also God&rsquo;s Christ to carry out God&rsquo;s commission and to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Today in the heavens Jesus is the Lord of the entire universe, and there in the heavens He is carrying out God&rsquo;s commission. He is the Lord, and He is the Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Made Head Over All Things to the Church</h2>
<p>In the heavens Christ was also made the Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23). What He is as the Head over all things is for the formation of the church, which is His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pouring Out the Spirit Economically on His Body</h2>
<p>In His ascension, Christ poured out Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His Body (Acts 2:33). By the outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit, all His believers were baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). Thus, the issue of the six items in this chapter concerning the Person and work of Christ is that He has obtained a Body for His expression.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Vital Factors for the Recovery of the Church Life &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
