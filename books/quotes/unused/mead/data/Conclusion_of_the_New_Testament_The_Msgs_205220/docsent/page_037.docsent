   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 7 THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider the church as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>E. The Counterpart of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his exhortation in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul presents the church as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This reveals that the church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam Gen 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, is a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His creation, God did not create a man and woman at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He first created a man, and then from the man He created a counterpart to help him Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle were brought before Adam, Adam named them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But for Adam "there was not found a help meet for him" Gen 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam desired to have a counterpart, to have someone to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, among the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle, he could not find his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to produce such a counterpart, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam Gen 2:21 , and He took a rib out of Adam and built a woman with the rib Gen 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The name of the woman was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eve was the same as Adam in life, nature, and form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, she could be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God brought Eve to Adam, Adam exclaimed, "This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" Gen 2:23, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At last, Adam had found one who could be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 2:24 indicates that a man and his wife are one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The husband and the wife are two halves of a whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a marvelous picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eve had the same life and nature that Adam had.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This signifies that the church has the same life and nature that Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, Eve had virtually the same image and nearly the same stature as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the church bears the same image and has the same stature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church as the counterpart of Christ implies satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every husband needs satisfaction and rest, which are found in love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The brothers who are husbands can testify that our satisfaction and rest can only be in our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we say that we are the church, then we must ask if Christ has His rest among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A group of Christians should not be so quick to claim that they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be the church is to render to Christ the adequate satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ needs such a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is not merely a gathering of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church, as Christ's counterpart, is a satisfaction and rest to Christ in love.</S>
