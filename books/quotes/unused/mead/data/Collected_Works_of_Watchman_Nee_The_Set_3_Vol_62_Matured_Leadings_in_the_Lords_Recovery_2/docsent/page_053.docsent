   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our daily life we have to walk according to the leading of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our mind can help us in receiving guidance from the Holy Spirit; it can help us to make decisions in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose we are responsible for keeping the record of the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of form should we use?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are over ten different kinds of forms we can choose from.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we pick up one, we feel peaceful within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is the one that God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we have selected the form, we have to decide when we will print it and when we will pass it out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all of these matters, we have to act according to the inward feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we need a form, yet do not have the right mind to design or choose one, our spirit will be bound because God's will is not being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that man's mind can aid the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose we saw a thief crawling into our neighbor's house last night.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the police station summons us, and we are shown many photographs of suspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In examining them, we find one which resembles the man we saw last night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can identify him because he left a strong impression on us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the way the mind works with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the mind comes across something that matches the feeling of the spirit, the spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes people come up with many points in their mind, but their spirit cannot say amen to these points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another may present a few points from his mind, and the spirit responds immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that our mind must be properly trained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, we will be like a policeman presenting an identifier with eighty thousand pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there are too many choices, whatever impression we have may vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to train our mind to the extent that our spirit will respond with an amen as soon as we touch a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times saints ask, "Why am I always wrong and other persons are always right in our coordination together?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I always answer, "You have all the reasons, but something within you cannot say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What are you going to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not here to know whether our reasons are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are here to see if our spirit says amen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>READING THE BIBLE WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND PRAYING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us now consider how we can follow the sense of the spirit in our reading of the Bible and in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are two ways to read the Bible and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One way is by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other way is by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we only use our mind, not our spirit, the words of the Bible will become letters to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like a body that is without life; it is merely a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that the mind helps us understand teachings and doctrines, but if the Holy Spirit does not move, we will not receive any life John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit is also in the words of the Bible 6:63; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within us there is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man does not have the Spirit within him, he does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a word of the Bible does not have the Spirit behind it, it is not God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem is that there are two kinds of words of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One is the outward word of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The other is the word of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word we have touched depends on which organ we are using.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can only touch the Spirit in the Bible if we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose Brother Ma and Brother Chia are colleagues at work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They only have business contact with each other in the office; there is no spiritual communication or fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although both are Christians, neither knows about the other's conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day they meet each other in the cashier's office, and each wants to preach the gospel to the other and bring the other to the church to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then they discover that both are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way they become related to each other on a different level the spiritual level.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From that time onward, the two not only have business contact, but spiritual contact as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way we have a spirit within us, and the Spirit is within the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not use our spirit, our outer man will only touch the physical Bible; we will not touch the Spirit within the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible says that a prophet is not without honor except in his own country Matt 13:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is because one's own countrymen know his background and everything related to him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They can only know him by the outward flesh; they cannot know him by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we come to the Bible, there are doctrines, teachings, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if we know it only by these outward things, we only will have doctrines, teachings, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will not touch the Spirit which speaks from behind the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our fellowship is not merely a matter of inviting a brother over to eat and drink; it is the communication of our spirit with others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Fellowship is not a few cups of tea, a dish of snacks, or five hours of conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fellowship is the communication of spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our spirit must be always ready, like a weak and hungry man ready for food.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we come to the Word thus prepared, we will receive the supply of life from God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are two kinds of words in the Bible: black and white letters, and words that supply our spirit with life and power, satisfying our inward needs.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In reading the Bible, we should not touch the doctrines of the Bible only but also should receive the supply in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Likewise, listening to a message requires the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we listen to a message and are only impressed with the eloquence, the clarity of mind, and the lucid logic of the speaker, we only have knowledge and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In order to receive supply from the speaker, we have to exercise our spirit to contact the spirit behind the words.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will receive help not only from his words but from his spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The proper attitude in reading the Bible is to have our spirit stronger than our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should be like the baby bird during times of feeding; its mouth is bigger than its head.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The mind is one mouth, but there needs to be another mouth the spirit's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we practice this, our spirit will be greatly uplifted and fully nourished after a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the reason our spirit must be wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the spirits of all the brothers and sisters are wide open, we can tell whether or not a speaker is exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This does not mean that those who speak louder and stronger are exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not a matter of how loud the voice is or how polished the eloquence is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is a matter of the echo in the spirit and the supply in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A man's mind can be deceived, but a man's spirit cannot be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we have the spirit, we have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do not have the spirit, we do not have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some messages are structured with good introductions and conclusions, but they do not necessarily convey the spirit.</S>
