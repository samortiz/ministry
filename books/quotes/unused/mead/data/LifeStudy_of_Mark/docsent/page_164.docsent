   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT UPON THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 1:10 tells us what happened when the Lord Jesus came up out of the water: And immediately, coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being parted, and the Spirit as a dove coming down to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before this time, the Lord Jesus already had God the Father within Him as the essence of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After His baptism, God the Spirit descended upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, within Him the Lord Jesus had the divine essence, and upon Him He had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the One with the Father within Him as His essence and the Spirit upon Him as the power for His move and work, He began to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His move, His work, the Lord Jesus was not a person merely of morality or ethics, and He was not a person of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, the Lord Jesus was a person absolutely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After His baptism, with the Spirit upon Him, the Lord Jesus was a person absolutely of God inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Inwardly He had God the Father as His essence; outwardly He had the Spirit of God as His power to move, act, minister, and preach.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way He became not a person of culture, religion, or merely ethics or morality, but a person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WHOLLY IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His move on earth, what did the Lord Jesus do?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did He teach ethics or morality?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Did He emphasize religion, culture, or education?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did He tell people to keep the Ten Commandments given by God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are not the things the Lord Jesus did in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was altogether in another kingdom, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was not in the kingdom of law, morality, ethics, religion, or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was wholly in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may be so bold as to say that the kingdom of God is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us use the animal kingdom as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The animal kingdom, of course, is composed of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there were no animals, there would not be an animal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle is the same with the kingdom of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kingdom of man is mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a similar way, the kingdom of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus was a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever He did, whatever He preached and taught, the way He behaved and ministered everything was in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Confucius taught ethics, and he was in the kingdom of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ethics is good, but it is not the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moses emphasized the keeping of the law, and he was in the kingdom of law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kingdom is also good, but it is not the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Aaron the high priest taught the people the proper way to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, Aaron was in the kingdom of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This too was good, but it is not the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord Jesus came out to minister, He did not teach ethics, the keeping of the law, or the priestly service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He lived, moved, and acted in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, the kingdom of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE CONTENTS OF THE LORD S GOSPEL SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1:14-45 we see the contents of the Lord s gospel service: preaching the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>14-20 , teaching the truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>21-22 , casting out demons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>23-28 , healing the sick vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>29-39 , and cleansing the leper vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>40-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are not matters of ethics, morality, culture, philosophy, or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the ways the Lord Jesus served God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He served God by preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible does not say that the work of the Lord Jesus was to preach the gospel, teach the truth, cast out demons, heal the sick, and cleanse the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, the New Testament indicates that this was His move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After He was baptized and after the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, He moved in the way of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He moved into Galilee, He preached.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He came to Capernaum, He taught.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He also cast out an unclean spirit, and later He healed Peter s mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, in His move in His ministry He met a leper and cleansed him.</S>
