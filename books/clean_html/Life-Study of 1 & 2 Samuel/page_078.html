Samuel Having Died</H2><P>First Samuel 28:3a tells us that Samuel was dead and that all Israel had mourned for him and had buried him in his own city, Ramah.

Saul Having the Mediums<br>and the Soothsayers Put Out of the Land</H2><P>By the time of chapter twenty-eight Saul had the mediums and the soothsayers put out of the land (v. 3b). Since mediums and soothsayers contact evil spirits, Saul did a good thing in having them removed from the country of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Philistines<br>Gathering Together against Israel,<br>and Saul Being Greatly Afraid of Them</H2><P>The Philistines gathered together against Israel, and Saul was greatly afraid of them (vv. 4-5). He was afraid because his courage and boldness had been taken away by God. God is our real encouragement and boldness. Without Him, we have nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D.

Saul Seeking a Medium and Inquiring of Her</H2><P>Saul sought a medium and inquired of her (vv. 7-11). In chapter fifteen Samuel had warned Saul that his rebellion was like the sin of divination (v. 23). But here in chapter twenty-eight Saul practiced divination, which involves contact with evil spirits and is even worse than idol worship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Samuel Coming and Speaking to Saul</H2><P>Without the medium doing anything, Samuel came and spoke to Saul (vv. 12-19). Samuel told Saul that Jehovah had turned away from him and had become his adversary (v. 16). Then Samuel told Saul that Jehovah had torn the kingdom out from his hand and had given it to David, an associate of his (v. 17). Finally, Samuel told Saul that Jehovah would also give Israel with Saul into the hand of the Philistines and that the next day he and his sons would be destroyed (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G.
