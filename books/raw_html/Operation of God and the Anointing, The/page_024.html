        <h2 class="head1">AN UNOPENED MIND BEING THE RESULT<br />
OF SEEKING THINGS OTHER THAN THE LORD</h2>
<p>When the Lord was ministering on the earth, the minds of the disciples who were with Him were not opened. Some people may think that the minds of the disciples were not opened because the Holy Spirit had not yet been given. The disciples received the Holy Spirit on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (John 20:22), but their minds were not opened immediately. They saw the Lord outwardly, but they did not see Him inwardly. Luke 24:45 indicates that He opened the minds of the disciples to understand the Scriptures when He stood in their midst on the evening of His resurrection. Why did the Lord wait until after His resurrection, not before, to open their minds? The Lord could not open their minds before His resurrection, because their hearts were zealous in a natural way. Moreover, they were veiled because of their impure intentions.</p>
<p>Various situations in the four Gospels indicate that while the disciples were following the Lord, the Lord was not their aim. For example, on the way to Jerusalem the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was about to be crucified and that on the third day He would be raised (Matt. 20:18-19). After He finished speaking, the mother of the two sons of Zebedee said to Him, &ldquo;Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom&rdquo; (v. 21; Mark 10:37). Not only so, the disciples argued with one another concerning who was greater (9:33-34; Luke 22:24). This shows that although they followed the Lord, they pursued things other than the Lord and desired to gain something for themselves.</p>
<p>After the Lord resurrected, the disciples who had followed Him did not gain anything earthly. They did not have earthly enjoyment or blessings, nor did they receive the things they requested. In the Gospels the disciples had sought to gain something for themselves when they followed the Lord. In Acts, however, the disciples followed the Lord not for their own gain but for the Lord Himself. The turning point was in Luke 24. The first thing the Lord Jesus did when He appeared to the two disciples was to unveil Himself to them. When the Lord expounded the Scriptures to them, He revealed Himself, the resurrected and ascended Christ, to them. His words showed them that they should pursue only Christ, who had passed through sufferings and entered into glory; they should no longer seek to gain something for themselves. Hence, when they sat down in the house, their eyes were opened (v. 31).</p>
<p>The record in the Bible is very meaningful. In Luke 24 the Lord Jesus did not bring any bread, but in John 21 He prepared bread for the disciples (vv. 12-13). In John it seems that the disciples felt hopeless when the Lord Jesus left after His resurrection. Because they were without faith, Peter took the lead to go fishing, and the other disciples followed (v. 3). This was the situation when the Lord appeared to them and asked, &ldquo;Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?&rdquo; (v. 5). When the disciples got out of the boat and onto the land, &ldquo;they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord did this to show the disciples that He could support them without their relying on the sea. The disciples caught nothing the whole night (v. 3), but at the Lord&rsquo;s word, they cast their net and caught a hundred and fifty-three large fish (vv. 6, 11). The Lord did not use any of the hundred fifty-three fish; rather, He brought the bread and the fish (v. 13). The Lord wanted them to learn the lesson of living by faith instead of relying on the world. After the disciples ate and were satisfied, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; (v. 15). Here the Lord&rsquo;s intention was not to open their eyes but to touch their heart.</p>
<p>The situation in Luke 24 is different from the situation in John 21. In Luke the Lord did not bring bread to the disciples; the disciples prepared the bread. This situation is a great turning point and shows how a person&rsquo;s mind can be opened. Those who are content with receiving bread from the Lord cannot have their eyes opened. Only those who offer the bread in their hands to the Lord and let Him break it can have their eyes opened. If we are willing to put the things that we cling to and depend upon for our livelihood into the Lord&rsquo;s hand and let Him break them, our eyes will be opened.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the eyes of the disciples were not opened, because they sought things other than the Lord. On the way to Emmaus the Lord showed the two disciples that those who follow Him should seek only Him. In order to follow the Lord, a person needs to hand himself over to the Lord unreservedly. In John 21 the Lord brought bread in order to touch the heart of the disciples, but in Luke 24 when the disciples committed their livelihood into the Lord&rsquo;s hand and let the Lord break it, their eyes were opened.</p>
<p>When we follow the Lord zealously, we often seek other things. We may be zealous and pursue the Lord, but our motives and intentions are questionable, for we often seek things other than the Lord. This will continue until the day that we receive mercy from the Lord to see that we are following Him for our own gain and benefit. Such a seeing will cause us to place our &ldquo;bread&rdquo; into His hand. Our situation is not like Peter&rsquo;s, who in John 21 received bread from the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Rather, our situation is like that of the disciples, who in Luke 24 handed bread to the Lord and let Him break it. This is the way for our eyes to be opened so that we may see the Lord and know Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HANDING OURSELVES TO THE LORD UNRESERVEDLY</h2>
<p>Many saints have not had their mind opened, because they are still seeking something for themselves. This situation will continue until by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy they see that He is the Lord, He is Christ, He is appointed by God, and He is also the goal in God&rsquo;s plan. When we pursue Him and are for Him one hundred percent, not wanting anything for ourselves, our consecration will be genuine. The bread placed in the Lord&rsquo;s hand represented the genuine consecration of the disciples. It was also the means for the disciples&rsquo; minds to be opened. We must be led by the Lord to see that God visits us and gives grace to us, not for ourselves but for Christ.</p>
<p>We often give thanks and praise because we have received a blessing from the Lord. This proves that we have not been delivered from our sphere, our preference, and our requests. A brother may drop his job and forsake the world in order to serve the Lord. However, it is possible for his service to the Lord to be for himself. Such a brother may have a personal seeking. We are the same as the disciples in the Gospels; they were full of mixture in their zeal for the Lord because they sought their personal gain and had their own goals. It was not until after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection that they pursued the Lord for Himself. The bread that the Lord broke signified their consecration, which was not for themselves; hence, their eyes could be opened. It was then that the disciples handed themselves over to the Lord and learned to follow the anointing and receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit in their environment. Otherwise, they might have remained in their former condition.</p>
<p>Before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the disciples lived in themselves; after His resurrection, they lived in the Lord and did not seek anything in the world or in the Lord for themselves. When the disciples did not seek worldly things or spiritual things for themselves, the Lord broke the bread they consecrated and caused their eyes to be opened. It was also at this point that He opened their minds and caused them to understand the Scriptures. Their minds could not be opened until this time.</p>
<p>It is possible for a person whose eyes are not opened to zealously and earnestly seek the Lord. Our basic problem is the self. The greatest problem in our pursuing of the Lord is our self-seeking. This serious, subjective, and hidden veil will prevent us from seeing light. When we receive mercy to see that everything God has is for Christ, not for ourselves, and that the blessings we receive are for Christ, we will surrender ourselves to Him, hand ourselves over to Him, and stop our self-seeking. Then our minds will be opened.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
