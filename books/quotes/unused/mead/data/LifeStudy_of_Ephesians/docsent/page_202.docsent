   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have considered two negative things that damage the church life: ordinances and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to a third negative thing the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some Christians interpret the old man in 4:22 as the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that the old man includes the old nature, but it also includes a great deal more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:22 indicates that the old man is all- inclusive: That you have put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here Paul speaks of putting off, as regards our former manner of life, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The former manner of life includes everything related to us: what we are, what we have, our family life, and our social life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul s meaning here is that we must put off whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are to put off our very way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The old man with all it includes is a damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever the old man is, there can be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that what we are, what we have, and what we do make the church life an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ordinances, doctrine, and the old man are the three main negative things that damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have ordinances, the church life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are occupied with doctrine, it will not be possible to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, if we continue to live according to the old man, the church life will be seriously damaged, even terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we have no ordinances or doctrines and if we put off the old man with his former manner of life, we shall have a marvelous church life, a church life that will be a miniature of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a church life it is impossible to have division.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wish to say once again that in the Lord s recovery we are not for ordinances or for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we have deep respect for the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the Lord s mercy, we would never break His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we do not take the Bible as mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To keep the Word in a living way is one thing, but to turn the revelations in the Word into doctrine is another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to take the Word as nourishment for growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not take it as a book of doctrine and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although I prefer to kneel down when I pray, I do not make this a formality or an ordinance that others are expected to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, when I kneel to pray, I do so in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FLEXIBILITY FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the church life, we must have no ordinances, we must not be occupied with doctrine, and we must not have any oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would be free from oldness, we must lay aside what we are, what we do, and the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are released from oldness in this way are very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Paul was on the way to Damascus, he was altogether in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had strongly opposed Stephen and consented to his death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being strong in the old man, Paul was for the temple, the priests, and for the religion of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He strongly reacted against those who opposed these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, after he came to the Lord and had been dealt with by Him, he became flexible, seemingly without opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 Corinthians 9 he said that he could be all things to all men v. 22 . He could be flexible because he had put aside his old man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During the early years of my ministry, I had much to say to those who came to me for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, if a brother consulted me about marriage, I had many points to share with him concerning married life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But now when the saints come to me for counsel, I do not have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mainly, I encourage them to contact the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My desire is to be like Paul, to be one who has given up the old man and who has become flexible in dealing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have truly put off the old man, others will have a difficult time describing us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if we can be described easily, we probably have not put off the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not be proud, and we should not be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, we should be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall be useful in the church life.</S>
