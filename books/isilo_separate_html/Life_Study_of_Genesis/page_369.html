After the camels had finished drinking, the servant put a golden ring on Rebekah's nose and two bracelets upon her hands (v. 22, Heb.). The best way to catch a person is to catch his nose. That Rebekah had a ring on her nose and bracelets upon her hands meant that she had been caught. After giving her these things, the servant asked her, "Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?" (v. 23). Once the servant was brought into Rebekah's home, he testified of Isaac's riches. After Rebekah's brother Laban and father Bethuel accepted the servant's proposal, he gave Rebekah more of Isaac's riches, articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment (v. 53). He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. This is exactly what John 16:13-15 reveals concerning the Spirit. In these verses, the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will not speak of Himself, but that He will glorify the Son. All that the Father has is His, and the Spirit receives of His and discloses it to the disciples. Suppose Abraham's servant had said to Laban, "It is difficult for Abraham to earn a living in Canaan, and his son Isaac is not healthy. I have been sent to get a helper for him." Do you think that after hearing such a thing Rebekah would have said, "I will go"? No, she would have run away instead. But the testimony of Abraham's servant was not poor; rather, it was very rich. The servant said that the Lord had blessed his master Abraham, that he had become great, that he had given all things to his son Isaac, and that his master had charged him to find a wife for his son. As Rebekah was listening to this testimony, she was attracted to Isaac and was willing to go to him.</P><P>This is a picture of how the Holy Spirit comes to us testifying of the riches of Christ. Today Christ is the One appointed to inherit all the riches of the Father. We know this because the Spirit has told us of it through the Scriptures. Because of the Spirit's testimony, we have all been attracted to Christ. Every saved one who loves and seeks the Lord has been attracted in this way. We do not care for the things that the worldlings are seeking. We enjoy coming to the church meetings and telling the Lord Jesus how much we love Him. Oh, we love Him, we seek Him, and we praise Him! Over and over we say, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</P><P>Rebekah realized the riches of Isaac through the gifts which Abraham's servant brought forth to her. Today we realize the riches of Christ, which He has received of the Father, through the gifts that the Spirit has dispensed to us. Before Rebekah met Isaac in the good land, she had participated in and enjoyed Isaac's inheritance. It is the same with us in partaking of Christ's inheritance. Before we meet Him, we enjoy the gifts of the Spirit as a foretaste of the full taste of His riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(c) To Convince the Bride</H2><P>The Spirit also convinces the bride (vv. 54-58). After the servant, typifying the Spirit, brought Rebekah the riches, she was convinced and was willing to marry Isaac. Although her relatives wanted her to linger, Rebekah, upon hearing the servant's testimony of Isaac, said, "I will go" (v. 58). She was willing to go to Isaac in the land of Canaan. Likewise, we are willing to go to Christ. Although we have never seen Him, we have been attracted by Him and we love Him (1 Pet. 1:8). Although Rebekah had never met Isaac, she loved him. When she heard about him, she simply loved him and wanted to go to a land far off to be with him. As long as we have the willingness to go to Christ, it is a sign that we are the chosen Rebekah. As I have watched the young people loving Jesus, I have said, "What are all these young people doing here? Why don't they seek the things of the world?" But deep within, I know the reason. We have all been convinced that Christ is the wonderful One. He is the most lovable One in the whole universe. How we love Him! As Rebekah was riding on the camel to be with Isaac, she must have said many times, "Isaac, I love you! Isaac, I want to see you and be with you!" It is the same with us today. As we are traveling on our long journey, we say over and over again, "Jesus, I love You. Jesus, I long to meet You and be in Your presence."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_368.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_370.html">Next</a> </body></html>
