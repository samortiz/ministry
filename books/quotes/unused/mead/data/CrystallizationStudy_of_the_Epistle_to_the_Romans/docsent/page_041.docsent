   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE TRANSFER IN REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are regenerated in Christ in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 ; in this rebirth the divine transfer takes place and transfers us out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through regeneration God transferred us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we were in Adam, but today we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN CHRIST A. Chosen to Be Holy and</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Predestinated unto Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were chosen by God the Father to be holy to partake of His holy nature and predestinated unto sonship to possess His divine life Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We participate in the holy nature of God and the divine life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to realize that our position is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are in Adam, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are in Christ, we have God s nature and possess God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Judicially Redeemed, Forgiven, Justified,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Reconciled to God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are judicially redeemed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God Eph 1:7; Rom 3:24; 5:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of this took place according to God s righteous, legal requirements, so it is judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Organically Regenerated</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are organically regenerated to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, for the constitution of the church, the Body of Christ 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:14, 29; Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are the sons of God and the brothers of Christ for an organism to satisfy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This organism is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Sanctified by the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are sanctified by the Spirit of life with the element of the divine nature Rom 15:16 , renewed from the oldness of our old man by the Spirit of life Rom 12:2b; Titus 3:5 , transformed by the Lord Spirit with the life element of Christ Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 3:18 , conformed through transformation in life to the image of the firstborn Son of God, making us the many God-men, the mass reproduction of Christ the God-man, the prototype Rom 8:29 , and glorified to be completely redeemed in our body, the framework of our entire being, for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship Rom 8:30, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have received the divine nature, but the divine nature has to work within us by the Spirit of life to sanctify us into God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being holy is connected to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not have the divine nature of God, we can never be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s divine nature is the element of sanctification, and this element is wrought into our being by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then gradually we become holy as God is in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, we become God in His nature and in His life, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the steps which accomplish the very great career on this earth of making man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. Delivered out of the Evil Kingdom of Satan</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are delivered out of the evil kingdom of Satan, that is, the authority of darkness Col 1:13a , freed from the warring, subduing, and killing power of sin Rom 6:7; 7:11, 17-23 , freed from the yoke of slavery of the law Gal 5:1 , and freed from the vanity of the old creation and the slavery of corruption Rom 8:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are fighting with sin, so there is a war going on, raging all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sin is warring against us, subduing us, and killing us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Christ, we are freed from this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are also freed from the yoke of slavery of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law decreed by God through Moses enslaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only in Christ can we be freed from that slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are freed from the vanity of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is Paul s expression in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The old creation is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, the entire old creation will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why Solomon said that everything under the sun on this earth is vanity of vanities Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever we have is a part of the world, the world is the old creation, and the old creation is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in Christ we have been freed from this vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we are no longer in vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The world, the old creation, is vanity, and Christ is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are also freed in Christ from the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything in the world is under corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every new thing eventually decays.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That is the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To become old is a part of the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>F. Made a Royal Priesthood and a Holy Nation</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are made a royal priesthood and a holy nation Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9 , the overcomers over Satan Rev 12:11 , the overcomers over the world 1 John 5:5 , more than conquerors over the environmental troubles Rom 8:35-39 , and the kings to reign in the eternal life forever Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is all in Christ.</S>
