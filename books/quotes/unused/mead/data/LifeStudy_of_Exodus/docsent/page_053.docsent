   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GOD S WORD OF ASSURANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last message we covered two of the positive aspects of God s further training: God s name and God s covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, in this message we begin with God s word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. To Deliver the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>out of the Egyptian Bondage</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God assured Moses that the children of Israel would be delivered out of the Egyptian bondage 6:1, 6-7; 7:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was a word of assurance, which is different from a word of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God was assuring Moses, it seems He was saying, Moses, forget the people s unbelief, forget Pharaoh, and forget the condition of your lips.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But be impressed with My word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am Jehovah, and I remember the covenant which I have established.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to My covenant, I will surely deliver the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses, believe this word of assurance and care for it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I assure you My chosen people will be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. To Take the Children of Israel to Him</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>for a People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 6:7 the Lord said, I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here God assured Moses that He would take the children of Israel to Him for a people and that He would be a God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did not want Moses to tell Him how bad the people were or how they refused to hearken to his word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, He wanted Moses to believe and to declare that the children of Israel were the best people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord loved them; they were His special treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we had been Moses, we probably would have argued with the Lord about His people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We might have said, Lord, don t take them to You for a people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can testify from my experience that they are not good at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Probably I am the only one who is obedient to You.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how the people seemed in the eyes of Moses, God was assuring Moses that they were His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His eyes, they were excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. To Make Them Know</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That He Is Jehovah, Their God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 7 the Lord also said, And ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord would do whatever was necessary to cause the children of Israel to know that He was Jehovah, their God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To assure Moses of this, He repeated again and again the words, I am Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. To Make the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His Armies</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, the Lord assured Moses that He would make the children of Israel His armies 6:26; 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that He would use them to fight the battle for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a word of assurance this was!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>E. To Bring the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>into the Promised Land</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, in 6:8 the Lord said, I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did lift up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a possession: I am Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord did not want to hear any complaint concerning His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He would take them to Him for a people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He would make them His armies, and He would bring them into the good land as He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was God s word of assurance to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Naturally speaking, what Moses said to the Lord regarding the children of Israel and regarding Pharaoh was true.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But God did not believe the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, He believed in Himself, in His covenant, and in His word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He also believed in what His mighty hand was able to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, God did make the children of Israel His armies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Look at what happened at the conquest of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the children of Israel were marching around that city, the angels in heaven must have been rejoicing to see the army God had gained for the defeat of His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because God believed in what He was able to do, He paid no attention to the outward situation concerning the unbelief of His people and the stubbornness of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s word of assurance to Moses should be an encouragement to us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some say that it is impossible to have the recovery of the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if the recovery of the church life is not possible, then the Lord Jesus has no way to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the sake of His coming back, He needs the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the church built up according to the Lord s desire can be the stepping stone into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we believe that it is altogether possible to have the recovery of the proper church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have the Lord s promise and His word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be reminded that the Lord s recovery did not originate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What we are doing in the recovery today is not according to our plan; it is according to the Lord s covenant and His word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus said that He would build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is taking place today, not according to our plan, but according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not believe the environment or the circumstances believe God s word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are sent by the Lord to a particular place for the church life, do not believe the negative things in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, hearken to the Lord and pay attention to His word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all need training in these matters.</S>
