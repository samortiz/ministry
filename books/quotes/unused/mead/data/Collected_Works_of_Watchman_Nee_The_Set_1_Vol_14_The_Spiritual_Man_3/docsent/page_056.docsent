   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must understand our union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God does not regard any individual believer as a separate believer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God put all believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No believer can be outside of Christ, because his daily life is supplied by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God's eyes the union of the believers to Christ is an absolutely true fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The body of Christ is not a spiritual term, but a real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as the head is joined to the body, Christ is joined to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the eyes of God, our union with Christ is complete, eternal, and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words our spirit is joined to Christ's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our soul is joined to the soul of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a union in mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our body is also joined to the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the union between us and Christ is without any breach, our body cannot be an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are members of Christ, our body must also be Christ's member.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, this will only be consummated at the time of the coming resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today, through our union with Christ, this has become a fact already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This teaching is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can gain much consolation if we know that the body of Christ is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every truth can be experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have we found some physiological defect in our body, such as illness, affliction, or weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to see that the body of Christ is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our body is joined to His body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we are able to draw life and power from the Lord Jesus to supply all the needs of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whoever has a deficiency in his body ought to exercise his faith to stand firmly on the position of his union with the Lord and acknowledge that he is for the Lord and the Lord is for him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, he can apply all that the Lord is for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostle was amazed that the Corinthian believers could not comprehend such an obvious teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He reckoned that if the believers knew this teaching, they would not only have plenty of spiritual experiences, but they would also receive a warning concerning their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the body is a member of Christ, how could they join themselves to a prostitute?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 6:16 says, "Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For He says, The two shall be one flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the apostle explained clearly the principle of union.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whoever is joined to a prostitute is one flesh with the prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, he becomes a member of the prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The believer who is joined to Christ is a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we take the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute, making them also members of a prostitute, where will Christ stand then?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why the apostle said, "God forbid" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In these three verses we can see the mystery of the union of our body with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The most crucial point in these three verses is the matter of union.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 17 means that since those who join their body to a prostitute become one flesh with her and become her members, the believers who are joined to the Lord in one spirit will all the more have their body become His members!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a very crucial thought.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the mere joining of one's body with a prostitute makes two bodies one, will not those whose whole being is joined to Christ be one with Him in the body?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle believes that one who is joined to the Lord is initially "one spirit" with the Lord because this is the union of spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But he never considered the body of a believer to be independent of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He admits that the initial joining is in the spirit, but the union of the spirit also makes the believer's body become a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This statement is a proof of what he just said, that "the body is...for the Lord" and "the Lord is also for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the problems rest on the matter of union.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's children must know clearly that their own position in Christ is an uninterrupted union.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, our body is a member of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The life of the Lord can be manifested from our body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord were weak, anguished, and sick, we would have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But since He is not, our union with Him can secure the health, power, and life of the Lord for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we must stress one point: this does not mean that since our body is a member of Christ, our body should sense all the spiritual fellowship and spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christians are often misled to think that since the body is a member of Christ, everything should be evidenced by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They think that God's presence should be felt in the body, that God shakes the body, and that the shaking of God is in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think that God rules over the body directly, that the Holy Spirit fills the body, and that the Holy Spirit communicates His will to the body, using the tongue and mouth of the body to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, the body replaces the spirit in its work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result the spirit loses its function, and the body works for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes the body cannot endure much labor and breaks down.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, evil spirits, that is, spirits without a body, love nothing more than man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their main purpose is to attach themselves to man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a believer exalts the position of his body beyond what it should be, evil spirits will take the opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is in accordance with the law of the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a believer thinks that God and His Spirit communicate with him through his body, he may expect God and His Spirit to communicate with him through his body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God and His Spirit do not communicate directly through his body but through his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the believer still insists on pursuing after the experience of God in his body, evil spirits will take this opportunity to come into him because this is exactly what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The result is nothing other than evil spirits attaching themselves to the believer's body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we speak about the union of our body with Christ, we are simply saying that the body can receive God's life and be strengthened by it, and that one should use it carefully because its position is so noble.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not saying that the body can take over the work of the spirit.</S>
