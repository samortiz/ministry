Verses 13 through 17 are a footnote to verse 12; verse 18 should follow immediately after verse 12. Verses 13 through 17 therefore are parenthetical, that is, an insertion, not the main text. Let us begin from verse 12.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned.&#8221; Adam was a channel through which sin flowed into the world, and death followed behind sin. So death passed not only to one man but to all men because all have sinned. Yet after Paul finished this verse, he feared that some might raise the question: &#8220;Since there was no law during Adam&#8217;s time, where did sin come from? And if there were no sin, how could there be death?&#8221; Paul, therefore, put in a parenthetical explanation, verses 13 to 17, which may be subdivided into three sections.<p>Verses 13 through 14 say, &#8220;For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one&#8217;s account when there is no law. But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam&#8217;s transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come.&#8221; Paul meant that before there was the law, sin was not counted as sin. This does not mean that because there was no law, sin did not exist. Paul was dealing with a fact. Even though there was no law, sin was in the world. Since death was in the world, sin must have been in the world also. Since death has come upon all, all have sinned. Although the sins committed by different men are different from Adam&#8217;s sin, the death is the same. Paul was proving one thing: even though the act was done by Adam alone, it affected the whole human race. Not only did Adam receive the consequence, but the whole human race received the same consequence also. The same is true with Christ, because Adam prefigured Christ; Christ&#8217;s actions affected the whole human race.<p>Verse 15 says, &#8220;But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many.&#8221; This verse compares the offense itself (or its nature) with grace; the offense is inferior to grace. Paul&#8217;s reasoning was that since Adam&#8217;s sin caused the many to die, could not the grace of God be gained more by the many? He was comparing the nature of the offense with the nature of grace. He was saying, &#8220;What kind of grace is the grace of God? The grace of God was given freely to men through one man, Jesus Christ. Could it not abound more to the many? Certainly it could abound more to the many.&#8221;<p>Verses 16 through 17 say, &#8220;And it is not that as through one who sinned, so also the free gift is; for the judgment was out of one offense unto condemnation, but the gracious gift is out of many offenses unto justification. For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&#8221; These two verses compare the end result (or the retribution) of the offense with the end result of grace. Concerning the end result, the offense is still inferior to grace. As a result of one man&#8217;s sin, God condemned his sin according to righteousness, and many were also condemned. Because of one offense, many were condemned. Yet grace can forgive so many offenses, not just one offense. Therefore, the end result of grace far surpasses the end result of the offense. If one offense could affect so many, it is not known how many would be condemned by ten offenses or a hundred offenses. However, God&#8217;s grace can forgive many offenses. The end result of grace is indescribably better. Verse 17 reinforces verse 16. Since we have both grace and righteousness, can we not reign in life? Surely we can.<p>Verse 18 says, &#8220;So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.&#8221; The thought in this verse immediately follows the thought in verse 12. Verse 12 says that just because one man, Adam, sinned, death came upon all men because all have sinned. Verse 18 continues by saying that through Adam&#8217;s one offense, all men were condemned, but through Christ&#8217;s one righteous act, which accomplished righteousness once for all on the cross, there was justification of life to all men. If a person does not believe this doctrine, he will not admit that he is a sinner. The Bible does not say that you become a sinner when you commit sin; the Bible says all men are sinners. As long as you are a human being, you are a sinner. You, therefore, are a sinner because Adam sinned. Many do not understand the salvation of Christ because they do not understand the things concerning Adam. If you can say that all men were condemned in Adam, why can you not say that in Christ all men were justified to receive life? Praise and thank God! What we have gained in Christ is much more than what we have lost in Adam. We are sinners because of Adam&#8217;s one offense, and we can be saved because of Christ&#8217;s one righteous act. Adam&#8217;s one offense brought forth such a result. Likewise, Christ&#8217;s one righteous act brought forth a far better result.<p>Verse 19 says, &#8220;For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous.&#8221; This verse explains that this result is much better than the other because this Man is far better than the other man. Putting it in another way, the other act was inferior to this act because the former man was inferior to the latter Man. For example, if both Brother Lee and Brother Chang are sweeping the floor, you can conclude that Brother Chang does not do as well as Brother Lee because Brother Chang himself is inferior to Brother Lee. Verse 18 says that what Adam once did is far inferior to what Christ has done. Verse 19 tells us that the reason the act of Adam was not as good as the act of Christ is that Adam was inferior to Christ. Adam disobeyed, but Christ obeyed. Because of Adam&#8217;s disobedience, all men were made sinners. In the same manner, because of Christ&#8217;s obedience, all men were made righteous.<p>Verse 20 says, &#8220;And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has superabounded.&#8221; The law does not cause the offense to abound; it only exposes the many offenses. The law does not cause man to sin; it only reveals man&#8217;s sins. This is like a mirror; it only exposes the flaws on my face but cannot increase them. The law is from without, and it shows us what great sinners we are. After we come to know ourselves, God shows us that His grace abounds much more than sin.<p>Verse 21 says, &#8220;In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; Adam has passed away. Now there is only the gospel. Praise and thank God that we are saved, but not through ourselves.
