   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 2 NO TEACHING CONCERNING ETERNAL DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last message we read Ezekiel 18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here let me add a few additional words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who study the Old Testament carefully and who understand the Old Testament know that it does not have the teaching of eternal death, nor does it have anything like eternal punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the deaths mentioned in the Old Testament refer to the death of the body, and the only place that people go after they die is Hades, and not hell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two or three places seem to speak of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But they are either wrong translations or should be interpreted otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the deaths mentioned in the Old Testament are the death in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are not eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament was written to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because they were earthly men, their failures were also earthly failures, and their punishments, earthly punishments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am not saying that there is no such thing as eternal death in the Old Testament; there is such a thing in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Old Testament never teaches us about eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Old Testament, those that were blessed by God had much cattle, sheep, gold, and silver bestowed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These were the signs of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the New Testament, those who are blessed by God can say, "Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene...walk!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament, there were the gold and the silver.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Testament, there is no silver or gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Old Testament, though not exclusively dealing with things in the flesh, mainly speaks of the physical and material aspect of things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament, when a man was blessed by God, he would enjoy long life, have many offspring, and have much wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These are the blessings of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the New Testament, we do not see these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, we see that James died.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Stephen died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many were martyred for the sake of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were not at all cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, the New Testament never made offspring an item of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, those who live for the Lord should remain virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, what the Old Testament shows us and what the New Testament shows us are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that in the Old Testament there is no such thing as eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this is not taught as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because man does not understand this truth, the New Testament tells us about eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament are a few places that seem to speak of eternal death, but are wrong translations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One of them is translated as the wicked being turned into hell Psa 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But actually it should be translated as the wicked going to Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is temporary, and it is not for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Isaiah 66:24 it mentions worms which shall not die and the fire which will not be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems that this is speaking of the same thing that the Gospel of Mark speaks of Mark 9:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But please remember that Isaiah was not saying that unless the Israelites repented they would go down to hell, where the worm will not die and the fire will not be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Isaiah was prophesying concerning a group of people who will go to hell at the end of the millennium, where the worm will not die and the fire will not be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isaiah was not speaking of eternal death at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we drag him into the subject of eternal death, we are trying to import something foreign.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This would become an imported item.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>CHRIST OF NONE EFFECT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>BEING DIFFERENT FROM SEPARATION FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One thing more we have to know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the original language the word "brought to nought" is katargeo.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a passive verb.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a little of the sense of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Kata has somewhat the sense of detachment, but the sense is not very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word katargeo means to be led away from the effect and the function.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Stephan's lexicon of Greek words can be considered as one of the best.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It tells us that the word here means to be led away from the function.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One must see the difference between separation from Christ and being led away from the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a man has left Christ and is separated from Him, then everything is through.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But this is not what Paul was saying here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul said that if they keep the law, they have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they want to hold on to the law, they have to let go of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If they follow the law, they will lose the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the effect of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the effect of Christ is manifested in me, I can rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Though I may be weak and worthless, I know that His grace is sufficient for me, and my heart is able to be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This joy and peace that I have in my heart is the effect of Christ on me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is Christ working out His effect on me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not try to be saved by my works.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I know that I am saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not have to strive to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not have to plead desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nor do I have to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I can rest in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today many Christians have turned away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ does not have much effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose I owe someone a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I cannot repay it even if I were to sell all that I have.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now I have a best friend.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He says that since I am so heavily in debt, he will write a check for me so that I can clear my debts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But I am a lazy man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am too lazy to cash the check.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now do I have money at home?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do, but I also have a debt at home.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I have the check, but the check has no effect on me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The debt is still there; it has not been repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am still bearing the burden of the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today God has given us the check already.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But we have not cashed in on the effect of this check.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hence, to be separated from Christ and to have Christ made of none effect on us are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To be separated from Christ is to be not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But we can never be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Romans 8 tells us that there is no way for us to be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It says that no one can separate us from the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The grace we receive from Christ and the blessing we have from God are ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No one can overturn them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They cannot be overturned, because they are based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Through the many things that Christ has accomplished for us, the problem of eternal life and death is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is no way to overturn this, for this is based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But on the subjective side, the absence of peace in the heart and the continual presence of unhappiness is a Christian problem.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A man may worry about how he can receive grace and how he can preserve his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Every day his heart is held in suspense, not knowing what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When a man has turned away from the effect of Christ, he will not receive the effect he should receive from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hence, Galatians 5:4 shows us that for a man to pursue after law is for him to fall from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When he falls from grace, he is away from the effect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Therefore, this does not refer to man's losing his salvation after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Rather, it refers to one's not having the joy and peace of salvation.</S>
