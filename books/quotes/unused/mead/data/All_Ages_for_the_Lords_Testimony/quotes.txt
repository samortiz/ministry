[1]  CONTENT Going On With the Lord According to Our Age for the Building Up of the Church The Young People Fighting the Battle, the New Ones Keeping the Tabernacle, and the Older Ones Caring Directly for the Tent of Meeting Maintaining the Testimony of the Oneness of the Church in Christ Shepherding the Saints The Tempering of the Body and Caring for the Saints
[2]  CHAPTER ONE GOING ON WITH THE LORD ACCORDING TO OUR AGE FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH
[3]  For some time many have been influenced by the concept that the church life depends mainly on the young people.
[4]  Those who are under thirty may think that the Lord's recovery is their kingdom, and the ones over thirty may feel that they are useless and out of date.
[5]  In the Old Testament those under the age of thirty were not qualified to minister in or around the tabernacle, which was a type of the church today as the Lord's testimony.
[6]  Instead of being useless, those who are thirty and over are the ones most useful in caring for the tabernacle, for the church as the Lord's testimony.
[7]  Numbers 4:3 says, "From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the military service, to do the work in the tent of meeting" Heb .
[8]  Hence, those between the ages of twenty and thirty were the fighting ones, and those between the ages of thirty and fifty were the ones to maintain and carry the tabernacle.
[9]  Among us there have been a number of brothers who were seeking eldership because of ambition.
[10]  Although this illustration is not adequate, it may help us to see that in the church life we should not expect to be an elder or a leader.
[11]  For this number we do not need very many elders, but we do need more brothers and sisters to take care of the young ones and of so many practical matters.
[12]  Whenever a matter pertaining to the service is put in your hand, do not organize anything.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO THE YOUNG PEOPLE FIGHTING THE BATTLE, THE NEW ONES KEEPING THE TABERNACLE, AND THE OLDER ONES CARING DIRECTLY FOR THE TENT OF MEETING
[14]  We have seen that in the Lord's move on earth, there are two areas of function: fighting the battle and keeping the testimony.
[15]  For fighting the battle the Israelites between the ages of twenty and thirty were useful, but for keeping the testimony the older ones, those above the age of thirty, were necessary.
[16]  Numbers 3:32 says, "And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary."
[17]  For this reason, we have some evenings each week for the basic church meetings, meetings for prayer, the Lord's table, and Bible study; one evening for our family life; and the other evenings open to have fellowship with saints, especially to care for the new ones or for the young ones.
[18]  In the past the elders have been too exercised in making arrangements and in selecting saints to do things.
[19]  Instead of this, we should give the saints the liberty to carry out their burden and encourage them to do so.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE MAINTAINING THE TESTIMONY OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH IN CHRIST
[21]  The Lord's recovery is not primarily a matter of doctrine.
[22]  In the recovery today we are concerned for the experience of Christ and for the practice of the proper church life.
[23]  As those in the Lord's recovery, our spirit and our motive must be pure, and we must do everything possible to avoid division.
[24]  The saints should respect the elders as the leading ones in the church and have fellowship with them.
[25]  In activities we may be different, but in our speaking of Christ and the church we are one, not because the elders endeavor to make us one, but because we are for the testimony of the oneness of the church in Christ.
[26]  We have seen that in the church life there is the need not only for elders, but also for prophets, teachers, and exhorters.
[27]  Brothers who love the Lord and have the ability to do something for the church have the subconscious desire to be elders.
[28]  In the church life we need to take care of the little ones, the weaker ones, and the uncomely ones.
[29]  We must not have any rank; the strong ones should not form into a special class of their own.
[30]  In order to shepherd the saints, the elders must be apt to teach.
[31]  In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul speaks of those who take the lead well.
[32]  In the church life there is some need for administration, for example, to make decisions concerning the times and days of the meetings and for other practical arrangements.
[33]  Because we love Christ and the church, we should take Christ as our practical life and the church life as our practical living.
[34]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY AND CARING FOR THE SAINTS
[35]  In this message we shall consider some verses in 1 Corinthians 12.
[36]  We may think that the stronger ones are needed but that the weaker ones are burdensome.
[37]  In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, "Our comely members have no need."
[38]  Sooner or later in the church life, you will meet some brothers and sisters who have little souls.
[39]  If there were not this kind of person in the church, the Bible would not speak of consoling or comforting the little-souled ones.
