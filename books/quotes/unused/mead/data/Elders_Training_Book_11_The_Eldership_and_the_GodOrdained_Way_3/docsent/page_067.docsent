   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the recovery we have been suffering and suffering from 1922 up to now because of these three things: the pride of the younger ones, the thought of being a hero of the middle-aged ones, and the opinions of the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everything may be all right with us now, but these problems are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of us need to be warned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are younger ones, we should be warned of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are in middle age, we should learn to be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not wear a "mask" in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are older, we should remember that the problem with older people is opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are a number of brothers working with me to carry out the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes, although I have had the proper way to go on, I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the brothers helping me expressed a way which was quite different from my way, I would not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The frustration of opinions can be illustrated by five brothers taking one car to go to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first decision they have to make is who the driver will be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they have not been dealt with by the cross, this decision could take much time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once this is decided upon, the driver may ask what way he should take.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The opinions expressed concerning what way to take can also take much time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This waste of time hinders, frustrates, and delays them from arriving at their destination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we should be exercised not to express any opinion if we are not the "driver."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My point is this if the elders in the eldership are not one, sooner or later, they will "kill" themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This has been the situation among us in a number of places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the three problems of pride, thinking that one is a hero, and opinions are all there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When these problems are present in the eldership, the eldership is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would like to ask the elders if they are in oneness in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who think they are a hero may wear a mask, feeling that they can convince everyone and subdue everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is the case, can the church in this locality be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is torn down by these kinds of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers, you need to realize that to be a person in the eldership in the Lord's recovery is a serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are young, beware of your pride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are in middle age, beware of your thinking that you are the hero, the strong one among the others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are an older one, beware of your opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the eldership there should be no pride, no thought of being a hero, and no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There should be only truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not want to know anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past two years of the full-time training in Anaheim, I can testify that I and all the trainers did not have anything other than the truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the blessing has been here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we practice the one accord, our name will be Iddo, Berechiah, and Zechariah Zech 1:1 , meaning that at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and Jehovah remembers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In some localities there is no blessing because some of the brothers wear a mask.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are not honest, sincere, and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you think that the Lord will bless you and remember you if you are like this?</S>
