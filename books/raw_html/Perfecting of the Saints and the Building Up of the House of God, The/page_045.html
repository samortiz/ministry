	 <h2 class="head2">Having Faith</h2>
<p>It is not easy for a person with a small heart to have faith. It is rare for a small-hearted person to have genuine faith. Anyone who has faith has a large heart. From God&rsquo;s point of view, our faith is as small as a mustard seed (Luke 17:6). However, every matter related to faith is immeasurably great. The mustard seed is small, but the issue of such a small seed is immeasurable. A small amount of faith can produce a great result. Our faith depends on our heart. If our heart is large, we will spontaneously have faith.</p>
<p>We may speak of faith as being large or small, but a small-hearted person does not have faith. Only a large-hearted person has faith. If our heart is large, we do not need to plan how to take care of our living or how to pay for our expenses. A large-hearted person does not worry about such minor items. This is the kind of help that we receive from reading the biography of spiritual persons. Hudson Taylor and others who were used by God did not have banks or committees to support their work. This is a reason that we should learn to have a large heart. Once our heart is enlarged, it will be easy for us to have faith. The larger our heart is, the more faith we will have. Our faith will be so immeasurable that we will believe that God can do extraordinary things. However, no one can encourage or force us to have such faith. Having faith that trusts in God depends on our heart being enlarged.</p>
<p>The population of the world has increased over the years. Even though the rate of increase is constantly accelerating, people today do not necessarily live in a poorer condition than people in the ancient days. The larger a population is, the greater the financial pressure, but it seems that people are even wealthier. For example, the population of Taiwan is ten million, and it increases yearly by three hundred thousand people, which is the population of the city of Kaohsiung. This poses a problem to the government in Taiwan, because in ten years the population increase will be ten times the population of Kaohsiung. Moreover, the population increase is exponential; more people beget more children. Thus, in ten years there may be a yearly increase of four hundred thousand. We should not worry about how these people will live. Taiwan will probably be more prosperous by then. All the numbers are in God&rsquo;s hand. God allows people to be poor or rich. Whether a person is poor or rich is in God&rsquo;s hand. No one can control this.</p>
<p>We should never consider how poor the saints are or how impoverished the place is where we labor. Once we consider these matters, we have no way to go on. Even when we are financially pressed on every side with no way out, our help comes from God. This is beyond our expectation. Hence, we need living faith. A mustard seed may be small in size, but because it is living, it can produce great results.</p>
<p>Living faith depends on a heart that is enlarged. A believer who is specialized does not have much potential before the Lord. No matter how much he endeavors to learn, he will not be useful to the Lord. His primary need is to allow God to enlarge his heart. Once the heart is enlarged, it is easy to have living faith. A worker should believe in God&rsquo;s grace and mercy and not in his planning or imagination. What God measures out to us is not according to our expectation, and it is beyond our calculations. If we allow God to work in us and enlarge our heart, it will be easy for us to have faith that grows and is living. Instead of being influenced by the environment, we will receive God&rsquo;s mercy to see that all things in the universe are in His hand for the accomplishment of His work. The Lord&rsquo;s special mercy and blessing exceed our faith.</p>
<p>If we would work for the Lord and be useful in His hand, we must have living faith. We should learn to receive a burden from the Lord; that is, to receive His commission. We cannot receive a burden if we have a small heart, do not have faith, and only walk by sight. Even if God gives us a vision and a burden, we will not receive it if our heart is small. If we have a small heart and no faith, the vision with the burden that comes from the Lord will simply vanish like a fleeting cloud. It is not that God does not give us a vision but that we do not receive it, because our heart is small and we lack faith. God&rsquo;s vision and burden are great, but if our heart is too small to receive them, our usefulness will be limited.</p>
<p>God gives faith and enlarges our heart. When our heart is large, it is easy to have living faith. Living faith enables us to receive God&rsquo;s commission, God&rsquo;s burden. This has everything to do with our function and our usefulness. Billy Graham was raised up by the Lord less than ten years ago and is not yet forty years old. The reason he is able to carry out his work is that he has a large heart. He is young, competent, and steady, not proud or arrogant. His large heart gives him a living faith that enables him to receive the burden of the gospel. The burden he received is from God.</p>
<p>Some orthodox Christians in America are unreasonable in opposing Billy Graham. Without the proper view from God, a doctrine may be dead. God asked the prophets to do things that seemed unreasonable. For example, He asked the prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute (Hosea 1:2). Hosea could only follow this command, even though he would be criticized. Some believers are opposed to Billy Graham and his crusades because even people from heretical groups attend the crusades. Billy Graham, however, cares only that people hear the gospel. He does not care who hears the gospel. He would preach the gospel even if the devil attended a crusade.</p>
<p>This shows that Billy Graham has an enlarged heart. He stands with God and preaches the word to whoever attends. He does not try to please people. He has living faith and receives his burden from God. The Spirit affirms his labor with a strong result and supplies him. This does not mean, however, that we should imitate him. In principle, we should receive help from others, but we are accountable to God for our work.</p>
