<h2 class=head2>8. In Resurrection</h2><p>In eternity the believers will be altogether in resurrection. Nothing about them will be natural. The nations outside the city, on the contrary, will still be natural and will remain in the natural life. But the believers, the constituents of the holy city, will be absolutely in resurrection.<p>Revelation 21:17 indicates that the New Jerusalem will be in resurrection. This verse says, “He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel.” It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels (Matt. 22:30). Man’s being like an angel indicates the principle of resurrection. Hence, “a measure of a man, that is, of an angel” signifies that the city is not natural but in resurrection. In eternity nothing will be left of our natural life, for we shall be fully in resurrection. The entire city, therefore, will be in resurrection. Christ the Head and we His members will all be in resurrection.<h2 class=head2>9. As the Mingling of Divinity with Humanity</h2><p>Finally, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the divine Trinity will be the mingling of divinity with humanity. The New Jerusalem is a marvelous mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, built, and glorified tripartite people for His glorious and utmost expression in His consummated manifestation for eternity in the new creation of resurrection. This mingling is the eternal dwelling of God, signified by the number twelve (Rev. 21:12-13, 21a, 14, 17a). Twelve is composed of three multiplied by four. We know this by the fact that the New Jerusalem is a square with four sides. On each side are three gates (21:13). For eternity the New Jerusalem will be an absolute mingling, not simply an addition. It is a multiplication— the Triune God (three) multiplied by man (four).<p>In the New Jerusalem the number twelve is used fourteen times. Twelve foundations of twelve precious stones bear the names of the twelve apostles (21:14, 19-20). Twelve gates of twelve pearls with twelve angels bear the names of the twelve tribes (21:12, 21a). The city’s measurement is twelve thousand stadia in three dimensions (21:16). The height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (21:17a), which is twelve multiplied by twelve cubits. The tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each of the twelve months yearly (22:2). The number twelve appearing so many times, indicates that the holy city is a mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man.
