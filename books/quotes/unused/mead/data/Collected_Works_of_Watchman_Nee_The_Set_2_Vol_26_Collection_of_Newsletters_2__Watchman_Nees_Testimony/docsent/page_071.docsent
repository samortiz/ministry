   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After being saved, I continued on in school, though I had little interest in books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Others read novels in class, but I diligently studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Editor's note: Although Brother Nee studied the Bible in class, he still came first in the end-of-term examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, desiring to pursue spiritual things further, I left school and entered Dora Yu's Bible Institute in Shanghai Editor's note: a famous lady evangelist .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, before long she politely dismissed me, and I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason she gave for her action was that it was inconvenient for me to stay there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I realized that my flesh had not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was still fond of good food and fine clothing, and I enjoyed sleeping until eight o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Dora Yu felt I was good material for the Lord's interest and had good prospects, but when she discovered my laziness, she sent me home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time I was thoroughly disappointed and felt my future was doomed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time I even questioned my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But surely I was saved!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I even considered that I was quite good and that I had been transformed in many ways, not realizing that there was much yet to be learned and much to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Confident that the Lord had saved me and called me, I could not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I admitted that I was not yet good enough, but I felt that with the passing of more time I would improve.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the time was not ripe for me to continue my spiritual pursuits, I decided to return to school.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When my schoolmates saw me, they recognized that I had changed, but I had not changed thoroughly, for I still occasionally lost my temper and did some things wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There were times when I seemed very much like a saved person, but at other times I seemed very much like an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, my testimony in the school was not very powerful, and when I witnessed to Brother Weigh, he paid no heed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Editor's note: Brother Nee's prayers and guidance finally brought Brother Weigh to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After I was saved, I spontaneously loved the souls of sinners and hoped that they would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To this end, I began to preach the gospel and to bear testimony among my schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After nearly a year's work, however, no one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I thought the more words I could speak and the more reasons I could present, the more effective I would be in saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But though I had much to speak concerning the Lord, my words lacked power to move the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Prayer for Others' Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>About this time I met a Western missionary, Miss Groves Margaret Barber's co-worker , who asked me how many persons I had brought to the Lord in the year following my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I bowed my head, hoping to forestall further questioning, and shamefully admitted in a low voice that, although I had preached the gospel to my schoolmates, they did not like to listen, and when they did listen, they would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My attitude was that, since they would not heed the gospel, they would have to bear the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She spoke to me frankly, "You are unable to lead people to the Lord because there is something between God and you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may be some hidden sins not yet completely dealt with, or something for which you are indebted to someone."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I admitted that such things existed, and she asked if I were willing to settle them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I answered that I was willing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She also asked how I went about bearing testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I replied that I pulled people in at random and began to speak, regardless of whether they were listening or not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She said, "This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must speak to God first, before you speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You should pray to God, make a list of your schoolmates' names, and ask God which of them you should pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Pray for them daily, mentioning them by name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then when God affords the opportunity, you should bear testimony to them."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After that conversation, I immediately began to deal with my sins by making restitution, paying debts, being reconciled with my schoolmates, and confessing offenses to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I also entered in my notebook the names of about seventy schoolmates and began praying for them daily, mentioning their names individually before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes I prayed for them once every hour, praying silently, even in class.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When opportunity arose, I would bear testimony to them and try to persuade them to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My schoolmates often said jokingly, "Mr. Preacher is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us listen to his preaching."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fact was that they had no intention to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I called on Miss Groves again and said to her, "I have fully carried out your instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why is it not effective?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She replied, "Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Keep praying until some are saved."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the Lord's grace, I continued to pray daily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When opportunity arose, I bore testimony and preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank the Lord, after several months, all but one of the seventy persons whose names were in my notebook were saved.</S>
