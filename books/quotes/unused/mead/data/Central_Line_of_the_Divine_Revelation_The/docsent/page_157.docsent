   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the Believers' Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last of all, the Spirit gives life to our body Rom 8:11b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul calls our body a mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that our body is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we live, the closer we are to dying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we live to the end, we die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we all are dying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be dying, but we have the living One God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are dying, but He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As an elderly man, I have often asked the Lord how long He wants me to live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus far, I have not received an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But regardless of when I will die, I do have God, Christ, and the Spirit as the living factor within me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is our salvation, and He is the source of the dispensing that we enjoy every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This supplying Spirit within us is the dispensing One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His supplying is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He continually dispenses nothing less than God, Christ, and life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This dispensing brings the new element into us to replace our old element and to discharge the old element from us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This makes us not only a new man but a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By such a dispensing, we will be made altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>F. In the Believers' Mind</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The renewing of the believers by the Holy Spirit is mainly in the believer's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 12:2 says, "And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Renewing is for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The renewing begins from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The part of us that needs the most renewing is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind directs us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever we think, we do; whatever we think, we say; whatever we think, we express.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our mind is the director.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, God desires to touch our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before touching our mind, He touched our spirit, and we were regenerated; we were made alive in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But our mind remains a problem, so God continues to touch us in our mind in order to renew it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>G. In the Spirit of the Believers' Mind</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The renewing of the believers by the Holy Spirit is also in the spirit of the believers' mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day our mind will become the mind of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that, eventually, our spirit will get into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Romans 8:6 Paul said, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A proper Christian life is one in which we always turn our mind to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As human beings, we all have relatives spouses, children, parents, brothers, and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also have neighbors, friends, classmates, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have so many relationships, it is easy to get into trouble and to have friction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may not like some of our relatives, and our relatives may not love us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This causes trouble, and if we are living together, this trouble may cause us to remain in our mind throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our mind might be occupied with thoughts about others the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we think about others, the poorer they seem to be in our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you think about your spouse from morning until evening, you will surely quarrel with your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if you turn your mind to your spirit, after a few minutes you will say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before you turned to your spirit, you might have thought that everyone was wrong and that only you were right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after turning to your spirit, you consider that everyone is right and only you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must set our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we set our mind on the flesh, we experience death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Death comprises things such as hatred, darkness, emptiness, weakness, and dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these are elements of death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have no peace or to feel dark within is death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are indications that we have set our mind on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must check to see whether we have the feeling of death or the feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we sense life, then our mind is set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we sense death, our mind is set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our mind is on the flesh, we will suffer from hatred, dissatisfaction, and a number of other negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, we must turn our mind to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are absent from the spirit, we are absent from the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we set our mind on the spirit, our mind and spirit are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is like switching on electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once the electricity is switched on, the current flows.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same way, when our mind is set on the spirit, the dispensing of the divine element goes on continually.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we remain in our spirit with our mind set on such a spirit, we enjoy the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This renewing will not only keep us clean and purge us, but will also renew us to keep us from being old.</S>
