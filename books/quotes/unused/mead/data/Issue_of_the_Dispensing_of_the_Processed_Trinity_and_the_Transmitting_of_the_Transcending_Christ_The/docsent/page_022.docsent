   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Transforming the Believers into</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>a Treasure to God as His Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually, this sealing is for God's heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This sealing transforms the believers into a treasure to God as His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Father's dispensing we were all made sons of God, but in the dispensing of Christ, the Son, we, the many sons of God, have been made a treasure as God's heritage, as God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek verb translated "were designated" in Ephesians 1:11 means "to choose or assign by lot."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the clause "were designated as an inheritance" literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance for God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This inheritance was chosen through the transformation of the sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in the Son's dispensing all the sons of God become a treasure to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To Make the Believers a Mark of God's Image</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Spirit's dispensing He seals us, putting a mark upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This mark bears an image with a form.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God 2 Cor 3:18b; Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we are sealed, the more we look like God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the image we bear becomes not just an image, not just a mark, but an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the Spirit's sealing we express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SPIRIT'S DISPENSING IN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>HIS PLEDGING TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, this sealing becomes a pledging Eph 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more a piece of paper is sealed, the more the sealing ink will be on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, the more the Spirit seals us, the more the Spirit shares with us God's element.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This sealing element becomes a pledge to guarantee that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sealing declares that we are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, such a sealing becomes a pledge guaranteeing that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit's pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How good it is that we are God's inheritance and He is our inheritance!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although a brother may lose his job, he is still God's inheritance, and God is still his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under the Spirit's sealing and pledging, we do not need to worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter what may happen to us, we are still God's inheritance, and He is still our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because we are participating in the Spirit's sealing and pledging as His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit's sealing and pledging eventually make us God in His life and nature, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They also cause us to have the full assurance that we are God's and God is ours.</S>
