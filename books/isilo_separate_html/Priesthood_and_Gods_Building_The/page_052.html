<p>Some people think that revival comes from heaven, but this is not accurate. Real revival begins when we touch our spirit. Revival begins within us. If we touch our spirit when we come to the meeting, there will be an excellent revival. Revival is not a matter of asking God to send down fire from heaven but a matter of whether we are willing to light the fire within us. If we ask the Lord to revive the church but do not exercise to release our spirit, how can God revive the church?</p>
<p>If God cannot flow in us, we will not have much shining or sense of the Spirit within, and consequently, we will not have much transformation. Some saints have listened to messages for many years, but their disposition has not changed in any respect. Without a flow in their spirit, they have little sense of God, and they often are confused about spiritual matters. Saints in this condition cannot help others to pray and fellowship with the Lord in a fresh and living way. If, however, the water of life is flowing freely in us, we will bear new fruit regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THROUGH TO THE SPRING<br />
OF LIVING WATER IN US</h2>
<p>I have a heavy burden related to letting God flow in us. Today many of God&rsquo;s children are asking for His outpouring, but they are neglecting His flowing within them. The flowing out of God is His normal and eternal operation. Although the Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, it speaks even more of the Lord entering into us to become a fountain to flow out of us as rivers of living water (John 4:14; 7:37-39; Isa. 58:11). In Revelation 21 and 22, there is no mention of rain in the New Jerusalem, there is only a picture of living water that flows continuously. We need both the inner flowing and the outpouring of the Spirit, but the flowing of the inner spring is an eternal feature of the New Jerusalem. We are not opposed to the outpouring of the Spirit, but we do not promote the outpouring, based on negative situations in the past. The outpouring of the Spirit is like a rainstorm that comes upon us suddenly. Although there may be an abundance of rain, the land will eventually become dry again. The residual water from a rainstorm does not last very long.</p>
<p>In Shantung Province in China there is a spring of water that is renowned for its continuous flowing. Even during droughts, there is no shortage of water. Within Christians there also is such a spring of water. If we truly realized this, we would not desire to seek the outpouring of the Spirit so much; instead, we would dig within our being until a spring begins to flow. Some saints need the outpouring of the Spirit, but if they have only this outpouring without digging to touch the spring of living water within them, the outpouring will not be sufficient because it will not last for a long time. God&rsquo;s children need to know this secret.</p>
<p>Today God is in our spirit; He is the fountain of living water. He desires for us to contact Him regularly so that He may flow out of us. Hence, we need to open the way for God; we need to turn to our spirit, exercise our spirit, and allow our spirit to be released. Whether we are at home or in the office, we must exercise our spirit. We have listened to many messages, but now we need to be priests who come to the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace. We should not remain in our mind but turn to our spirit. We need to read the Bible, but we need to pray even more. We should exercise our spirit more by exercising our spirit to pray more. This is our greatest need today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO SING AND PRAY</h2>
<p>In our meetings we should lead the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit more. The prayer meeting should involve less speaking of messages and more praying and singing. We are short of priests who burn incense and who sing; that is, we are short of praying and singing, which strengthens our spirit. Not exercising our spirit in the meeting is like trying to drive a car without turning the key. Every time we come to a meeting, we must first use our &ldquo;key&rdquo; to start the &ldquo;engine.&rdquo; Singing and praying will kindle our spirits. If our spirit is weak when we sing a hymn, we must sing until our spirit rises up. The most important matter in the prayer meeting is to open our spirit and exercise our spirit. As long as the saints learn to turn to the spirit and pray from the spirit, we do not need to restrict the topics for prayer. We also do not need to consider and compose our prayers or be influenced by our environment. We should pray only according to our spirit.</p>
<p>The saints who can sing should help other saints to learn to sing. If our singing is not focused, the spirit of the hymns will not come forth. We should spend much time to learn how to sing hymns so that we can sing at any time and in any place. Singing hymns will cause the brothers and sisters to rise up, and it is not necessary to sing every stanza. For example, we can sing stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #250 repeatedly: &ldquo;Spring up, well, with water; / Dig Thou, Lord, completely; / Dig away all barriers / That Thy stream flow through me.&rdquo; When a couple goes home after singing this stanza, they will be able to sing it together at home. Then the husband may ask his wife, &ldquo;Are you springing up with water?&rdquo; and the wife may ask the husband, &ldquo;Are you digging within?&rdquo; This kind of singing and speaking to one another will stir up and release their spirits.</p>
<p>The saints are active in their thoughts but not exercised in their spirit. We must increase our exercise of the spirit, digging a well in our being until the living water flows. There is a spring of living water in us. This spring is full of grace, mercy, peace, and power. Because it is easy for this spring to be plugged up, we need to continuously dig so that the Holy Spirit can flow out. As priests, our service is to dig a well to reach this spring of living water so that living water can flow out from the throne of grace. In this spring of living water, there is life, light, mercy, and grace for our timely help; there is everything that we need.</p>
<p>We do not need to ask God to pour out the Holy Spirit upon us. Rather, we need to know the God who is indwelling us. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in the Son bodily (Col. 2:9), and the Son is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16). All the riches of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in our spirit; we only need to dig and let Him flow. In the meetings there is no need for a long message; rather, we should lead the saints to exercise their spirit by singing and praying. Furthermore, we should leave some time for the saints to pray at the end of the meeting so that they may realize the preciousness and the secret of prayer. We should pray in the meetings, and we should also pray at home and in other places. We must realize that we are New Testament priests. We should pray not only by ourselves but also corporately with other brothers and sisters.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
