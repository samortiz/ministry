   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Holding Them Back from Taking Off</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Their Filthy Garments</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zechariah 3:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the prodigal son came home, the father gave him the best robe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prodigal son could not wear the clothes of a pauper in his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The robe denotes righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The devil is afraid that man will take off his old righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why he always tries to set up another righteousness apart from the righteousness of God Rom 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus and cast off the righteousness of self-renouncing service which most moralists hold today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Then He showed me Joshua...and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him....Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments" Zech 3:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan dislikes for us to take off any "former" things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believers are saved through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, yet they are not willing to remove their "former" righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The clothes may be naturally filthy, yet they are still clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the righteousness one holds is filthy, it is still a kind of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan causes the believers to have a righteousness which is based upon their own strength, that is, to develop their natural righteousness, hoping that by so doing they will obtain God's favor and earn man's praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Little do they know that old garments are extremely filthy before God; our natural righteousness is unacceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan encourages us to execute the demands of the spirit by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should beware of this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Working in Fleshly Jealousy and Rivalry</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James 3:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan is not willing to see Christians become one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When two disciples come together, he will try to divide them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When three disciples come together, he will try to isolate them from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more linkages there are, the more he will try to break them into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will try to stir up jealousy and rivalry among the believers, causing them to become reluctant to work together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is true not only concerning physical things; even in spiritual work, he causes the believers to become jealous of and compete against each other: "You are more spiritual than I am."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Your preaching is more welcomed by others than mine is."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Your doctrinal views are different from mine."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this, jealousy and rivalry arise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This rivalry is bitter and comes from the heart of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Outwardly, it is not easy to detect, yet how very dangerous it is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keeping Them from the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>by Means of Other Men</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew 16:22-23</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!...But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matt 16:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The devil found his defeat on the cross; therefore, he is the most afraid of a man going to the cross and securing the victory of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here, Satan was so bold as to tempt the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He tried to make Him set His mind on the things of men rather than on the things of God v. 23 . The devil is good at using natural affection to turn man away from the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will cause man to think that this way is too hard, too difficult, and that for one to take it would be too harsh on the self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we set our mind on the things of men, we will not be able to set it on the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, whether through self-pity or a natural concern for others, we will inevitably cause God's will to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once a man becomes prosperous, it becomes easy for Satan to put his own things inside him; self-love, self-esteem, and self-pity are all contrary to the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To avoid something, to pity the self, to fear, and to compromise, are to Golgotha as north is to south.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan's way is to encourage man to hold on to the self and to cling to natural affections.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Satan is afraid that man will go to the cross to be crucified and then resurrected from the dead v. 21 . For this reason, he tries his best to prevent man from going to the cross, for apart from the cross, there is no other way ordained by the Lord 1 Thes 3:3 . Which way are you taking today? It is a pity that many Christians try to sidestep the cross whenever they see it and are unwilling to be crucified! Although they are spared from suffering, the ease and comfort which they gain cannot be compared with the will of God which they miss! If they actually die, they will actually resurrect, and Satan will have no ground to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what Satan hates the most.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since Satan is afraid of our dying on the cross and resurrecting from the dead, we should all the more die to our self through trusting in the Lord and then resurrect from the dead.</S>
