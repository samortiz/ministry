<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MYSTERIES OF GOD AND<br />
OF CHRIST&mdash;CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is also concerning the mysteries of God and of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32). The content of the New Testament, that is, our faith, is concerning the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ; the mystery of Christ is the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the great mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is in faith (Jude 3; 1 Tim. 1:3-4). If we were to take the apostles&rsquo; teaching out of the Bible, the New Testament would be empty. The Old Testament concerns the law of Moses, and the New Testament concerns the apostles&rsquo; teaching, that is, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in faith. Many Christians know that the Old Testament is concerning the law of Moses and that the New Testament is concerning the grace of Christ, but this is all they know. Very few know that the grace of Christ in the New Testament is God&rsquo;s economy. This economy is the Triune God who became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, became the life-giving Spirit, and enters into us to be our life and person, becoming one with us and making us part of the Body of Christ for His expression; the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ will be the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the processed Triune God working Himself into His redeemed people to be one with them. There was the age before the law and the age of the law; now we are in the age of grace, and in the future there will be the age of the kingdom. Passing through one age after another, God accomplishes everything; eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s economy, the New Jerusalem, will be manifested. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, that is, the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Although Luke was not an apostle, he wrote the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts under the direction of Paul. It can be said that Luke wrote for Paul based on all that Paul had conveyed to him. Mark was also not an apostle, but he was the spiritual son of Peter; Peter conveyed to Mark the things concerning the Lord Jesus, and Mark wrote accordingly. All the other writers, such as Matthew and John, were apostles. It is the apostles who completed the New Testament; hence, the content of the New Testament is the teaching of the apostles. Today our faith is the entire New Testament, which is the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The denominations in Christianity promote certain practices in the New Testament as their faith. For example, the Baptists promote the practice of baptism by immersion; hence, their faith is baptism instead of the entire New Testament. Presbyterians promote the governing of the church by the presbytery as an item in their creed. As a result, they do not have the entire New Testament as their faith; rather, they take a certain item in the New Testament as the primary element of their faith. This is the case also with Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Methodists. The Pentecostal movement promotes speaking in tongues. This is the condition of Christianity today. If someone asks us what our faith is, we should tell him, &ldquo;Our faith is the entire New Testament, that is, the teaching of the apostles.&rdquo; The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are the teaching of the apostles and speak primarily of the economy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY<br />
NOT RELYING ON A SINGLE PERSON</h2>
<p>For over a century, the matter of the New Testament ministry has been discussed, debated, disputed, and even attacked by Christians. Everyone is involved in discussions as to who should take the lead in the New Testament ministry. The Catholic Church says that Peter should take the lead, because Peter was the successor of the Lord Jesus. They also claim that the popes succeeded Peter. They claim that Peter was the first pope; thus, the pope should take the lead. Whenever those in the Catholic Church encounter a problem, their decision is not based upon the Bible but upon the papacy. Some may not say that it is according to the pope but according to the Vatican; nevertheless, because the Vatican refers to the pope, it is still the pope who takes the lead.</p>
<p>The Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther, recovered justification by faith and overthrew the headship of the pope. In the Lutheran Church, undoubtedly, Luther was considered to be the leader. The Baptist churches, on the other hand, are not led by any person but by the teaching of baptism. If a person is a preacher in the Baptist Church, whatever he teaches, speaks, and does must be according to baptism. If a preacher teaches, speaks, and does anything different from baptism, he will be rejected. As to the other denominations, some take an individual as their head, and others take their so-called faith as their head. In the Episcopalian Church, that is, the Anglican Church, the state church of England, the king or queen of England is the head.</p>
<p>According to the record of the New Testament, Peter took the lead at the beginning, but in Galatians 2:11-14, when Peter came to Antioch, Paul opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. Before some came from James, he continually ate with the Gentiles, but when they came, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy. When Paul saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, he said to Peter before them all, &ldquo;If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?&rdquo; After this incident, it seems impossible that Peter would be able to continue to preach Jesus among the people. Not long after this, Paul went up to Jerusalem to discuss the matter of circumcision with the apostles and elders. He knew deep within that Peter&rsquo;s fault was apparent; God had established Peter to take the lead, but he led the saints into hypocrisy. This example shows that Peter was not the &ldquo;pope&rdquo;; he was not the leader.</p>
<p>In the New Testament ministry, who is the &ldquo;pope&rdquo;? Who is taking the lead? The teaching of the apostles is taking the lead. When Peter was rebuked, it was not actually Paul who rebuked him; it was the teaching in the New Testament that rebuked him. If one does not act according to the standard of the truth of the gospel, such an action damages and violates the truth of the gospel. It was the truth of gospel, not Peter, that was taking the lead. The teaching of the apostles is the leadership in the New Testament ministry. We began to see this matter in 1986; earlier, we were not clear concerning this point. Through our experience in serving the churches for the past several decades and due to our research and study, that is, our comparing and checking with the New Testament, we have seen that the leadership in the New Testament ministry does not rely on a single person, not on Peter, Paul, or anyone else; rather, it relies on the teaching of the apostles. Only the teaching of the apostles counts.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Church, Peter is considered irreproachable. He is called the successor of Jesus Christ, the leader in the New Testament. However, this is not according to the facts. When Peter and Paul carried out their ministry, their ministry was led by the apostles&rsquo; teaching. As an illustration, a nation is actually led by its constitution, not by its president. The &ldquo;constitution,&rdquo; that is, the leadership in the New Testament, is the teaching of the apostles; we all need to follow this teaching.</p>
