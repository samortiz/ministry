<P>In this passage there are three main points which strongly prove that our Lord Jesus is God Himself:</P><P>1) He was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God Himself. Hence, because Jesus was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit, it means that He was God incarnated. The Holy Spirit went into Mary and Jesus the Son came out. Jesus' essence was God. This agrees exactly with John 1:1 and 14, which say that He is God who became flesh.</P><P>2) God ordained His name to be called Jesus. "Jesus" in Greek is equivalent to "Joshua" in Hebrew (Num. 13:16; Heb. 4:8), which means "Jehovah Savior." This tells us that this Jesus is Jehovah God who became our Savior. Hence, He is God Himself. In the Old Testament He was only Jehovah. But praise the Lord, through incarnation He became Jesus, Jehovah our Savior!</P><P>3) God not only ordained His name to be Jesus, but men also called Him by the name Emmanuel. Emmanuel means "God with us." This also indicates that He is God. The One who became flesh and dwelt among men is God with men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ Being the Son of God</H2><P>When Jesus was to be conceived, God sent the angel Gabriel who said, "He will be great, and will be called, Son of the Most High..the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God" (Luke 1:32, 35). Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is called the Son of God (Matt. 3:17; 14:33; 16:16; 27:54; John 1:34, 49). This title shows that the Lord is divine and that He is equal to God (John 5:17-18). Because of these points we should have no question that Christ was God incarnated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. AS MAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ Being Man</H2><P>The other side of the Lord's incarnation is that it occurred through Mary, a human virgin. This gave Jesus the human essence. He was one hundred percent man. He was God who had become a man. But He did not become a man suddenly. He stayed in a woman's womb like any other baby. Imagine that! God was confined in a woman's womb for nine months! Then He was born and brought up like any other Jewish child (Luke 2:21-24). Everything was done according to the ordinary human way, proving He had definitely become a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ Being the Son of Man</H2><P>Although He was the Son of God, many times Jesus called Himself "the Son of Man" (Matt. 8:20; 9:6; 26:64; John 1:51; 3:13; 6:27). Matthew 1 gives the genealogy (family tree) of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of Abraham and the Son of David (Matt. 1:1). Therefore, Jesus was a genuine man.</P>
