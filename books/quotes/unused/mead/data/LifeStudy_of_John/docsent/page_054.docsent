   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Inadequacy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Religion s Law-keeping</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The central point of this case, on the negative side, is to show the inadequacy of law-keeping in the typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Law-keeping was the main thing in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every Jew respects the law and believes in keeping it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews realize that, apart from keeping the law, they have no way to please God, to behave themselves, and to perfect themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Any typical Jew will tell you that, next to God, nothing is as great or as important as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is number one and the law is number two.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So, law-keeping is everything to that typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Good Things of the Typical Religion</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jewish religion includes at least seven items: the holy city Jerusalem, the holy temple, the holy feast, the holy Sabbath, the angels, Moses, and the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you add these seven items together, they equal Judaism, the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These items are excellent and wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you ask me what is in Judaism, I will tell you at least seven things: 1 the holy city, 2 the holy temple, 3 the feasts for enjoyment, 4 the Sabbath days of rest, 5 the visiting angels, 6 Moses, the law-giver, and 7 the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with these seven items of Judaism, there was also the means of healing, because there was the healing pool of water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The significance of this picture is that the means of healing are always with the typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Judaism is the typical religion which has something that can heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The pool in Jerusalem signifies that the means of healing are in that typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there is a requirement you must have strength in order to walk and act.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever a chance is given for you to receive the benefits of this religion, you must have the strength to be first and the ability to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This case is a sign, showing us that here is a typical religion with many good and holy items which can heal you, but it requires your strength to walk and act.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though you are second, you will not obtain the benefits of this good religion, because you are not first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Practice of the Law-keeping</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us now consider some aspects of the practice of law-keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sheepgate 5:2 signifies the entrance to the law-keeping religion s sheepfold 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The name of the pool, Bethesda, means house of mercy, signifying that the people who practiced law-keeping realized that they needed the mercy of God because they were impotent, weak, and wretched, as portrayed in Romans 7:7-24.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The porches, like a sheepfold, signify the law-keeping religion s shelter, and the number five denotes responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The angel who stirred up the water signifies the agent through which the law, which could not give life, was given Gal 3:19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the practice of the law-keeping trying to make people perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By considering these aspects, we can see the situation of law-keeping, which is the major thing in the typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Impossibility of the Law-keeping</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible for man to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as people cannot walk up to the heavens, neither can they keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8:3 says that it is impossible to keep the law, because the law is weak through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All flesh is too weak to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is clearly portrayed in the case of the impotent man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The impotent man had been sick for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was unable to move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was filled with expectation when he saw the waters stirring, but it was impossible for him to get there in time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because he was impotent, unable to move, he could not receive healing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, due to our impotence, we cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The law is good, holy, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no problem with the law; the problem is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man is not only sick, but also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know from 5:25 that, in the eyes of the Lord, the impotent man was a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can a dead person walk?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he is to walk, he must first be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as you cannot make a dead person live, he can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Galatians 3:21 says that the law cannot give life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The law only makes demands upon people; it never supplies them with life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Due to the lack of life, man is absolutely unable to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are still religious, still trying to keep the law, let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you dead or alive?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You must admit that you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since you are a dead person, how can you keep the law?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A dead person can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because of the weakness of the flesh and because of the lack of life, it is impossible for man to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although there are an angel, the water, and the stirring of the water, there is no way for you to fulfill the requirement of getting to the water to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a clear picture showing us that the impotent and dead people find it impossible to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no hope for man with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>With respect to the law, we are helpless and hopeless cases.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today, we have an even better religion even the best religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But do you realize that the best religion requires you to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It requires you to walk, to act, and to be the first before you can obtain its benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Perhaps you have discovered that you are too weak to obtain what your religion has to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This indicates that you are where the impotent man was under the five porches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are like the impotent people under the law-keeping shelter.</S>
