<p>For the past two thousand years, Satan has done two kinds of work in regard to the organization of the church. On one hand, he replaces what is God-made with what is man-made, producing a well-ordered and hierarchical organization. The Roman Catholic Church today is the greatest hierarchical organization with the pope having nearly unlimited authority. When he gives a decree, all Catholics throughout the world need to obey. This is man-made. It is the same with today&rsquo;s Protestantism, which also has well-ordered, man-made hierarchical organizations. This is one aspect of Satan&rsquo;s work. The other aspect of Satan&rsquo;s work is to lead the believers to the opposite extreme, that is, away from well-ordered organization, whether man-made or God-made. Saints who claim to be delivered from the organization of Christianity may think that all believers are the same and are equal. This has some basis in the truth, but at the same time it is dangerous.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, when we were still young and had only recently been raised up by the Lord, we thought, due to the deep influence of Christianity, that all the saved ones were equal before God and that there was no need for any human arrangement or organization. In conducting our gospel meetings, we never arranged beforehand who would pray, who would speak, and who would be ushers. We made no arrangements at all. When the time arrived, everyone came together and sat in the meeting not knowing who was going to lead the singing, who was going to pray, and who was going to speak. We thought that all such arrangements belonged to man and that they were the product of human opinions and human organization; hence, we abandoned all these things. We forsook everything that was not clearly spoken of in the Bible. Hence, when we came together, we simply sat and waited for the leading and guiding of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot say that what we did then was wrong, but neither was it very prudent. Sometimes after we sat and waited for a while, we announced, &ldquo;Today none of us has the leading of the Holy Spirit, so the meeting ends here. Since the Holy Spirit has not moved, we also should not move.&rdquo; This was the case with our Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, prayer meeting, fellowship meeting, gospel meeting, and edification meeting. When we came together, we simply sat and waited for the leading of the Holy Spirit. Even though we cannot say that we were wrong, we were too extreme.</p>
<p>According to the truth we are children of God and are equal; nevertheless, based on the order arranged by God, there is still a distinction. First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;First apostles, second prophets, third teachers&rdquo;; this is to have an order. As children of God, we are all equal before God, but according to the order in the Body of Christ, we are not the same. For example, my head has the highest position in my body, and my feet occupy the lowest position in my body. They have entirely different positions. If my head and feet were in the same place, my body would be two-dimensional, not three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Every truth must be applied properly; otherwise, it can be taken to an extreme and become dangerous. While it is necessary to get rid of man-made hierarchal organizations, there is a need for a proper God-made and well-ordered placement to exist. We cannot deny that in the church God has an order of first, second, and third. Neither can we deny that the saints function as different parts of the Body. Some saints, in terms of their knowledge of God and what they have received from God and been entrusted with by God, are not that great; nevertheless, we cannot deny that each one has a particular function. The hands cannot say that the feet are not important and that every part should be a hand. Likewise, the feet cannot say that the hands are not important and that every part of the body should be a foot. The hands are the hands, and the feet are the feet. Each has its own function and functions accordingly.</p>
<p>The man-made organization within Catholicism and Protestantism surely offends God. I speak this word not as a criticism of others but as a warning to ourselves. However, if we think that all the saints are the same and are equal, this too is erroneous and unscriptural. Hence, we should not be intolerant when we hear the word <em>organization.</em> On one hand, the church is not an organization; on the other hand, the church is not completely without organization. God has placed some in the church in the position of first, second, third, and so forth. Some people may say that this order is only for explanation and that it is not an actual order. However, if this were the case, why did God not first speak of the interpretation of tongues and then of the apostles? The order in which they are presented is in fact an order. In the church the apostles are ranked first.</p>
<p>As an illustration, the New Testament always places apostles and prophets together, but it never says, &ldquo;Prophets and apostles.&rdquo; Rather, it always says, &ldquo;Apostles and prophets&rdquo; (Eph. 3:5; 4:11). This is the order in the Bible. Ephesians 2 says that we are &ldquo;being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets&rdquo; (v. 20). This proves that in the church there is a distinction of order according to God&rsquo;s placing. This placing, in human words, is organization. A placing is an arrangement, and since it is an arrangement, it cannot be separated from the term <em>organization.</em></p>
<p>It is a fact that the church has organization, but this fact should never be separated from life. The church is not merely an organization but an organism, an entity that has life within. We should not deny the fact that the church has organization, yet we should recognize that the church is truly an organism, an organic entity. The reason that we use the term <em>organization</em> is for the purpose of expressing and explaining an aspect of the church. However, we should never confuse our usage of the term and think that we are referring to an organization like that which exists in Catholicism and Protestantism and from which we have been delivered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR USING THE TERM <em>ORGANIZATION</em><br />
AND THE NECESSARY PRECAUTION<br />
RELATED TO USING THIS TERM</h2>
<p>We cannot avoid using the term <em>organization,</em> because even the word <em>coordination</em> sometimes cannot convey the full meaning of what we are trying to describe. Nevertheless, we must be cautious in using this term and not consider the church to be merely an organization. We must remember that the church has life within. Throughout the past two thousand years, many organizations within the church have not been according to biblical principles and have even offended the Holy Spirit. As a result, many godly people condemn the usage of the word <em>organization.</em> However, we should not avoid using this term because of its previous misuse; rather, we should consider the organization of the church according to the principles found in the Scriptures and in relation to the authority of the Holy Spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
