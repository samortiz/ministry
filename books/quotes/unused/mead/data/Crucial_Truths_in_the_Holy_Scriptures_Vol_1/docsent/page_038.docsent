   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the order in 1 Corinthians 6:11, justification follows sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Holiness is God s nature, whereas righteousness is His procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sanctification causes us to be according to God s nature, and justification makes us right according to His procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not according to His nature, we cannot be right according to His procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in the order of God s salvation, we are first sanctified and then justified; we are first made according to His nature and then made right according to His procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not to say that we obtain sanctification and justification at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, we obtain both simultaneously at the time of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in considering the order of blessing in God s salvation, sanctification comes before justification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Justification means that God declares man to be righteous according to His very righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>JUSTIFIED BEFORE GOD AT THE TIME OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Scriptures, there are three aspects of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first aspect is before God, which we obtained when we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, once we are saved, we are justified, or we may say, once we are justified, we are saved, since God s salvation includes justification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A justified person is a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not justified out of works of law ; Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him ; All our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment ; How then can a man be righteous with God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>; There is none righteous, not even one Gal 2:16; Rom 3:20; Isa 64:6; Job 25:4; Rom 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since justification is God s declaration that a man is righteous according to His righteousness, it is not possible for a man to be justified by the works of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s righteousness is absolutely perfect, but no one is perfect before the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, no flesh, that is, no fleshly person, can be justified before God by the works of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only is our unrighteousness unable to stand before God s righteousness, but even our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment before His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are unable to meet God s righteous requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not possible for us to be justified before God through the works of the law or through behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps our behavior is better than others, but it is short compared to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to God s righteousness, there is none righteous, not even one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Having been justified by His grace Titus 3:7; see also Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of man s weakness, no one can be justified before God by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, any person can be justified by God by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The law requires that man be perfect in order to be justified out of works of the law, but no one can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In justification by grace, however, God freely fulfills all His righteous requirements so that justification can be received and obtained by every man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God accomplished everything for us so that we might be justified freely without any effort or doing on our part; this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we cannot accomplish by the law, we can obtain through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are justified by grace through the redemption of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the Lord Jesus accomplishing redemption for us on the cross to satisfy God s righteous requirement, God could not justify us by His grace even if He so desired.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s justifying grace cannot come to us apart from the Lord s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When someone pays for a Bible, it can be freely given.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Similarly, God can give us His justifying grace because the Lord paid the price of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having now been justified in His blood Rom 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood of the Lord Jesus is the sign of His death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the blood is the price He paid to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The price of this blood satisfied all the requirements of God s righteousness upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, this blood causes God s grace to justify us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s blood accomplished what we could never accomplish through our behavior before God s righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can be justified before God s righteousness in the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Raised for our justification Rom 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s death and shed blood satisfied all God s righteous demands, and the Lord s resurrection is the very proof and guarantee of God s righteous requirement being satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since the Lord s death and blood fulfilled all God s righteous requirements, God raised Him from the dead for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before God the Lord s blood acts as the foundation and declaration of our justification, and the Lord s resurrection serves as the guarantee and proof of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the Lord s blood satisfied all God s righteous requirements, the Lord s resurrection causes us to be justified and accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Justified by faith ; Justified out of faith in Christ Rom 3:28; Gal 2:16; see also Rom 5:1; Gal 3:8, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible definitely tells us that man s justification before God is not, and cannot be, by works; it is only by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Works are related to what we can do; faith is related to what Christ has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Works require our effort, but faith receives and obtains without effort.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>None of us can truly work, but all of us can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Faith believes in the Lord and in what He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He died and shed His blood to accomplish redemption, satisfying God s righteous requirement so that God can justify us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then the Lord was raised from the dead so that we may be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, if we do not believe, we will have no share in Him and what He did, and we will not obtain God s justification through His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must believe, being one with Him by faith, believing into Him, and receiving Him and what He has done for us by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we will partake of Him and His redemption, obtaining God s justification through His redemption in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once we believe and receive the Lord and what He did by faith, His name and the Spirit of God justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His name justifies us in name, and the Spirit of God justifies us in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once we are one with the Lord by faith, we share in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His name causes us to be justified in name and position, and the Spirit of God causes us to experience God s justification in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Justified in Christ Gal 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are not only justified by the Lord s blood, by His resurrection, and in His name but we are also justified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are not in Him, the Lord s blood, the Lord s resurrection, and the Lord s name have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We can partake of Him, His blood, His resurrection, and His name because we are joined to the Lord and have entered into Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By being in His resurrection and His name, we are justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are justified in Christ and by Christ, never in ourselves or by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Justified freely Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our justification is free because of the grace of God, which comes through the Lord s redemption by His blood and which is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not related to any price we paid, any of our works, or anything in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From all the things...you were...justified Acts 13:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our being justified freely by God s grace through the Lord s redemption, by His blood, and in Him is not merely from a few things but from all things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once we believe, we are justified by God from all things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is God who justifies Rom 8:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is God who justifies us in the Lord upon our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It was not we ourselves or others but God who justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are justified by the only One who can condemn us and also forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Since He justified us, who can accuse us and condemn us?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Who became...to us from God...righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God not only justified us through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, declaring us righteous according to His righteousness and giving us His righteousness Rom 3:22; Phil 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He even made the Lord Jesus Himself our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once we believe into Christ, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God causes us to be in Him, clothed with Him, and covered by Him so that He might be our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Just as He is righteous and acceptable before God, we also are righteous and acceptable before God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We obtained this when we were saved.</S>
