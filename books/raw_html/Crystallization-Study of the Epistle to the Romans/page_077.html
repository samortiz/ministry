 <h2 class="head2">54. The Grace Which Was with Timothy<br />
through the Lord in His Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:22, the last verse of 2 Timothy, says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; First, we must have the Lord in our spirit. Then we have grace. Grace is not in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit where the Lord Jesus is. Actually the Lord and grace are one. Grace is the Lord personified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">55. The Grace of God Which Has Appeared<br />
to Bring Salvation to All Men</h2>
<p>Titus 2:11-13 speaks of the grace of God which has appeared to bring salvation to all men, training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age, awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. <em>Soberly</em> is toward ourselves; <em>righteously,</em> toward others; and <em>godly,</em> toward God. We have to be sober people. Actually, the worldly people are drunk. They are not sober, but foolish. Before we were saved, we did things foolishly, but now we have become sober toward ourselves. Only those who live by God as grace can deny ungodliness and worldly lusts to live a life of soberness, righteousness, and godliness in this age. We live such a life while we are awaiting the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is our great God and our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">56. The Grace of God by Which We Have Been<br />
Justified That We Might Become Heirs<br />
according to the Hope of Eternal Life</h2>
<p>God justified us by His grace that we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life (Titus 3:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">57. The Grace Which Was with the Believers<br />
Who Loved the Apostles in Faith</h2>
<p>Even to love the apostles in faith, we need the grace (Titus 3:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">58. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
Which Was in Philemon&rsquo;s Spirit Enabling<br />
Him to Receive Onesimus, Who Was<br />
His Escaped Slave, as a Brother</h2>
<p>Philemon had the grace of the Lord in his spirit, and this grace enabled him to receive Onesimus, his escaped slave, as a brother (Philem. 25). In ancient times there were the ranks of master and slave, but Philemon&rsquo;s escaped slave was saved through Paul. Paul sent him back as a brother to his master. Ordinarily, a runaway slave would have been put to death, but Paul entreated Philemon to receive his escaped slave as a brother. This needed grace. From that time on these two were brothers, not master and slave.</p>
<h2 class="head2">59. The Grace of God by Which Christ Tasted<br />
Death on Behalf of Everything (Every Man)</h2>
<p>By the grace of God, Christ tasted death for everything, that is, for every person (Heb. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">60. The Grace That Is Found for Timely<br />
Help by the Believers Who Come<br />
Forward to the Throne of Grace</h2>
<p>When the believers come to the throne of grace, they receive grace as their timely help (Heb. 4:16). We all have to receive such grace by coming forward to the throne of grace.</p>
