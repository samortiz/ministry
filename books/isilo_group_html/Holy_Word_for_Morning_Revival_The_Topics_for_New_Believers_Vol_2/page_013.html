<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Phil. 1:21 For to me, to live is Christ...</strong></p>
<p><strong>3:8 ...I have suffered the loss of all things and count <em>them</em> as refuse that I may gain Christ.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10 To know Him and the power of His resurrection...</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">&ldquo;To Live Is Christ&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Like Paul, we should hope that we magnify Christ, as always, whether through life or through death. This means that, instead of letting others see our patience, humility, sanctification, goodness, and perfection, we should let them see Christ being lived out in us. We live Him out to such an extent that for us &ldquo;to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Gaining Christ</h2>
<p>In order to live and magnify Christ, Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ (Phil. 3:8). The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; to which Paul refers are not the worldly, material things; rather, they are the things implied in verses 5-6, things of lofty thoughts and profound logic, such as religion, philosophy, culture, morality, and especially the law given by God through Moses. Paul was zealous for the law to such an extent that he said that he was blameless according to the righteousness which was in the law. However, after he was saved, the things in which he trusted in his flesh, including the righteousness of the law, he counted as loss because they became replacements of Christ that distracted him from Christ and made it impossible for him to experience Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ. Hence, he cast all those things aside completely, counting them as refuse on account of the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. He aspired to experience Christ, gain Christ, and be found in Christ (v. 9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Knowing Christ and the Power of His Resurrection</h2>
<p>To know the excellency of Christ is one thing, while to experience Christ is another thing. Paul first received the revelation to know the excellency of Christ. Then, because of such knowledge, he was willing to pay the price by considering all things to be loss, refuse, that he might gain Christ. He desired Christ to such an extent that he longed to &ldquo;know Him&rdquo; and &ldquo;the power of His resurrection&rdquo; (v. 10). Such knowledge is not objective doctrine but subjective experience. To know the excellency of Christ Jesus is by revelation, but to know Christ is by experience. It is to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Eventually, Paul experienced and enjoyed Christ; that is, he had the experiential knowledge of Him and experienced Him in the power of His resurrection. To experience Christ requires us to be in the power of His resurrection, not in our natural life. We can know, experience, and enjoy Christ by the power of His resurrection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, from the preceding twelve items we can see clearly that in actuality to be a Christian is to believe not in a religion but in Christ. What Christianity should offer to people is not religion but Christ. This Christ is excellent, living, and pleasant. He is God, He is man, and He is the Spirit who enters into us. Subjectively, He is in us to be our wisdom: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption; He is in us to be our life; and He is in us as the One who is all-inclusive and unlimitedly rich with the bountiful supply to be everything to us.</p>
<p>Toward such a One our reaction should be that it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ, who is God, man, and the Spirit, who lives in us. He is waiting to be formed in us, He wants us to live Him out and express Him, even to the extent that for us to live is Christ. We should consider the knowledge of Christ as something excellent and aspire to know such a Christ and the power of His resurrection. Thus, the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection will operate in us so that our living is full of the experience and enjoyment of Him.<sup>59</sup></p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
