   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Saturated with God Dispositionally 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Justification</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to dispositional sanctification, which comes after justification Rom 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is sanctification not merely in our position, but also in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, it is deeper and more subjective than positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In subjective sanctification we are saturated with God dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Separation can take place rather easily and in a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But to be saturated dispositionally takes a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are faithful to the Lord, we shall be saturated with the nature of God day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God intends to saturate us with Himself, and we need to soak up God in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the process of being made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has chosen us for the purpose of saturating us with Himself; He wants to work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we shall be holy, just as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At present, we are all in the process of saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been in this process more than fifty years, and I am still in it, still soaking up God day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes my wife or the brothers and sisters help me to soak Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They help me to be willing for this, even when in myself I am not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, whether I am willing or unwilling, the Lord causes me to be saturated with Him and to soak Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of us who were in Christianity for years can testify that while we were there we did not undergo very much of this saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But since we came into the church life, we have been more and more soaked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life is a life of soaking up God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether we are willing or unwilling, we are being soaked with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not care for outward correction; it means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being saturated with God and being soaked with Him, however, mean a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church life, have you been corrected or saturated?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us in the church life have been saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not appreciate self-correction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose someone is proud and adjusts himself to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only thing that matters is that we are saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a joy it is for me to see that many brothers and sisters have been saturated with God, that they have soaked up so much of Him into their being!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the holiness, the sanctification, revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all have been chosen to be holy in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Firstly, we are separated unto God; secondly, we are saturated with God; eventually we become one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day, we shall be just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That will mark the completion of our sanctification, the process that begins with separation, continues with saturation, and is completed with the full redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, from within to without, we shall be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We shall be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is for this purpose that we were chosen by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By Transformation of the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Dispositional sanctification firstly transforms our soul by saturating every part of our inward being with the holy element of God 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By Transfiguration of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, dispositional sanctification will transfigure our body into one as glorious as Christ s Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that God s holy element will saturate our body so that our body may be redeemed Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consummately to Be the Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through dispositional sanctification, all the saints will consummately be the holy city, permeated with the holy God Rev 21:2, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>V. WITHOUT BLEMISH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 4 also says that we were chosen in Him to be without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s chosen ones should be saturated only with God Himself and have no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to be without blemish, to be without any mixture, to have no element other than God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After being thoroughly washed by the water in the Word, the church will be sanctified in this way 5:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today, we still have a great deal of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many foreign particles, such as the flesh, the self, and the natural life, are still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we are gradually being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, eventually we shall be so holy and so pure that we shall be without blemish, without any foreign particles, having only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BEFORE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We shall be holy and without blemish before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before Him means to be holy and without blemish in the eyes of God according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This qualifies us to remain in and enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We shall be holy and without blemish, not according to our standard or in our eyes, but according to His standard and in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Finally, we shall be holy and without blemish before Him in love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Love here refers to the love with which God loves His chosen ones and with which His chosen ones love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is in this love, in such a love, that God s chosen ones become holy and without blemish before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Firstly, God loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then this divine love inspires us to love Him in return.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In such a condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be holy and without blemish as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this love, a mutual love, God loves us, and we return this love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is in this kind of condition that we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Under such a condition we are being saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that we can see that the holiness revealed in the Bible is absolutely different from that found in today s teachings concerning self-correction and improvement of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Firstly, we are separated unto God and then we are continually saturated with God until all the mixture in us is swallowed up by the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When this takes place in full, we shall be wholly sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God s Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we shall be completely holy.</S>
