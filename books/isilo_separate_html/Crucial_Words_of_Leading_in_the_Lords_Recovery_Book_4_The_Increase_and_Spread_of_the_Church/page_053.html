<p>Acts 1:8 tells us that our witnessing should be &ldquo;in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Today our &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is our relatives, friends, and neighbors. Our gospel does not start in Africa or Mongolia. Rather, it starts with our relatives, friends, and neighbors. When it comes to preaching the gospel, many of us are willing to go to far-away places, but we are unwilling to go to nearby places. However, the Lord&rsquo;s charge does not speak of going from the uttermost part of the earth to Jerusalem but from Jerusalem to the uttermost part of the earth. Therefore, we should start with our relatives, friends, and neighbors, preaching and working on them one by one. Thus, we should preach throughout all of Taipei and then to the towns and villages in Taiwan. Then we can preach to places that are in the uttermost parts of the earth. This is the Lord&rsquo;s sequence; this is also the Lord&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>Today we should consider those who are around us. We should pray for them, bring them before the Lord, and faithfully testify to them concerning the Lord Jesus. Within a short period of time, the gospel will spread out like ripples from a stone thrown into water. This is the Lord&rsquo;s charge to us, and this is the Lord&rsquo;s promise to us. When we go out, the economical Spirit of the Lord will be upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN EVERY HOME<br />
BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Whenever we talked about preaching the gospel in the past, we thought of putting on gospel vests, handing out gospel tracts, and holding a gospel meeting. In the meeting some brothers would lead the singing of hymns and give a message. At the end, there would be a &ldquo;drawing in of the nets&rdquo; and a collection of names. There is a degree of effectiveness in this kind of gospel preaching, but our recent practice and leading has shown us that this may not be the most effective way. The most effective way is to preach the gospel in every home every other week. If everyone preaches in this way, we will realize that everyone truly can preach the gospel. Our preaching of the gospel should be continual. The most effective way to preach the gospel is in every home continually. This kind of gospel preaching will not result in something great in an outward way, but with every member speaking in a continual way throughout the year, there will be an effective move of the Lord in the gospel.</p>
<p>We truly worship the Lord that He has unveiled this way to us and has enabled us to see this effective way. I hope that through such a fellowship, we would rise up and no longer speak of not being eloquent or of not having the gift to preach the gospel. If someone is too &ldquo;gifted,&rdquo; he can actually hinder the preaching of the gospel in the homes. For example, if someone is so strong that he sounds like thunder and lightning, it may be difficult for people to receive the gospel. The gospel can be preached in this way in a big meeting, but intense speaking in a small group often scares people off.</p>
<p>In one small group gathering in the past, a brother preached the gospel for over an hour, and then he even wanted to &ldquo;draw in the net&rdquo; in a formal way. There were only about ten brothers and sisters in the small group and two gospel friends, so his attempt to &ldquo;draw in the net&rdquo; was awkward. With a sense of desperation, the brother even asked the two gospel friends to kneel down to pray in front of everyone. The gospel friends knelt down but only out of a sense of courtesy. After this experience, they were unwilling to come to another small group gathering. When we preach the gospel in the small groups, we do not need to be too aggressive or pushy. Otherwise, it will be very easy to make our gospel friends uncomfortable. We truly need the economical Spirit in order to preach the gospel, but the power of the economical Spirit may not always manifest itself as a roaring lion; it can also manifest itself as a gentle lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging Every Brother and Sister<br />
to Open Their Homes<br />
for the Preaching of the Gospel</h2>
<p>We should encourage the brothers and sisters in the small groups to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel. This is a very crucial point. Preaching the gospel by opening our homes is different from preaching the gospel in the meeting halls because there is no place for show or fa&#231;ade; it only requires everyone to exercise his or her spirit. Preaching in this way attracts people, and it warms and comforts them. We should encourage all the saints in the small groups to open their homes to preach the gospel. Even a weak saint has something precious to offer. Many so-called weak brothers and sisters become strong when they preach the gospel. Brothers and sisters who do not speak much in a big meeting all speak in a small group gathering. When they go to a church meeting and see older saints who have been following the Lord a long time, they often do not speak. However, in a small group gathering when they see that their gospel friends are unclear about the gospel and do not know the Lord Jesus, they become bold and are burdened to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We should encourage every brother and sister in the small group gatherings to open their homes for gospel preaching, whether they are strong or weak. Sometimes the so-called weak brothers and sisters actually have more gospel friends than we do, because those who have been in the church for a long time may have fewer friends in the world. If these so-called weak brothers and sisters opened their homes to preach the gospel, they could easily invite ten or twenty relatives, friends, and neighbors to come. This is the best way to preach the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
