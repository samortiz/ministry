   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Issue of the Spirit as the Consummation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Flow of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is such a divine flow in this universe, and this flow has been consummated, or completed, by the flowing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This flow issues in the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To Seal Christ s Redeemed Ones</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>with the Essence and Likeness of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit seals Christ s redeemed ones with the essence and likeness of the Triune God, making them a particular possession of the processed Triune God Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sealing Spirit is the consummation of the divine flow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a seal is placed on a sheet of paper, the ink essence in the form, the likeness, of the seal is applied to the paper and saturates it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the ink, the form of the seal, and the paper are mingled as one item.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were like a blank piece of paper before we received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we called on the Lord Jesus, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This sealing continues until we are fully redeemed in our body Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we continue to call on the Lord, we continue to be sealed by the indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He seals us with the essence of the processed Triune God, the One who has passed through the processes of incarnation, death on the cross, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God becomes the very ink with which we are being sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now upon us, the blank paper, are the ink and the form of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are mingled with the Triune God as the sealing Spirit, and this causes us to bear His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the dispensing, the impartation, of the Triune God into our being issuing in the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Be a Pledge of God to the Sealed Ones</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After sealing us, this seal becomes a pledge of God to the sealed ones, guaranteeing that God is their inheritance for their satisfaction Eph 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we were made God s inheritance for God s enjoyment 1:11, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christ we were made an inheritance of God, and under the sealing of the Spirit, we enjoy God as the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church as the organism of the Triune God is the issue of the Spirit s sealing and pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Accomplished by the Transmission</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of the Great Power of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The dispensing of the divine Trinity to produce the organism of the Triune God is accomplished by the transmission of the great power of God Eph 1:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This power raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This power that has accomplished so much is transmitted to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The transmission of this great, divine power to the church makes it the Body of Christ, an organism of the Triune God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To the church implies a kind of transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever God has wrought in and upon Christ is transmitted to the church to make the church the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is the issue of the operating Triune God, and this issue becomes the organism of the invisible Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is altogether organic, altogether of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This life is the divine life signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are partaking of this tree of life, enjoying this divine life, so that we can be the very Body of Christ expressed in different localities as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The local churches as the expression of the one Body of Christ should have nothing to do with organization but should be totally organic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to see that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is absolutely organic.</S>
