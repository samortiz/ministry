	 <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE NEW WAY&mdash;<br />
EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>In principle, whenever the new ones ask a question, we must give them a clear explanation. In addition, from the time that they are baptized, we should take the new ones door-knocking with us so that they can learn how to sing the hymns, read the Bible, and lead the meetings. We should lead and teach them from the beginning of their Christian life, just like parents teach their children to speak and to write when they are small. In other words, we should teach the new ones <em>Life Lessons</em> and also lead them into the practice of what they are reading. If we will do this, after a year and a half, the new ones will be able to do everything that we do. They will learn how to go door-knocking and how to care for other new ones. This is our church life. Our church life is knocking on doors to preach the gospel, leading people to be baptized, having home meetings to nourish the new ones, and perfecting them. Once a week we break bread together in the meeting halls, and every three or four weeks we have a big meeting of the church for blending.</p>
<p>In the way we practiced the church life in the past, the saints were not perfected. We preached the gospel, but not many people were saved; we cared for people, but not many people remained; and we visited people, but there was no result. We have known one another for many years; hence, there was nothing for us to do but go to the big meetings. However, in the new way the needs in the church are great. At present there are at least six thousand people in Taipei who need to be cared for by the brothers and sisters. Hence, everyone must offer themselves and exercise their function. The elders should also make arrangements for the elderly saints who cannot go door-knocking or go to home meetings but can pray and fellowship in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the world knows about Christianity. People know that believers worship God every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Therefore, some of the people who come to our Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings were not contacted by door-knocking. They came to our meeting halls of their own accord because they wanted to attend a Christian meeting. For the sake of taking care of these believers, the meeting halls should have a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. If there is not a meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, they will think that the church has left, and we will owe them an apology. Hence, we need the meetings in the halls to care for these believers. In the new way, we create opportunities for those who love the Lord to be able to function. In other words, all the saints are employed. In the past the saints were unemployed, but now there is a great need for the saints to give themselves. We need everyone to function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING A NOBLE SERVICE</h2>
<p>After the period of time when the brothers and sisters went door-knocking and led home meetings, many people in the communities expressed their thankfulness to us. The new ones who were visited four or five times say continually that they admire our perseverance in visiting them. Eventually this touches them, and they are baptized. They know that we do not want to cheat them; instead, we desire to bring the Lord Jesus to them and to give them the Bible, truth, and light so that they can receive salvation. When we knock on their door the first time, they may not understand these things; hence, they might become angry and slam the door in our faces. However, after they believe in the Lord, they thank us for preaching the Lord Jesus to them and bringing salvation to them.</p>
<p>From this we can see that what we are doing in the new way is a noble service. The evils in society that are reported in the newspapers show the need for the gospel. When we knock on doors, we are bringing the gospel, life, and godliness to society. It will be a tremendous blessing for us to gospelize Taiwan.</p>
