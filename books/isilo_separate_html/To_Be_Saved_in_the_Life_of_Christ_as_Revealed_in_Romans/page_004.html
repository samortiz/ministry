If we are not submissive to the Lord who is our Master and our God, no one will be submissive to us. If we are going to reign, we must first be under someone. When we are submissive to the Lord, taking the position of one who is submissive to the Lord, immediately we have the deep sensation of grace within us. When we have the serious consideration that we are submissive to the Lord who is our Master, we feel the abundance of grace within us. When we have this sense of abundant grace, this is a sign that we are submissive to the Lord. At such a time, we reign in life. The way for us to receive the abundance of grace is to be submissive.<p>In Numbers 16 when Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rose up against Moses and Aaron, Moses fell on his face (v. 4). In falling upon his face, Moses submitted himself to Jehovah. Because of his submission, Jehovah was able to come in to deal with the situation (vv. 23-24, 31-35). It seemed that Moses was ruling and reigning. Actually, Jehovah was reigning. Jehovah&#8217;s reigning came out of Moses&#8217; submission. Surely Moses enjoyed the abundance of grace, in figure, when he submitted himself to God. The abundance of grace is just the fullness of the enjoyment of Christ. Our submission to our Master will cause the Master to come in to rule over the rebellious ones. To the rebellious ones, it is a kind of ruling, but to the submissive ones, it is the enjoyment of the abundance of grace.<p>Your rising temper is actually a &#8220;rebel.&#8221; As you submit to the Lord, all the &#8220;rebels&#8221; are subdued. You should tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I am submissive to You. I don&#8217;t agree with my rising temper, which is just a rebel. I am submissive to You.&#8221; In this way you rule over your temper.<h2 class=head2>Christ&#8217;s Redemption Being a Matter of Grace and God&#8217;s Justification Being a Matter of Righteousness</h2><p>Our experience of the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness corresponds to Christ&#8217;s redemption and God&#8217;s application of Christ&#8217;s redemption in justifying us. Christ&#8217;s redemption is a matter of grace. God&#8217;s justification is a matter of the gift of righteousness. In Christ&#8217;s redemption, we receive grace. In God&#8217;s justification, we receive the gift of righteousness. The issue of these two things is eternal life (Rom. 5:17, 21). Eventually, eternal life becomes the means, sphere, and element of our kingship. We are kings in the eternal life. This eternal life comes from the abundance of grace in Christ&#8217;s redemption and the abundance of the gift of righteousness in God&#8217;s justification.<p>Whenever there is a turmoil or rebellion surrounding you, you should not deal with it or confront it directly. Rather, you should stay in the grace of the redeeming Christ and in the gift of righteousness of the justifying God. Thus, you can say, &#8220;Lord, my Master and my God, I do submit myself to You. Lord, You know the entire situation. The entire turmoil is before Your eyes. I don&#8217;t like this kind of situation, and I surely do not agree with this situation. Lord, I like to submit myself to You.&#8221; When you say this to the Lord with a serious consideration, you have the definite and rich feeling that you are full of the abundance of the grace of Christ and the abundance of the gift of righteousness of the justifying God. At such a time, the Master, the very Lord and the very God, goes out to deal with the situation. He is ruling and reigning. His ruling and reigning will be accounted to you as your ruling and reigning. This is the way to reign in life.<h2 class=head1>BY THE DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION OF THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h2><p>We also are saved in the divine life of Christ by the dispositional sanctification of the indwelling Spirit. Sanctification in the New Testament has two aspects: positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification. Positional sanctification also has two aspects: before and after we were saved. Before we believed, the Holy Spirit came to us to sanctify us, to separate us from sin and the world before our repentance (1 Pet. 1:2). Our repentance came from the positional sanctification of the Spirit before we repented. Then, after we repented and believed, we were sanctified positionally (Heb. 10:10; 1 Cor. 1:2; cf. Matt. 23:17, 19; 1 Tim. 4:3-5) with a view to the dispositional sanctification. Then the Spirit continues to sanctify us dispositionally, day after day. This sanctification is to transform our being. Positional sanctification is objective, outside of us. But dispositional sanctification is subjective, within us (Rom. 15:16; Eph. 5:26; 1 Cor. 1:30).<p>According to Romans 15:16, Paul, as a laboring priest of the gospel of God, offered to God the nations who had been sanctified in the Holy Spirit. Paul offered to God only that which had been sanctified, wholly separated unto God. He would not offer anything common to God. His offering had to be something which was separated wholly unto God, something which was not only holy in position but also holy in disposition. The offering of the nations is in three steps. First, those who preach the gospel offer the newly saved ones to God as spiritual sacrifices (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). After the new believers grow and begin to understand what it is to be a believer in Christ, they are encouraged to offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). This is the second step of offering. Then, as the believers continue to grow unto maturity, those who labor on the believers present them full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28).<p>Dispositional sanctification is to prepare us to be an adequate offering, or sacrifice, to God. This sanctification is to save us from our disposition, which has been soaked with the element of the world. We love the world because our disposition has been soaked with the element of the world. There is not one person on this earth who does not love the world. Everyone loves the world. All the modern things of this world can easily be sold because the things of the world fit in with the inner disposition of human beings that has been soaked with the element of the world.<p>Thus, after we are saved, we need to be sanctified. Sanctification implies separation from the world. It also indicates that something is to be made holy, not common. God is holy. He has nothing to do with the world; He is altogether separate from the world. But we are very common, very worldly. Therefore, we need to be sanctified. We need to be sanctified not only in our behavior and living outwardly, but also in our disposition inwardly. We need outward, positional sanctification because our outward living is altogether worldly. We also need dispositional sanctification because our disposition has been soaked with the element of the world. Even a young boy or girl knows how to choose the worldly things. This is because worldliness has already saturated their disposition since they were born.<p>Sin is in our nature, and the element of the world is in our disposition. For this reason, all men love the world and want to be modern according to the current fashion of the world. This is because the world has saturated our disposition since the time we were born. Thus, we all need to be dispositionally sanctified. Our nature is contaminated by sin, and our disposition is contaminated by the world. The only thing that can save us from the contamination of the world is the dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
