   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX WHERE I AM YOU ALSO MAY BE Scripture Reading: John 14:3, 10-11, 16-21, 23 JOHN 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:3 the Lord said, If I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said that where He is, we also will be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where is the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In both verses 10 and 11 the Lord said, I am in the Father and the Father is in Me. These verses show where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord clearly says that He is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 16 through 19 say, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you...But you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We live because the Lord lives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these verses the Lord s living refers to His living after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His resurrection the Lord regenerated us; hence, we live because the Lord lives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 20 says, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word in is used three times in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 3 the Lord said, Where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where is the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both verses 10 and 20 say that the Lord is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, according to verse 20 the Lord wants us to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are in the Lord and He is in the Father, we are also in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 21 says, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only is the Lord in us; He will also manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is one thing to have the Lord in us, but it is another thing to have the Lord manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We often like to use the expression brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we write letters, we often write Dear brother in the Lord or Dear sister in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A saved one is a person in the Lord, and any person who is in the Lord also has the Lord in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, verse 21 says that the Lord will manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord does not manifest Himself to us because we are saved, but because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who love Him keep His commandments; that is, they walk according to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are the ones to whom the Lord manifests Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 23 the Lord said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only will the Lord manifest Himself to us, but He will also come to us and make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One translation renders make an abode with him as abide with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, in the original language, to make an abode means much more than to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is the meaning of abiding together, but these words imply more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord and the Father will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The abode mentioned in verse 23 is one of the abodes mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From our side, this abode is the Lord, but from the Lord s side, we are this abode.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From our side, God is our abode, and from God s side, we are His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If after we are saved, we love the Lord, follow Him, and keep His commandments, the Lord will manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that He will have an abode and that we also will have an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a mutual abode of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are God s abode because God is dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is our abode because we dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are mingled with God, and this mingling is an abode, a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As far as we are concerned, it is our abode, and we dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As far as God is concerned, it is God s abode, and God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord and the Father will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that all the lovers of the Lord will have an abode, and the Son and the Father will also have an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE LORD ASKING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TO SEND THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>SO THAT WHERE HE IS WE ALSO MAY BE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 3 the Lord said, So that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most people who read John 14 think that this is a reference to the Lord s bringing us to heaven because He is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, where in this verse is not a matter of heaven or earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 10 the Lord said, I am in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, where in verse 3 is not a matter of a place but of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where the Lord is does not refer to a place but to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord also said, The Father is in Me v. 10 . The Lord is in the Father, and the Father is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that the Lord and the Father are joined.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord wants us to be joined to Him, just as He is joined to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this purpose, He needs to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this message we will now consider how the Lord works.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 16 says, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Speaking concerning the Comforter, the end of verse 17 says, He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In these verses the Lord speaks of Himself, the Father, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verse 3 the Lord said that where He is, there we also will be.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord accomplishes this through His asking the Father to send the Holy Spirit.</S>
