   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR PREACHING REQUIRING PATIENCE AND ENDURANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot bring anyone to the Lord merely by good fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, the work of preaching the gospel to bring people to the Lord requires much patience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to learn Christ as our patience that we may continually fight the battle to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real preaching is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not think that we can bring the gospel to people so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle Paul used the phrase striving together v. 27 . This indicates that we need patience and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>George M ller prayed for a certain person to be saved, but that person was not saved during M ller's lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was after M ller's death that this one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not very easy and quick to bring certain persons to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It requires a real struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all have to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot do a quick work in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To preach the gospel is to have a harvest, and we cannot have a harvest in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to learn patience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was saved in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A brother in the Lord worked on me for a very long time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a time there seemed to be no result.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was too hardened in my heart, and I made up my mind to not care for what he said to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that more or less he was disappointed, and at a certain time he stopped coming to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, one day after he stopped coming although I did not know why I made up my mind to go to a Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the result of the work of that brother over a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have to learn patience in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the members of a local church, we all must have this life of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this preaching life we should not expect to do things in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we have to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we all would labor for a certain period, perhaps for two or three years, the doors will be wide open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is similar to a business in that we need to build up credit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have seen this happen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the north of mainland China, in my hometown, we spent more than eight years trying to build up credit for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the first eight years, from 1932 to 1940, we never baptized over forty people at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within those eight years there was a real struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the mercy of the Lord, however, the brothers there did their best to keep preaching all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then around 1940 the results burst out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From that time on, we always baptized one or two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Families, factories, hospitals, and schools all the doors were opened, and it was very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Taiwan we spent at least one or two years in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By that time we had learned more, and a group of trained persons came over from the mainland to carry on the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why the work that began there went so fast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, the doors were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we are just starting in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, we need some time to be trained, and on the other hand, we need time to build up credit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot sow a seed tonight and have a harvest tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is the behavior of mushrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mushrooms are not the right life; they even damage the genuine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A tree bears fruit in its time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to learn patience and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The neighbors, relatives, colleagues, and schoolmates with whom we are working may not be saved in this year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may be saved this month, but some may be saved only after five years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not know when they will be saved; only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I cannot explain why this is so, but it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some will be saved very quickly, but some will be saved very slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot care about that.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must simply go on and believe that gradually some fruit will be brought in. Therefore, we need patience.</S>
