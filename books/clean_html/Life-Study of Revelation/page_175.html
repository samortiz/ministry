<h2 class="head2">F. The Mystery of Lawlessness<br />Now Being Restrained</h2><p>Second Thessalonians 2:7 says, &ldquo;For the mystery of lawlessness is already operating; only there is one who restrains now until he comes out of the midst.&rdquo; We all know that both Christ and the church are mysteries. But here Paul speaks of another mystery&mdash;the mystery of lawlessness. Antichrist will also be a mystery. According to Paul&rsquo;s concept, this mystery of lawlessness is already operating. However, there is someone who restrains it. It is difficult to say who is restraining this lawlessness. Nevertheless, there is some force, some strength, restraining lawlessness.</p><p>The hippy movement in the United States began in the early 1960&rsquo;s. Those years were years of lawlessness. But something restrained that lawless hippy movement, and it has passed away. If there were no restraint on lawlessness, the earth would no longer be habitable. We would have no peace to sleep at night. Today, there is a tendency toward lawlessness, but it is under restraint. Because God&rsquo;s purpose has not been fulfilled, that is, because the Bride has not yet been prepared, God exercises His control over lawlessness. Eventually, at the time of the last three and a half years, this restraint will be removed, and it will seem that God has said, &ldquo;Let the world go.&rdquo; At that time, Antichrist, the lawless one, will be fully manifested, and the entire earth will be filled with lawlessness. This is a word of prophecy, and it does not seem to help us in the experience of life, which is our primary concern. Nevertheless, I hope that the young people in particular will be enlightened by all these points and say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord that I am clear concerning the tide of the world. I know what is coming.&rdquo; Praise the Lord that in the midst of the dark night we have light!</p><h2 class="head2">G. Being Consumed by the Lord<br />with the Breath of His Mouth and Destroyed<br />with the Brightness of His Coming</h2><p>Finally, in 2 Thessalonians 2:8, Paul says, &ldquo;And then the lawless one shall be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming).&rdquo; The breath of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth signifies the word. Revelation 19:15 says, &ldquo;Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations.&rdquo; This sharp sword, a two-edged sword (1:16), is the Lord&rsquo;s killing word. He will send out His word as the breath to slay Antichrist and to consume him. The Lord will also destroy Antichrist with the brightness of His coming. This brightness will be an intensified burning and a killing light. Christ will come with such a mouth and such light to deal with this man of sin. As a result, Antichrist will become the son of perdition and be the first to perish in the lake of fire. Along with the false prophet, he will perish in the lake of fire earlier than Satan will (19:20; 20:10). When we come to chapter nineteen, we shall see that Antichrist will fight directly and personally against Christ and that, at His coming, Christ and His overcomers will fight directly against him.</p><p>Thus far, we have seen seven aspects of Antichrist: the fourth beast, the little horn, the prince, the king, the all-inclusive beast, the angel of the abyss, and the man of sin. In the next message we shall see even more regarding him.</p>
