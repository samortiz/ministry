Pride Makes You a Top Fool</H2><P>This is my realization of pride. The most foolish person is a proud person, and the most wise person is a humble person. To be proud is to be a top fool.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Rivalry in the Lord's Work Is Not Only a Sign of Ambition but Also a Sign of Pride</H2><P>We often are in rivalry with people in the Lord's work. For instance, a certain place began with thirty people meeting together and now they have reached one hundred thirty. Your locality began with forty people meeting together, but now you have only sixty. Because you cannot stand someone being more successful than you, a heart of rivalry arises within you. In the world, competition brings progress. In the Lord's work, however, there must not be rivalry; rivalry kills. We need to humbly say to the Lord, "O Lord, I am an unprofitable servant. Even though there are more people meeting here with me than with the other brother, I am still an unprofitable servant." In the Gospel of Luke the Lord told us that after a servant of the Lord performs many tasks during the day and comes home in the evening, he still has to say to his Master, "I am an unprofitable slave" (17:10). We all must admit that we are unprofitable servants. We should neither compare ourselves to nor compete with others. If there is an increase in the church where we serve, it is altogether the Lord's mercy.</P><P>In my prayer my greatest delight is to praise the Lord for His abundant mercy. He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion. You have many people in your locality; it is the Lord having mercy on you. I have few people in my place; this may be because I am proud before the Lord, so I need the Lord's mercy. Always remember His mercy and His blessing. Brother Watchman Nee said that we should not be afraid of making mistakes, but we should be afraid of not having the Lord's blessing. If there is the Lord's blessing, even though we have made a mistake, we are still blessed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Caring for Your Prestige and Neglecting Others' Dignity Are a Sign of Subtle Pride</H2><P>Caring for your prestige and neglecting others' dignity are a sign of subtle pride. Co-workers and elders who are older are prone to commit the error of caring too much for their prestige. Such a person would often say that he has been working for the Lord for many years, he has established churches in certain places, and he has nourished certain localities. He always cares for his prestige. Everyone has his dignity, so you should not rebuke anyone carelessly. If you do, that means you are displaying your prestige without caring for the other person's dignity. This is also a sign of subtle pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Referring to Your Capacity, Success, Perfection, and Virtue Is a Careless Form of Pride</H2><P>Referring to your capacity, success, perfection, and virtue is a careless form of pride. Do not carelessly mention your success, your capacity, your perfection, and your virtue. Instead, always say to the Lord, "Lord, I don't have any capacity nor do I have any success in Your work. Furthermore, I don't have any perfection; all that I have is imperfection. Also, I don't have any virtue; all that I have is failure." This will preserve you from becoming proud.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
