<P>In addition to this, the Spirit of God was considered, by those who translated the New Testament into English, to be the power of God, an instrument for God's work, not a person who is ranked with the other two persons of the Divine Trinity. This is in contrast to what was emphatically mentioned by the Lord in Matthew 28:19. In that verse the Lord said, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." According to this verse, the three of the Divine Trinity are distinct persons. Therefore, the Holy Spirit of God is not only the power, the instrument, of God but also a person. Even up to the time of the publication of the King James Version in the seventeenth century, the pronoun "itself" was used in reference to the Spirit. For example, Romans 8:16 was rendered "the Spirit itself" by the King James translators. This is a wrong rendering. Since the Spirit is a person, the proper rendering in this verse should be "the Spirit Himself." All the negligence, ignorance, misunderstanding, and misinterpretation concerning the Spirit have been corrected and the truth concerning the Spirit has been completed in the Lord's recovery. Beginning in the nineteenth century the wrong use of itself in reference to the Spirit was corrected and adjusted, Himself being used in the American Standard Version, the New American Standard Bible, the Amplified Bible, and other modern versions. In the previous few decades the Lord has shown us the following points concerning His consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit.</P><P>Exodus 30:23-25 reveals that the Spirit of God has been compounded with Christ's divinity (signified by the hin of oil), Christ's humanity (signified by the four kinds of spices), Christ's death with its effectiveness (signified by myrrh and cinnamon), Christ's resurrection with its power (signified by calamus and cassia), and the Divine Trinity (signified by the three units of five hundred shekels, with the middle unit being split into two halves of two hundred fifty shekels, specifying the quantities of the four kinds of spices). Thus, the Spirit of God has become the compound Spirit as an ointment of several elements, not only of oil.</P><P>John 7:39 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveal that the Spirit of God had not been processed to become the life-giving Spirit before Christ's glorification in His resurrection. It was in His resurrection that Christ as the last Adam in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit through the process of His crucifixion and resurrection. Later, this life-giving Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9)&#151;the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), and the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). In Revelation 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 the Spirit of God eventually became the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, to deal with the degradation of the church in its dark age. After being compounded, transfigured, and intensified, the Spirit of God became "the Spirit" as the processed and consummated Spirit of God and even as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God (Rev. 22:17a).</P><P>We all need to pay our utmost attention to pick up this point, for the consummated Spirit is one of the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery. Christ today is all-inclusive, and the Spirit of God today is the consummated Spirit. The consummated Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power, to be the life-giving and indwelling Spirit is the reality, the realization, of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. All the above points that the Lord has shown us in the last few decades are great and crucial items in the Lord's recovery today.</P>
