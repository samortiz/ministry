 <h2 class="head2">12. The Grace of the Lord Jesus through Which<br />
Peter and the Jewish Believers Were Saved<br />
in the Same Way as the Gentile Believers Were</h2>
<p>There was a grace through which Peter and the Jewish believers were saved. Then they saw that the Gentiles were saved in the same way (Acts 15:11). This way was God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s grace, God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Grace of the Lord to Which Paul and<br />
Silas Were Commended by the Brothers</h2>
<p>Acts 15:40 says, &ldquo;But Paul chose Silas and went out, having been commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.&rdquo; This time we see that Paul and Silas were commended to the Lord&rsquo;s grace by the brothers. This was the start of Paul&rsquo;s second ministry journey.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Grace through Which Apollos<br />
Helped the Believers in the Region of Achaia</h2>
<p>Apollos brought and ministered God as grace in every place he went in Achaia (Acts 18:27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">15. The Grace of Which Is the Gospel Solemnly<br />
Testified by the Apostle Paul in His Ministry</h2>
<p>Paul, in his ministry, always ministered God as grace. He solemnly testified of the gospel of the grace of God to minister God into people (Acts 20:24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The Grace of Which the Word Is, to Which<br />
the Apostle Paul Committed the Ephesian Elders</h2>
<p>Paul the apostle committed the Ephesian elders to the word of God&rsquo;s grace (Acts 20:32). This grace is God&rsquo;s visitation, God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. The Grace Which Is Greater, Given by God<br />
to the Humble as It Was Prophesied<br />
in the Old Testament That God Resists<br />
the Proud but Gives Grace to the Humble</h2>
<p>James 4:6 says, &ldquo;But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, &lsquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rsquo;&rdquo; If we are humble, God will come to us, and we will experience His visitation. This is grace. God rejects the proud. That means God will not visit them. But God will come to the humble all day. When we are humble, God is with us, and this presence of God is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">18. The Grace with Mercy and Peace,<br />
Which Is with the Believers from<br />
God the Father and from Jesus Christ,<br />
the Son of the Father, in Truth and Love</h2>
<p>Second John 3 says, &ldquo;Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.&rdquo; When we live in truth and in love, that is a sign that God is with us, and that is the grace. Grace is actually God Himself visiting people. When we live in truth and love, God comes to visit us, and that is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">19. The Grace Which Was Perverted into<br />
Licentiousness by Ungodly Men, Who Denied<br />
the Only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Jude 4 says that ungodly men perverted the grace of our God into licentiousness and denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. The ungodly men perverted God&rsquo;s presence in such a sinful way and denied the headship and lordship of Christ.</p>
