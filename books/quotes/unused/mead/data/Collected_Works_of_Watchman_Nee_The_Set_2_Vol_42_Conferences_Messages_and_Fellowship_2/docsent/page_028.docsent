   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT TALKS 1 Date: October 16, 1936, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy PERSONAL LIGHT AND CORPORATE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's light for men has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is the personal aspect and the second is the corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament, the light in the temple was not a common kind of light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was the light of the lampstand, which was not supposed to go out at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The light of the lampstand typifies Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament all personal light was temporary in nature; it passed away after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the light in the temple was shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our meeting today is the temple, and in this temple there is the need for permanent light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is full of allusions to the temple as a type of the meeting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 2 says that the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 3 says that we are the temple of God and the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every time the saints gather together there is a spiritual house, and everyone is a stone built up as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today when the saints are gathered together, they become the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when we come together, we should expect a light that we would not ordinarily receive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard for an individual to see any light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when he comes together with others and they become a temple, the light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church today is like the temple; it is the place where God shines His light in an intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE LORD PERSONALLY APPEARING TO PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Question: Why did God personally appear to Paul in Acts 9?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answer: Pentecost did not fully consummate until Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prior to chapter ten, Pentecost had come to the Jews, but it had not come to the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul had the Damascus experience because the church had not fully come into existence yet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the church fully came into existence, Paul could not have accepted anything unless it was through God's direct appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God saved him, but He could not use him as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul had contacted many church members and had persecuted them by putting those who called on the Lord in every place in chains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why God had to shine His light on him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today God uses ordinary means, not supernatural means, to accomplish His works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He appeared to Paul in an extraordinary way because He needed to subdue him and bring him into submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In spite of this, He told him to enter into the city, and that someone in the city would find him and tell him what he should do 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord sent Ananias to tell him two things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, Paul was told to rise up and be baptized, washing away his sins 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, Paul was told that God had called him to be a witness among the Gentiles, bearing His name 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Paul obeyed, he received his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament, the normal way is to receive the gospel from men, but Paul received his salvation directly from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a consequence, when he wrote the book of Galatians, he proclaimed that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This revealing could have happened at the time Ananias was talking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In any case, Paul had the experience on the way to Damascus in Acts 9 because the New Testament church was not yet fully formed at that time and the baptism of the Holy Spirit was not fully consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Question: How do you explain Peter's word that younger men should be subject to the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Answer: Peter said in his first Epistle that younger men should be subject to the elders, and that we all should gird ourselves with humility toward one another 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peter did not say that the younger should obey the elders, but that the younger should be subject, or should submit, to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Obedience is a matter of conduct, whereas submission is a matter of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can only obey the Lord, yet we should submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Submission is a question of the heart, whereas obedience is a question of conduct and action.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We often obey a person without submitting to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Submission is being one with others in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is to not oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we find many wives who would obey, but few who would submit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many women do what a wife is supposed to do, but they murmur quite a bit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is obedience, but this is not submission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How many times has a wife obeyed out of submission?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One brother did not obey his father's order because the order contradicted his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He told his father, "I wish I could obey you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I wish I could do what you said and obey, but I cannot disobey God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The son was gentle, yet he could not obey his father because his father's word contradicted his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul told the slaves to obey their masters, but he told the wives to submit to rather than obey their husbands Eph 6:5; 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A woman can do many things, but she should be in subjection to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Good citizens must be subject to those who are above them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Peter said, "Be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to a king as being supreme..."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>1 Pet 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Peter did not say to obey, but to be subject to or to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Submission is not opposing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among the brothers, the younger should submit to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a matter is in harmony with God's will, we can do it, but we cannot do it if it is not in harmony with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is submission, not obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A meek spirit is a submissive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we can distinguish between submission and obedience, we will avoid many problems.</S>
