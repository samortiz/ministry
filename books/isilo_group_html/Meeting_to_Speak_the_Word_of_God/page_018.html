<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SING THE HYMNS<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE GOOD MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Hymn #837 is an excellent hymn. First, this hymn contains truth; it is a hymn on the truth related to the matter of building. After presenting the truth, it then brings in the matter of experience. Verse 6 of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;<br />
Receive us into Thy wise hands;<br />
Bend, break, and build together in Thee<br />
To be the house to meet Thy demands.</p>
<p>Verse 7 continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">Break all the natural life for us,<br />
Deal Thou with each peculiar way,<br />
That we no more independent be<br />
But with all saints are one for aye.</p>
<p>What is written here is all related to experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this hymn, with eight syllables per line, is composed of two groups of four stanzas that convey a very rhythmic feeling as we sing. A hymn composed of excellent words and matching rhyme coupled with a good meter and an appropriate melody is a very successful piece.</p>
<p>Let us now look at hymn #841. Although this is a hymn on the experience of life, it eventually leads to the building. The first two lines of this hymn are:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art all my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, In me Thou dost live...</p>
<p>The final stanza of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">I would cease completely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my efforts vain,<br />
Let Thy life transform me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full release to gain;<br />
Build me up with others<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in us Thou see<br />
Thy complete expression<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorifying Thee.</p>
<p>I am speaking these things to you so that you can realize that in order to have good meetings we must know how to sing the hymns.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Meeting to Speak the Word of God &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
