   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REIGNING A. The Disciples Going to Galilee</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Meet with Him on the Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 16 says, But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus appointed them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The constitution of the kingdom was decreed on a mountain, the heavenly King s transfiguration transpired on a high mountain, and the prophecy concerning this age was also given on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, for God s economy of the New Testament, the disciples needed to go to the mountain again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only on the high level of a mountain can we realize the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Appearing to the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Being Worshipped by Them</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 17 continues, And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, but some doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the disciples saw the resurrected King, they did nothing but worship Him; yet some among them still doubted, or hesitated, wavered, in recognizing Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Declaring That All Authority</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Has Been Given to Him</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>in Heaven and on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 18 says, And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His divinity as the only begotten Son of God, the Lord had authority over all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew s account of the resurrection is very different from John s. According to John s record, after His resurrection the Lord met with His disciples in a room where the doors had been shut John 20:19 . The disciples were frightened, being afraid of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because they needed to be strengthened by life, the Lord came to them as life, breathed upon them, and told them to receive the holy breath John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How different is Matthew s account!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Matthew, the Lord charged the disciples to go to a mountain in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely He met with them on that mountain during the day, not during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, when He met with them on the mountain, He did not breathe upon them and tell them to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He said, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew it is not a matter of breath, but a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John s concern was for life, and life requires breath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Matthew s concern was for the kingdom, and the kingdom requires authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Gospel of John reveals that we need life to care for the little lambs and to feed the Lord s flock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Matthew 28 there is no word about feeding the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew the Lord commands the disciples to disciple all the nations v. 19 to make all the nations part of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This requires authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, in John resurrection is a matter of life, power, breath, and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in Matthew it is a matter of righteousness, authority, and discipling the nations.</S>
