   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>32.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The One Living within Us</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That We May Live Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Paul said that "it is no longer I who live," he also said that "it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was Christ who lived, yet it was in Paul that He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ and Paul, they two, had one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us that Christ is not only life to us, the believers, but also a person living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have another person, Christ, living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must see this vision: the One who died on the cross for our redemption is living now in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in me through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, on the one hand, this resurrected Christ is in the third heavens; on the other hand, He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the life-giving Spirit, He lives in us to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Son did not live by Himself; He lived because of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, He lived the life of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had one life and one living with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the same in our relationship with Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We live by Him, and He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we do not exist without Christ; we live because of Him and live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we have one life and one living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only so, we live because of Him by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To eat is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we live by the Lord whom we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Philippians 1:21 Paul said, "To me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul's life was to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To him to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ was not only his life but also his living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He lived Christ because Christ lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was one with Christ both in life and in living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He and Christ had one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They lived together as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ lived within Paul as Paul's life, and Paul lived Christ without as Christ's living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ lives in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The normal experience of Christ is to live Christ, and to live Christ is to have Christ magnified always under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to practice living Christ in our daily life, whether in great things or in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our experience and practice of living Christ must reach the extent that others can see that in all things, in every detail of our life, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ lives in us as life and we live Him as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This must be something real and practical to us.</S>
