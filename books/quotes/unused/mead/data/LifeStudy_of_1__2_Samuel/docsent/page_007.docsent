   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWO THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAMUEL 1 HIS ORIGIN, BIRTH, AND YOUTH Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1:1 2:11, 18-21, 26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Samuel, beginning with his origin, birth, and youth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. HIS ORIGIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:1-20 we have a word regarding Samuel's origin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not consider that Samuel came out simply from his father, Elkanah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, Samuel came out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God had His eternal economy, but the carrying out of God's economy had come into question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God had ordained that Aaron's descendants would be the priests for the carrying out of His economy, but that priesthood became stale and waning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's heart's desire was to gain someone to replace that priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to gain such a person, God brought together in marriage Elkanah and Hannah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Elkanah had two wives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to God's sovereign arrangement, the second wife, Peninnah, had children, but Hannah had no children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, "her rival provoked her bitterly to irritate her, because Jehovah had shut up her womb" v. 6 . This forced Hannah to pray desperately not mainly for herself but for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She promised God that if He gave her a male child, she would return the child to Him by the vow of a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God was pleased with Hannah's prayer and her promise and He opened her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hannah conceived, bore a child, and named him Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this we see that actually no human being was the origin of Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God was the real origin, who motivated His people sovereignly and secretly.</S>
