   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY THE TASTE OF GOD'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Christian should not take good itself as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has to take God's life as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether a Christian should or should not do something is based upon whether or not that thing fits his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like whether or not a man drinks a certain kind of soup having nothing to do with whether or not he is glorifying God; it is a matter of his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not only exhort others not to beat their wives; we must also ask based on what does a man not beat his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A Christian does not smoke, not because smoking will not glorify God, but because smoking is contrary to his taste within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's law is written in us, because God's life is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not we like something is based on the law of a taste within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This law gives us a certain taste.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A five-month-old baby cannot write or speak; his mind and reason are not fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He cannot argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you put ginger in his mouth, he will not swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You do not have to teach him not to swallow it; it is not a question of mental knowledge, but a question of life-taste.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God created man, He put this law of life within the sense of life already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not up to the mind to decide whether a person wants something or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is up to the inner sense to decide it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you put ginger in a baby's mouth, he will not swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if you put chocolate in his mouth, he will take it and will want more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may not be able to speak with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may not even be able to distinguish clearly with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But he can tell the difference between good food and food that is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This illustration is a most appropriate one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within every Christian, there is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know how to reject everything that is contrary to the taste of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament, two passages tell us that a saved person can know God without others teaching him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two passages are in Hebrews 8 and 1 John 2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to repeat a hundred times that a Christian who has life does not need others to teach him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Chefoo a brother once asked me at a dinner if he could do something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I pointed my finger at his heart and asked, "How does that part feel?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "I know.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I know."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But soon after, he came and asked me again concerning another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I smiled and pointed my finger at his heart again, saying, "How does that part feel?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said again, "I know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I then responded, "If you know already, why do you come to ask me?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third time he came and asked the same thing again, and I answered him the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, within us, all of us know.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you say that you do not know, you are lying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real problem is not that we do not know, but that we are not willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have life, you will surely have the taste, and once you have the taste, you will surely have the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether a thing smells good or bad is not determined by our teaching, but by our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Twenty-six years ago, I saw a child eating a rice dumpling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He should have added sugar to it, but someone added salt to it instead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the child could not distinguish between salt and sugar with his eyes, when he ate it, his taste told him the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some food makes a person feel right, whereas other food makes a person feel wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Outwardly, things may look the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the taste tells the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the "law of the Spirit of life" spoken of in Romans 8 and referred to in Hebrews 8.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This law has a taste.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We reject anything that is contrary to this taste, and we accept anything that matches this taste.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every genuinely saved Christian has this taste.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Unfortunately, many Christians neglect this inner taste.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They live according to the outward standard of good and evil, and not according to the inner sense, taste, and law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we need is not teachings, but the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eight or ten years ago, if you asked me some questions, I could give you many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But today, I will tell you that the answer to all the questions is found in the taste of our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There was a story in The Christian magazine which said that once, after Moody preached the gospel, a lady told him, "I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I am not like you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have children, and I am married.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>My husband often takes me to the theater to watch the plays.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Should I go or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moody asked the lady, "Have I ever mentioned in my pulpit anything about whether or not one can go to the theater?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The lady said, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Moody then said, "What I preach is all published in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Can you find in any of the articles anything I have said about this matter?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The lady again answered, "No," but she added, "Although nothing was said, I imagine you would not like to see Christians going to the theater."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One afternoon, the lady again went with her husband to watch a play.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The minute she entered the theater, she did not have the peace within, and she left.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The husband said, "You have become crazy through listening to Mr. Moody's preaching." She answered, "No. I am not crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The taste within me has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not have the taste for this any longer."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we see that it is not a matter of outward teaching, but a matter of an inward taste of life.</S>
