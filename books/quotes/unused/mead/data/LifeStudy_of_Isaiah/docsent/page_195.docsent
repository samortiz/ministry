   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the springs of salvation for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God incarnated, He is the very embodiment of the Triune God John 1:14a; Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name of this Christ is Jesus Jehovah the Savior becoming Jehovah the salvation Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, has become the source of our eternal salvation through the process of His vicarious death for the accomplishment of the eternal redemption Heb 5:9; 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for the Lord Jesus to go from the throne in the heavens to the cross on Mount Cavalry, He had to pass through many processes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He came from and with His divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was born of a human virgin, and He passed through human living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He passed through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not think He was arrested and put on the cross unwillingly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He voluntarily gave Himself up on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was arrested, He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father and He will provide Me at once more than twelve legions of angels?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matt 26:53-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He volunteered to present Himself to the Father on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was for the accomplishment of our eternal redemption, which is the base of our eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Salvation is based upon redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God can be our Savior because He passed through the necessary processes to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based upon His redemption, He as our Redeemer becomes our Savior and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The source of salvation is the very fountain of the Triune God's salvation, out of which well up many springs Isa 12:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the processed Triune God has become our salvation v. 2 with Christ, the life-giving pneuma, as the many springs from whom the believers draw the water of life v. 3a; John 4:14; Rev 21:6 . The enjoyment of this salvation with the springs of the water of life becomes our strength and song Isa 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WAY TO DRAW WATER</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FROM THE SPRINGS OF THE DIVINE SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we want to consider the way to draw water from the springs of the divine salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, we need to be those who are repenting to turn God's anger and receive God's consolation of forgiveness Isa 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need to be those who are praising Jehovah, calling upon His name v. 4a . Furthermore, in order to draw water from the springs of salvation, we should make God's saving deeds known among the peoples and exalt His name among them v. 4b . We also need to sing to Him for He has done something majestic, and we must let this be made known in all the earth v. 5 .</S>
