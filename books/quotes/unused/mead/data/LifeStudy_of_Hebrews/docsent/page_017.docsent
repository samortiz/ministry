   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GREAT IN WHAT CHRIST IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, it is great in what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The writer of Hebrews used the term so great.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This term is difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How great is so great ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we cannot adequately describe so great, this so great a salvation is great in what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you know what Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although you may know Christ according to the four gospels, do you know Christ according to Hebrews?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. As the Son of God, as God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you know Christ as the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Probably you know Him as the Son of God in a fragmentary way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may have the subconscious concept that the Father is one God and that the Son is another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may not have this kind of terminology, but deep within you may hold this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that I say that the so great a salvation is great in what Christ is as the Son of God, as God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we say that Christ is the Son of God, we mean that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is none other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This brings us, once again, to the matter of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Bible, we may deal with this matter of the Trinity in two ways in the way of doctrine or in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day Philip, one of the Lord s disciples, said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us John 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a doctrinal question.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Doctrinally speaking, the Son is the Son and the Father is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps Philip thought to himself, The Son is now speaking to us, yet we have not seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So I will beg the Son to show us the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus did not answer Philip in the way of doctrine but in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as Philip had seen the Son, he had seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as doctrine is concerned, the Father and the Son are two, but as far as experience goes, when you see the Son, you see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians talk about the Trinity in a mental and doctrinal way, neglecting their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As I pointed out in a previous message, the Bible reveals that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Doctrinally speaking, we have the Father in us, the Son in us, and the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Experientially speaking, however, we realize that we have only one in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, to be doctrinal is one thing and to be experiential is another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From my youth, because my family was so closely related to the American missionaries, I heard a great deal about the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had a doctrinal understanding of America.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I mentally figured out what San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and New York City were like.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I came to this country in 1958, I saw these cities experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a difference!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were vastly different from my doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My experience was altogether different from my doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not trust in your doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You need experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In John Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress there is a place called Vanity Fair.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Doctrine apart from experience is such a Vanity Fair; it is a vanity bazaar that sells nothing of value.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The mental understanding of doctrine without experience is merely a vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was in that kind of vanity bazaar for seven and a half years and obtained hardly anything but doctrines and terms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I gained very little that could be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That vanity bazaar was my Chaldea.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day I crossed the river and entered the good land of the experience of Christ and of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is true of the doctrines is also true of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At a certain time, a number of our co-workers and myself felt that we had to taste and see the so-called Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So I began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually I learned that that was not a bazaar of vanity but a bazaar of confusion, a market of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you want to know how confusing that situation is today, you should visit that bazaar.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything there is confused.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Real things and false things, good things and bad things, are all mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No corner of Christendom is as confused as the so-called Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, the others and I crossed the river once again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even those in the church life need to cross the river out of their oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What you had fifteen or twenty years ago was good then, but it has become old.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time you crossed the Red Sea, but now you must cross the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Recently I saw a brother who was under my training twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I saw him, I was concerned for him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It seemed that he was still in that old region.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you not know the principle?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Originally, everything established according to the divine oracles in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy was true.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, after a certain length of time it became an old system, Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who were in that system had to cross the river.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, what you received twenty years ago was good, but now you must cross the river out of that region.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I urge you to cross the river out of your oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you try to figure out the Trinity according to your mentality, how will you explain verses 1:8 and 9?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 8 says, But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, and verse 9 says, God, Your God, has anointed You.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The words O God and Your God both refer to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It seems to mean God s God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>O God,...Your God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since the Son is God Himself, He is God; therefore, verse 8 says, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since the Son is also man, God is His God; therefore, verse 9 says, Your God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christ is not simple; He has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He is the Son of God, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is also the Son of Man, a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For the unveiling of so great a salvation, Hebrews firstly refers us to Christ as the Son of God, even as God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Son of God, even God Himself, is one of the elements of so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What God is makes the salvation so great.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This salvation is great in all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
