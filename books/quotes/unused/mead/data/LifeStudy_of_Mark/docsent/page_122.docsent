   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENTERING INTO CHRIST S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read chapter thirteen of the Gospel of Mark, we should not be distracted from the main point in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The crucial matter here is that the Lord was telling His close followers that the entire world situation is for the producing of a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This new man can be produced only through Christ s all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason we need to be brought into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you study the account of Peter s preaching on the day of Pentecost, you will see that he emphasized the two matters of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He told the people that the One they despised and crucified has been honored by God, for God raised Him from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They crucified Him, but God resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s followers were His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In particular, they were witnesses of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that Christ s death was the termination of the old creation and that His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the new creation we enjoy Him, the all-inclusive One, as our universal replacement provided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is not only our Savior He is our life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only is He everything to us; He is everything in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s economy is to produce a new man, and in this new man there is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new man Christ is in everyone, Christ is everyone, and Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to see this marvelous vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the vision of God s economy, the crucial matter for us to see is that we need to enter into Christ s death and resurrection so that we may participate in the full enjoyment of Him as the universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today as our replacement Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not our intention to argue in a doctrinal way concerning the Trinity or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our aim is to help the believers know that we need to enter into the all-inclusive death of Christ so that we may be in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in His resurrection we shall participate in Him and enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit to be our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Spirit now dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have actually become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we live in the Spirit and even live this Spirit, He will make Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE PURPOSE OF THE WORLD SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire world situation is for the completion of the re-formation of Israel and also for the completion of the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have a clear view concerning these two matters, we can see something that statesmen and politicians cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They do not realize that the world situation is for the re-formation of Israel and the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord that we know the purpose for the things happening in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank Him for a clear view of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ENJOYING CHRIST AS OUR REPLACEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only do we know where the world is in relation to God s economy; we also know where we are as believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in the death and resurrection of Christ, and we are in the enjoyment of Him as our all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many talk about being in Christ without having a full realization of what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be in Christ is to be in the full enjoyment of Him as the entire, universal replacement through His all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need the Gospel of Mark to help us see that Christ is our replacement through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not in an external, outward way that the New Testament believers entered into the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the Gospel of Mark we see that the early disciples, our representatives, followed the Lord from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, they, and also we, passed through the process leading into Christ s all-inclusive death and into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we see the vision of the all-inclusive death of Christ, we shall realize that when He was crucified, we were crucified with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, when He was resurrected, we were resurrected in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also are in ascension with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, now we can declare, Hallelujah, in Christ s resurrection and ascension I am participating in the enjoyment of Him as my replacement!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As our replacement, Christ is the indwelling, life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we live by this Spirit, the Spirit will become in us the reality of Christ Himself with His death, resurrection, and ascension as our complete and full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in this way that the new man is delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we all see the vision of the bringing forth of the new man through our participation in Christ and in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
