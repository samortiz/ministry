<h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL RECOVERIES AMONG US</h1>
<p>The spiritual recoveries among us are the most precious part of our history. The history of how God has blessed us is focused not on acts or actions but on spiritual things. The sequence of these spiritual recoveries is very meaningful, just as it was with God&rsquo;s recoveries in Protestantism. We should not be proud, but we should speak the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>All of the truth recovered among us began with the matter of salvation. The gospel was preached in China for many years, and many lovers of the Lord gave themselves to sow the seeds of the gospel. However, the Chinese believers were not clear about the matter of salvation until God began to work among us. In 1933 I went to Soochow to preach the gospel in an evangelistic hospital run by the Presbyterians. It was a large hospital, having fifty or sixty students in its nursing school alone. I was invited to stay at the hospital and preach the gospel to the nursing school students. I had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and almost all the students who had not been saved were clearly saved.</p>
<p>Once they invited me to preach the gospel in the hospital&rsquo;s chapel, and I preached from John 3:16. I told them that although they may have believed, they needed to know whether they had eternal life. This was a heavy word, and it was striking to the ears. The presiding pastor was off to the side of the room, and his gestures indicated that he did not agree with me. He kept making faces at me, trying to stop me from speaking in this way. I pointed my finger at him and said, &ldquo;You are a pastor, and you still do not know whether you are saved.&rdquo; Later, this pastor told some people that I was wrongly preaching the gospel. He said that no good Christian could know with certainty whether he was saved until the judgment at the great white throne. This was the prevailing atmosphere in Christianity in those days. People were saved, but they did not understand the truth regarding the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>The recovery of the assurance of salvation began when Brother Nee published several messages concerning salvation, such as &ldquo;The Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do You Know that You Are Saved?&rdquo; Subsequently, many brothers and sisters in China gave testimonies of being clear about their salvation. The struggle for this truth continued until Japan invaded China; the Sino-Japanese War began before this truth prevailed. Initially, the battle for this truth was severe; many pastors rose up and accused us of being too bold and too proud. They said, &ldquo;Even as elderly pastors, we do not dare say that we are saved. You have simple experiences and think that you can say that you are saved.&rdquo; However, the truth that a person is saved as soon as he believes is now preached everywhere; even those who formerly opposed us are preaching this truth. In this matter we fought the good fight.</p>
<p>Luther recovered the way of salvation through justification by faith, but he did not recover the assurance of salvation. The assurance of salvation was first recovered by the Brethren, and the booklet <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> by George Cutting made this truth clear. <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> ranks third in sales worldwide after only the Bible and <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.</em></p>
<p>Although people were saved in the past, they did not know that they were saved, and they did not have the joy of salvation. Since they did not know that they were saved, they did not have the assurance of salvation. George Cutting testified that people can not only be saved by faith but that they can immediately know that they are saved and thereby have the joy of salvation. This truth was recovered in the West; the recovery of the assurance of salvation among us began after this truth was released by the Brethren. The assurance of salvation has been fully recovered among Chinese Christians; not only do we confess this truth, but also all the orthodox preachers confess it as well. This is the first item of the recovery&mdash;the assurance of salvation.</p>
