   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SHALLOW LIFE Issue No. 36 Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12; Hosea 14:5-7; Mark 4:5-6; 16-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 4 has many important things to say concerning the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning this passage, the first thing that brothers and sisters often ask is whether this passage refers to saved ones or unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we should not ask whether the seeds refer to saved ones or unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The parable of the sower is not for the purpose of showing how these four kinds of soil relate to saved ones or unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The purpose of this parable is to show us the four kinds of conditions under which man receives God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it does not refer only to the word of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it is God's word, there will be these four kinds of reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be four reactions in the case of Gentiles receiving eternal life, and there will be four reactions in the case of Christians being perfected before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please remember that the principle and teaching covered here have to do absolutely with the condition of the one who is receiving the word; they do not have anything to do with whether or not a person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must not bring the issue of salvation into this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This passage only tells us the condition of man's receiving or refusing God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is therefore applicable to the believers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, this portion of the Scripture is not just for the Gentiles but for the Christians as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now by God's grace, I will show you the kind of living that is pleasing to God and that will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the kind of living that will last and stand the tests?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By God's grace, I will show you the deep degree to which God's word has to work in us before we can have the real growth in the divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know that all of us are after spirituality before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I know that all of us desire before the Lord that we become believers who please God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all hope that our living and work will be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt this is what we are after.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But why are there so many people who have failed along the way?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why are there so many who have only gone halfway?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How many today are fully obedient to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many are following the Lord all the way?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many who have a good start but not many who have a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not surprising for anyone to have a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is precious is a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A good start does not guarantee a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are obedient at the beginning may not be obedient at the end. When we read Leviticus, we find that those who are twenty years old are evaluated more highly than those who are sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason is that some who were fully for the Lord when they were twenty years old retired before they were sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many will follow the Lord all the way?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you were young, you were obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why then have you now slackened?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps a few years ago, things were not as they are now.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps the heart you now have is totally different from the heart you had when you first began to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps some time ago, you were willing to suffer for the Lord and endure tribulations for the sake of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But your condition today is different from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is there anyone who will follow the Lord all the way and not stop halfway?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before you encounter tribulations, and before you find things contrary to your own will, it is easy to say, "Lord, I will obey You at all costs."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when the Lord's will is different from your will, when the Lord's arrangement is different from your expectation, and when you see a great mountain blocking your way and consider it too high to climb over, you will not say before the Lord, "I will obey You at all costs."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the way many obey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the beginning, when you see the importance of God's eternal will and the seriousness of His will with respect to Christ, you make up your mind, saying, "God, I will obey at all costs."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when God's ordained way becomes different from your way, and your expectation different from God's, you drop the necessary yoke, go around the cross that is set before you, and lose your heart to follow the Lord all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, there is only one kind of life that will glorify the Lord; it is a life that bears the cross all the way to the end. Oh, we can never avoid the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are not truly dealt with by the Lord, and if we do not deny our self and take up the cross to follow Him, sooner or later we will not be able to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have not been thoroughly dealt with and have not fully consecrated ourselves once for all, there will be a day when we come face to face with something we will not be able to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>False spiritual growth can deceive us and deceive others, but sooner or later, we will see that we cannot get through in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A man can give up everything, but he cannot give up himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are not thoroughly dealt with, we will not be able to get through in anything; we will find that the price is too great to follow the Lord and will give up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we want to see the reason why some cannot follow the Lord all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May we find light from the Scripture, and may we receive help from God and revelation from the Holy Spirit to see this reason.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mark 4:5 says, "And other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Immediately it sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what happens today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To spring up is to have the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To spring up means that the seed has sprouted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To spring up means that the word is no longer just the word but has been changed to life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To spring up means that you have not only confessed the word but have received it into you; the word has begun to grow within you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To spring up means that the outer shell of the seed has been broken and the seed has sprouted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It means that you have accepted the word and made a start.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thank the Lord that we have all made a start.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word of the cross has already made a start in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Its sprout has come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the Lord said that even though some began this way, they did not have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said, "And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered" v. 6 . What kind of persons are these? They are the ones who have a good beginning but do not have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are the ones who have obeyed at the beginning but have turned back halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What kind of persons are these?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They are the ones who are willing to give up everything for the Lord at the beginning but become reluctant to do so later.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are the ones who sprang forth but have eventually dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are the ones who sprang forth but are now drying up.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To spring forth means that life is present; to dry up means that the hope that was present is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many who failed halfway had much hope at the beginning; they knew that this way was the right way, and they expected much from this right way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet after three to five months, or three to five years, they are finished and dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The life they initially had is gone, and all the signs of life have disappeared from them.</S>
