[3]  "At the end of 1922 Watchman was burdened to publish a magazine entitled The Present Testimony.
[4]  Its theme was specifically the deep things of God and was composed of messages on life with the Lord Jesus as the center, especially emphasizing His life, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His intercession, His Body, His coming back, and His kingdom.
[5]  The time of the Lord's return is at hand.
[6]  If it were not of the Lord and if there were no special reason for its existence, The Present Testimony would just be a tiring reiteration of things already said, and it would be completely useless to those who are truly men of God.
[7]  We publish this little magazine because we have received the commission from God to help His children specifically in matters relating to spiritual life and warfare.
[8]  We firmly believe that within a short period of time, God will surely gather His children into oneness so that His church might cease to be an object of hindrance, but rather would work together with God to accomplish His eternal ordination.
[9]  Prayer is the most wonderful action in the spiritual realm; it is also the most mysterious matter.
[10]  It must first be bound on earth before heaven will bind.
[11]  It does not mean that when something is bound on earth God will be forced to bind what He does not want to bind.
[12]  God in heaven is binding what has been bound on earth because He has already intended to bind what has been bound first on earth.
[13]  The fact that God is willing to follow His people's command to bind what they are binding shows that it has been God's will all along which is eternal to have such things bound.
[14]  If God's people would not sympathize with Him, if they would not subject their wills, and if they would not express their oneness with God in their prayer, God would rather delay and sit back, than do anything alone.
[15]  How many believers echo back to God His heart's desire daily before Him and empty out their hearts to seek after God and to ask for God to accomplish what they understand as God's will?
[16]  God's goal is that we be filled with His will to such an extent that we forget our own interest.
[17]  For this reason He wants us to abide in Him to learn His will in various matters and then ask according to His will.
[18]  In the past generations, God could have done many things and, in fact, would have liked to have done many things, but because His children did not work together with Him, He did not perform them.
[19]  When our will is one with God, even though we may at times ask amiss and our prayer is not answered, God still receives the benefit because He is able to work as a result of our sympathy with Him.
[20]  After servants of God see the position the kingdom occupies in God's eternal purpose, how willing are we to see the kingdom come quickly, and how eager are we to see all of God's children working with God to bring in this kingdom quickly!
[21]  The time of the kingdom will be for a thousand years.
[22]  What does this one thousand years have to do with Satan?
[23]  If we are not one with God in this matter and do not pay attention to what God pays attention to, we are not accomplishing God's eternal will, no matter how much work we have done.
[24]  God needs to gain a group of people who will sympathize with Him, who will work with Him, who will bring this age to a close, and who will bring God's kingdom in. If Christians think that their highest responsibility in this world is to save souls which is a glorious work, and we have no intention to despise it , and they merely save souls for the sake of saving souls, they have not accomplished God's highest goal.
[25]  When God's children rise up to testify for the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, they will want what God wants and hate what God hates; their will will become one with God's will, and God will rise up to work.
[26]  After the February conference, we naturally were praying and waiting for God's further leading.
[27]  Other than what God has revealed to us and the things with which He has burdened us, we dare not trust in any of our work, and we dare not do anything.
[28]  Today we want to see how mankind sinned the first time.
[29]  If we understand how the first sin was committed, we can understand how all the sins are committed in the world because, according to the Bible, there is only one principle concerning sin.
[30]  God considers the sin committed by Adam as a pattern of the countless sins that mankind would later commit.
[31]  God wants us to understand that the nature of Adam's sin is the nature of the thousandfold worse sins that men have committed since.
[32]  God wants us to understand that outwardly some sins may be refined and others may be coarse, but their nature and principle are always the same.
[33]  Adam did not trust in God, nor did he deny himself to obey God; rather, he acted alone, apart from God, and declared independence from God by trying to gain the knowledge of good and evil.
[34]  THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
[35]  The meaning of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is man acting apart from God, man pursuing goodness according to his self-will, man hastily and impatiently seeking after the knowledge that God has not granted, and man pursuing progress by his own means rather than by trusting in God.
[36]  It is altogether of the self to do anything, try to do anything, or have done anything without praying, without waiting for God, without seeking His will and clearly understanding it, without recognizing the self's weaknesses and impotence, without helplessly turning to and depending on God, and without the assurance through the inspection of the conscience that nothing of the self is involved.
[37]  You may act, work, labor, or suffer for Christ and His church, but unless you are certain that this is what God wants you to do, and unless you realize your own inability in fear and trembling and turn to God to work through Him, in God's eyes, you are sinning just like Adam.
[38]  We know that a person who does not believe in the Savior cannot be saved, regardless of how good his conduct may be.
[39]  Therefore, brothers, if an unbeliever cannot please God by his genuinely good behavior, is it possible that you can please God by your zealously good behavior?
[40]  When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God convicted us through the Holy Spirit so that we realized that our goodness was absolutely useless before Him and that we possessed nothing except sins.
[41]  Our heart is full of a sense of gratitude as we send out another issue of The Present Testimony.
[42]  If we want to understand the reason for this Scripture, we must go back to see the promise made by the children of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai.
[43]  When God appeared on Mount Sinai, He said, "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people" Exo 19:5 .
[44]  Immediately after hearing this word, without any objection, the children of Israel "answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" v. 8 . How straight forward this was! The children of Israel thought that because God had saved them, led them, supplied them, and protected them to such an extent, they would absolutely obey whatever He might require of them and whatever word of command He might speak to them.
[45]  So when God asked if they would obey His word, they all "answered together" and said they were most willing.
[46]  God must test you in practical matters to see if you really desire Him and His will.
[47]  Before we were regenerated and saved, the Holy Spirit caused us to be convicted so that we would know that we were just sinners and that all our goodness and righteousness in the past were simply filthy rags, insufficient to cover our nakedness or to save us.
[48]  We also knew that even if we tried our best to do good for the rest of our lives, our righteousness would still not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the law.
[49]  We knew we had to come to God helplessly, to receive the righteousness of the Lord Jesus and be saved through Him.
[50]  We did not realize that, just as God said we would not please Him when we were saved no matter how it looked outwardly , He would say the same thing to us after we are saved.
[51]  Brothers, God now has no other goal than to bring you to an utter end. God wants you to be disappointed about your self, to lose hope in your self, and to confess that you are incurable and worse than anyone else.
[52]  If you do not know the true character of the self and think that the self is good and capable, naturally, you will not be able to depend on God or give Him the glory.
[53]  Brothers, God spent forty years to personally guide the children of Israel through the wandering in the wilderness.
[54]  God wants you to realize that you are powerless, thoroughly corrupt, unable to bear any burden, and your heart toward Him is not perfect or chaste.
[55]  This is why God has to leave you in the wilderness, so that you will experience more of the failures of the wilderness and realize the corruption, vanity, and weakness of your self in the eyes of God.
[56]  Some have said, "I am surprised that I can commit that kind of sin."
[57]  If we say such a word, we do not know our self.
[58]  We do not know how corrupt we are and that we can commit any kind of sin.
[59]  We have to realize that other than the new life which God gave us at regeneration, we are no better than anybody else.
[60]  When you see your self as such, you may weep, but this does not mean that you are giving up your self or that you are accepting the judgment of God on your flesh.
[61]  In the past few days, I truly felt a weakness which I have never had before.
[62]  It indeed made me see that besides the grace of God, we really have nothing.
[63]  If this kind of feeling would make us rely more on God, it would certainly be a great profit.
[64]  To realize our corruption and vanity is very important; nevertheless, this should not hinder us from relying on God and from coming to serve Him.
[65]  We need to know ourselves so that we may cease our own work, not that we may feel let down in the will of God.
[66]  In the Bible God demands faith of His children.
[67]  Therefore, anything not according to the will of the good God or anything not done through the power of the good God is not good; it is sin.
[68]  My original desire was that one issue of The Present Testimony would be published each month.
[69]  Romans 6:6 and 11 through 14 explain the relationship between sin and the body in the clearest way.
[70]  Verse 6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."
[71]  In the last issue's open letter, our brother Watchman Nee told how he completed the work on that issue even though he was being stretched out in different ways.
[72]  Romans 12:1 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service."
[73]  After we have seen how much God cares for the intuition, fellowship, and conscience of the spirit, we may easily have a wrong concept that God does not care for the body, and that the body only does us harm.
[74]  God wants to lead and guide us, as He did Abraham, into Canaan, a place full of idols and often in famine.
[75]  We are now sending out another issue of The Present Testimony; it has been three months since the publication of the sixth issue!
[76]  We have kept many readers waiting for a long time, but we ourselves have been thinking about this every day.
[77]  May God grant us grace that the eighth issue will not be delayed so much.
[78]  The more our vision is enlarged to see the eternal will of God, the more joyful and hopeful we are, and the more we need to recognize clearly the boundaries which God has measured to us.
[79]  Thank the Lord that He has not disappointed us.
[80]  Dear readers, we do wish you to know how much hope we cherish in our prayers every time The Present Testimony is sent out!
[81]  We do not want the truths of God to be stored only in the heads of men, nor to be always displayed on bookshelves.
[82]  If we receive any definite revelation from God concerning our work in the future, and when there is the need to inform you of our work, we will report to you.
[83]  It is again by God's grace that we can send out this issue of The Present Testimony in peace.
[84]  We shall also see how much prayer we need in order to be fellow workers with God, and what attitude we need in order to cause Satan to be cast out of heaven.
[85]  Our greatest dangers are that we are not willing to ask God to examine all our lives and works, that we are not willing to lay aside our natural ability and opinions and wholly trust in God, and that we are not willing to stop struggling in our failures and weaknesses and look to God alone.
[86]  We really have to pray to the Lord to grant us the light of revelation that we might know ourselves and the salvation of God, in order that we may obtain the revival of the Holy Spirit.
[87]  We humbly and devoutly send out the message of this issue.
[88]  We also need the edification of the truth as much as all other children of God do.
[89]  To the brothers and sisters who have received the same heavenly calling in the Lord Jesus:
[90]  We have to see clearly that what is spoken of here is not a matter of experience no matter what experience one may have ; rather, it is a matter of divine fact.
[91]  "They who are of Christ Jesus" whether they be strong or weak "have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."
[92]  God says that our flesh has been crucified on the cross, and we acknowledge that what God says is true.
[93]  It is good to receive grace from God, but it is also important not to forget God's grace.
[94]  The word "letter" in 2 Corinthians 3:6 refers to the law.
[95]  When the law is compared to the Holy Spirit, the former kills because it does not have the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit.
[96]  What is the distinction between receiving the truth by the Holy Spirit and receiving the truth by the mind?
[97]  First, anyone who receives the truth from a book, a teacher, or even from the Bible itself without praying, dropping his own strength, and relying on the Holy Spirit is receiving the truth by his mind.
[98]  When Christ was incarnated, He included all flesh in Him.
[99]  After a believer is regenerated, he should know two very important things: how much he has gained through regeneration and how much of his natural disposition remains.
[100]  The reason for this is that as soon as a man is regenerated and receives the new life, this life will turn him away from the reign of the flesh to submit to this new life.
[101]  Our hope is that God's children will fully overcome sin, the world, and the devil in this age through applying the accomplishment of Christ's death and resurrection, to the extent that we all can testify that our Lord is indeed living and resurrected.
[102]  We all know that we are sinners and that we have eternal life through faith.
[103]  Today we want to see to what extent God saves us through Jesus Christ.
[104]  In other words, to what extent will our person be saved by God through Jesus Christ?
[105]  Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[106]  Mark 12:30-31 says, " And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.'
[107]  If we cannot love God to the extent of "with all," if there are still other persons, other objects, or other things besides God as the center of our love, and moreover, if we cannot love others as ourselves in addition to loving God, then the salvation we have obtained is not complete.
[108]  This verse tells us that God can save our mind to the extent that we are transformed by its renewing and that we can prove the will of God.
[109]  Philippians 4:6-7 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
[110]  These two verses say that God can save a person's heart and thoughts, delivering him from anxiety.
[111]  Romans 8:12 says, "So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh."
[112]  This verse says that God can save us to the extent that we can overcome the demand of the fleshly nature and be released from the demand of the fleshly lusts.
[113]  When we say that God can save us so that we can overcome the natural need and be free from the demand of lust, we mean that if we are hungry and without money, we can overcome the demand of hunger and refuse any illegal means of satisfaction.
[114]  Romans 6:13 says, "Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God."
[115]  Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
[116]  This verse says that God is saving us not only to the extent of being crucified with Christ, but also to the extent of having Christ living in us right now.
[117]  We must realize that to be resurrected together with the Lord is not an experience which only takes place after regeneration.
[118]  In Genesis 2:18-23 there are two types: Adam, who typifies Christ, and Eve, who typifies the church Eph 5:31-32 .
[119]  Ephesians 5:25-29 speaks of the believers' relationship with Christ; Genesis 2:18-23 speaks of the believers' relationship with God.
[120]  In Genesis 2 we can see a big difference between the thoughts of God and the thoughts of man.
[121]  God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."
[122]  The messages in this issue closely follow the previous issue No. 15 . May the Lord bless all of us so that we would truly gain something.
[123]  We saw last Lord's Day that it is possible for the life of every Christian to reach the stage of perfection.
[124]  It is possible for him to be fully obedient to God and to fully honor and love God.
[125]  According to the Bible, a Christian should be one who is fully subject to God, one who is completely free from the love of the world, one who does not go along with his self-will at all, one who does not sin at all, and one who is never once agitated by temptations.
[126]  We may aspire, weep, repent, and say to God, "O God, I truly desire to obey You."
[127]  God ordained not only that Christ should die for us on Golgotha, but that He should become our life.
[128]  Therefore, if anyone says that we do not have Christ within us, even though we have believed in the Lord, and that we ought to receive the word of Christ, he is making a great mistake.
[129]  Surrendering is to not promise God that we will do His will and do good; it is to not covenant with God to do what we cannot do.
[130]  When you come to God, you should tell Him, "I am giving You all that I have, including my good, evil, what I want, what I do not want, what I will, what I will not, what I can do, and what I cannot do."
[131]  After we have surrendered ourselves, we must believe that God can deliver us from our love, our reluctance, and our inabilities.
[132]  When we commit our ways to God, we believe that the Lord living within us will bring them to pass.
[133]  Then I said, "All right, then see what the Bible says: For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death'" v. 2 . He said, "The Bible says that I have been freed from the law of sin and of death." I then asked, "Are you free?" He replied, "I dare not say." I said, "Where is your faith?"
[134]  Although we obtained everything at the time of regeneration, unless we exercise our will to commit ourselves to God and allow Christ to live, God will never force us.
[135]  We have to first lift up our heads to tell God that we are committing everything into His hand, and, second, we have to believe that God has accomplished everything according to His Word.
[136]  Even when a believer is willing to consecrate himself to God, he still thinks that he must work and accomplish what he has consecrated himself to do, in order to please God.
[137]  By the grace of God, we are sending out this issue of The Present Testimony.
[138]  We humbly pray that God will use His truth to edify both you and us.
[139]  Although we have seen much need in the church of God, we are not yet made ready by Him.
[140]  We request that all the brothers and sisters who have placed hope in us would pray much for us, so that the portion of the work that God has assigned to us will not be delayed by us.
[141]  TWO SIDES OF A MOST GLORIOUS TRUTH Issue No. 17 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-18
[142]  We know that the Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul when he was imprisoned in Rome.
[143]  Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved."
[144]  Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."
[145]  God wants to work to the extent that we are able.
[146]  Abraham asked an old servant to bring back Rebekah.
[147]  D.M. Panton of England said once, "Whatever God can do, we can do also, since we have God abiding in us." When one sister died, there was a word about her on a sign which said, "She did what she could not do!"
[148]  "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" v. 6 . How is this related to forgiveness? Because you have faith within, you are able to say to your hating heart, "Hatred, get away from me." Since you have such faith, when others ask you for forgiveness, you are able to say, "I forgive you." Since you believe that God has done it, you are able to do it.
[149]  There are two aspects to our union with God: one is a union in life, and the other is a union in the will.
[150]  Our union with God in life refers to receiving the life of God at the time of our regeneration.
[151]  Just as God lives through the Holy Spirit, we also, henceforth, live through the Holy Spirit.
[152]  If our will is not fully joined to God, salvation has not yet been fully accomplished; man is not yet in full harmony with God.
[153]  GOD'S MASTERPIECE A RECORD OF A LORD'S DAY MEETING
[154]  The first section speaks of what one receives by the riches of God's grace the apostle told the believers the measure they had received, that God in Christ had blessed them with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies vv.
[155]  Second, these verses tell what Christ has accomplished; third, they explain how we can obtain what Christ has accomplished; and fourth, they speak of what we should do after we have obtained what Christ has accomplished.
[156]  According to the age of this world can be translated "according to the fashion of this world."
[157]  Ephesians 2:4 says, "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us."
[158]  If you are tempted this afternoon to lose your temper, you may think that victory over temptation is not by struggling but by life, and in so thinking you may pray to God, "O God, please make me alive, raise me up, and seat me in the heavenlies."
[159]  It is by grace not that I want to be made alive, but God has made me alive; not that I want to be raised up, but God has raised me up; not that I want to sit in the heavenlies, but God has seated me in the heavenlies.
[160]  Verse 8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."
[161]  THE CONSCIENCE OF THE BELIEVERS Issue No. 18 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:20-21
[162]  After the spirit of a believer has been regenerated, his conscience is enlivened.
[163]  The precious blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses his conscience, causing his conscience to be pure and keen and enabling it to follow the will of the Spirit to do His work.
[164]  Our conscience testifies to us whether or not we are right toward men and God, whether or not what we do, think, or say measure up to God's will, and whether or not we are without rebellion to Christ.
[165]  If we want to walk in the Spirit, we have to listen to the leading of the conscience.
[166]  Accepting the rebuking of the conscience, without condition and reservation, and willingly and absolutely following the conscience's revelation show whether or not our sacrifices to God are complete, whether or not we really hate sins, and whether or not we have an honest desire to do God's will.
[167]  We have read Colossians 2:11: "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."
[168]  Verse 12 says, "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed."
[169]  We were not only bought by God, but also born of God.
[170]  We thank and praise God because this verse tells us that we were circumcised in Christ.
[171]  If you think that what you have heard today is right and that you have really been circumcised because you are a little more patient, or if you think that you have really been circumcised once you have overcome temptation, then let me tell you that this is not faith.
[172]  If you truly believe God's Word, considering whatever God says of you to be true, the inexhaustible power of God will be manifested in you, enabling you to overcome temptations and sins that were previously insurmountable.
[173]  If we allow the Holy Spirit to do a deeper work through the cross, the circumcision we received will become more real each day.
[174]  "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" Phil 3:3 .
[175]  If we want to boast in Christ and want Him to boast in us, if we want to glory in Christ Jesus in our experience, we must, on one hand, receive the circumcision of the cross and, on the other hand, learn to worship in the Holy Spirit.
