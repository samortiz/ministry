   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 17:8-12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8 And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw 1 no one except Jesus Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>10 And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that 1 Elijah must come first?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>11 And He answered and said, 1 Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12 But I say to you that 1 Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8 1 Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, i.e., the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is today's Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is also today's Elijah; as such, He speaks for God and speaks forth God within His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>10 1 This was according to Mal 4:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>11 1 This will be fulfilled at the time of the great tribulation, when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses Rev 11:3-4 , as prophesied in Mal 4:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>12 1 This refers to John the Baptist v. 13 , who came in the spirit and power of Elijah Luke 1:13-17 and was rejected 11:18 and beheaded 14:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, when the disciples saw the Lord Jesus, they saw no one except Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was a lesson to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the One imparting the law of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 9 we see the principle that the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who is not in resurrection is not qualified to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we will be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only to those in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus charged the disciples not to talk about His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that Elijah would come and restore all things v. 11 . This word indicates that the coming of the kingdom was not yet in full.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the future there will be a full manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John the Baptist was Elijah, but he was not Elijah in full.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The full coming of Elijah will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible the fulfillment of prophecy is often like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First there is a partial fulfillment, then the complete fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we see in Christ's transfiguration a miniature of the coming manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The miniature assures us that the full manifestation will come.</S>
