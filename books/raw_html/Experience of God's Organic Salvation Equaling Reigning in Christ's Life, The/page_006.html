<h2 class="head3">2. The Means of Renewing<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>Such a washing, such a renewing, in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is being carried out continually in us by means of the following matters.</p><h2 class="head4">a. By the Renewing Spirit Spreading into Our Mind</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is by the renewing Spirit (Titus 3:5) mingling with our regenerated spirit as one spirit to spread into our mind (Eph. 4:22-24) and infuse our inward parts with God&rsquo;s attributes, which are forever new and never become old, thereby renewing our entire being. Our God is newness itself. In the entire universe, God alone is new and everything else is old. This God, who is forever new and who never becomes old, infuses His ever-new essence into us to renew our entire being.</p><h2 class="head4">b. By Our Walking in Newness of the Divine Life</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our walking in the newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 6:4).</p><p>In order to walk in newness of life, we need, on the one hand, to put off the old man, and on the other hand, to put on the new man. To put off the old man is to deny and renounce our old self and to apply the cross to the self. Furthermore, we need to put on the new man, that is, to apply what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is what it means to walk in newness of life. All these matters are for the renewing Spirit to renew us by imparting the new essence and new element into us that we may be renewed day by day.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By Our Being Consumed<br />by the Environmental Sufferings</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our being consumed by the environmental sufferings for the killing of our outer man and the renewing of our inner man day by day (2 Cor. 4:16).</p><p>God&rsquo;s renewing us is accomplished through the consuming by the outward environmental sufferings. Our sufferings are for us to be renewed. Although our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day. In order to renew us, God has arranged all kinds of environments to come to us for a positive purpose, that is, to dispense God&rsquo;s new essence and new element into us. We should have such a daily subjective experience of our outer man decaying and our inner man being renewed day by day.</p><h2 class="head3">3. That We May Ultimately Become as New<br />as the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Through such a renewing we are built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).</p><p>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate issue and goal of the sixty-six books of the Bible. Concerning the New Jerusalem, we have published dozens of messages and composed more than ten hymns. I hope that we would sing these hymns often. If in our singing of these hymns, we would follow each word and line with our spirit, we will receive a divine transfusion. Such a divine transfusion will issue in our becoming a part of the New Jerusalem. I repeat, do not consider that the New Jerusalem is something physical. The New Jerusalem is something divine, organic, and spiritual. It is the organic constitution of God and man, both having passed through a long process. It is the totality of the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man, expressed in the universe for eternity.</p><p>I hope that this kind of message is not just for our listening and speaking. Rather, we should experience it subjectively day by day that we may really come out of the old creation and enter into the status of the new creation so that eventually we will become a group of people who are absolutely for God, a genuine new creation that is wholly of God and for God.</p>
