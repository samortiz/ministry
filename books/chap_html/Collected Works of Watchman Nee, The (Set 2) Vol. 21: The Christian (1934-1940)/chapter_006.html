<H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION BY BAPTISM</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 5 and 6</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 6:1-9; 8:1a, 4-5, 13-21; 1 Pet. 3:20-21; Mark 16:16a</H1><P>We are all familiar with the story of Noah. Most church- goers are also well acquainted with this story. We have probably heard the story of the ark many times. Today we want to consider what the Bible really teaches us concerning the ark. In the Bible there are different meanings to the matter of salvation. In some cases, salvation has to do with our position before God. In other cases it has to do with our acceptance before Him. Some cases have to do with our fellowship with God, while others have to do with our position in the world. It seems that salvation is not that simple and is somewhat confusing. But I can explain and clarify this with a little illustration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW TYPES OF SALVATION</H2><P>In Genesis 3 we see the coats of skins. "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them" (v. 21). This is a type of salvation. But which aspect of salvation does it typify? It typifies our justification before God. The sacrifice of Abel in Genesis 4 is also a type of salvation. God was not pleased with the sacrifice of Cain, but accepted the sacrifice of Abel. Because Cain offered his sacrifice out of himself, God was not pleased with it. Abel's sacrifice was based on the redeeming lamb and accepted by God. All the sacrifices in the Bible speak of God's acceptance. The story of the prodigal son in Luke 15 also speaks of God's acceptance of sinners. Ephesians 1 says that God has accepted us in His Beloved. Hence, Genesis 4 is a type of salvation in which God accepts man. The rapture of Enoch in Genesis 5 is also a type of salvation. It is a type of salvation in the aspect of overcoming death.</P><P>Genesis 3 is a type of justification. Genesis 4 is a type of God's acceptance, and Genesis 5 is a type of victory over death. The ark in chapter six is also a type. But this type is different from those in Genesis 3 through 5. The first type speaks of our justification before God; the second type speaks of our acceptance before God; while the third speaks of victory over death and receiving eternal life. In chapter six we see the relationship between a Christian and the world. How can a Christian be delivered from all the things that God has condemned? How can he be delivered from all the things that are under God's judgment? The way we receive God's salvation speaks of the way to be delivered from God's condemnation and judgment. This kind of deliverance is one in which we escape out of a certain kind of snare.</P><P>There are different kinds of sins. The sins mentioned in Genesis 3 through 6 are all different. Sin against God is mentioned in chapter three; it is a sin before God, a sin of disobedience against God. Man's sin before God requires God's coats of skins for covering so that man can be justified before God. Sin against both God and one's neighbor is mentioned in chapter four. Cain committed the sin of murdering his own brother. He broke two of God's commandments: to love the Lord our God with all our heart, all our mind, and all our soul and to love our neighbor as ourselves. This sin requires a sacrifice before one can be accepted again before God. Even when a person has committed a sin before men, he has to be accepted before God first; without this his sin is not yet behind him. The sin of forgetting God is mentioned in chapter five; it is different from the sins in chapters three and four. Men ignored God and acted according to their own will. Daily they ate their own bread and lived their own lives. But in this chapter we see one man who walked with God. While the whole world was filled with death, and man rejected God, He delivered Enoch out of that world of death, and caused him not to see death. The sin of the world as a whole being in opposition to God is mentioned in chapter six. The sin in chapter three is personal sin; the sin in chapter four is one person's sin against another; the sin in chapter five is the sin of the majority of the people; while the sin in chapter six is the corporate sin. Chapter six is on humanity as a world organization, association, and sphere. Consequently, the sin in chapter six speaks of the whole human race sinning against God. Chapter six presents the sphere of the world; it speaks of the world having sinned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE JUDGMENT OF THE FLOOD</H2><P>Now let us consider chapter six. The beginning of this chapter speaks of fallen angels and sinful men, and how they collaborated to sin. We do not have to ask about the special significance of this passage. All we need to know is that the sons of God, who were fallen angels, and the daughters of men, who were sinful men, were both created by God; they both had spirits. When they collaborated to sin, that was the end of the world. In the first world the angels sinned, and in the second world men sinned. Hence, when angels and men joined together to sin, we know that the end was near, and the sinful angels and sinful men were about to be judged by God.</P><P>By this time, man had become extremely fleshly. Whether he was practicing good in the flesh or committing sins in the flesh, he had become utterly fleshly. Therefore, God would not strive with him anymore. Originally, the Spirit of God strove with man. But now man had disobeyed God and degraded to the point where God's Spirit could no longer strive with him. In other words, man had become so corrupt that God's Spirit was no longer able to contend with him. To put it in another way, man had become so corrupt that even the Holy Spirit could not change him. When a man has become fleshly, the Holy Spirit can do nothing about him; even his own devices cannot change him. As a result the Holy Spirit could only retreat and allow the world to go through judgment. Please remember that our flesh today is no better than man's flesh in Noah's time. If a man has not crucified his flesh with its lusts on the cross, the Holy Spirit cannot operate on him. The Holy Spirit does not exhort man to improve himself, because man can never improve himself. The Holy Spirit only convicts man to be born again. There is no ability in the flesh to do good and not sin. Only those who are regenerated and who have received the new life can meet God's standard. Being regenerated is not merely to weep, confess, become zealous, study the Bible much, or pray much. Being regenerated is to receive another life, a life that comes from God. It is inheriting another life from God. Regeneration is being born a second time.</P>
