<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY CAUSING THE BELIEVERS TO BECOME GOD’S MASTERPIECE, THE NEW MAN, GOD’S KINGDOM FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION, GOD’S HOUSE FOR THE DISPENSING OF HIS LOVE, AND GOD’S DWELLING PLACE FOR HIS REST</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The dispensing of God the Father in the life in God the Son enlivening the believers (who were in death) together with Christ, raising them up together with Christ, and seating them together with Christ in the heavenlies, thereby creating the believers as His masterpiece:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be His church.</li>	<li>That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His (the Triune God’s) grace of life—Eph. 2:1-10.<br><br>	Ephesians 2:1-10<br>	And you, being dead in your offenses and sins, (2) in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience; (3) among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; (4) but God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, (5) even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), (6) and raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, (7) that He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. (8) For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: (9) not of works that no one should boast. (10) For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.</li>	</ol></li><li>The divine dispensing of God the Son creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, through His death on the cross and with His divine element, for God to accomplish His divine economy, thereby causing the two groups of believers:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be reconciled in one Body to God.</li>	<li>To enjoy Christ as the peace between the two and between them and God—Eph. 2:11-17.<br><br>	Ephesians 2:11-17<br>	Wherefore remember that once you, the nations in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand, (12) that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. (13) But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ. (14) For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, (15) having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace, (16) and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it; (17) and coming, He preached the gospel of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near.</li>	</ol></li><li>The divine dispensing of God the Spirit enabling both groups that compose the new man to have access in Him unto God the Father, thereby causing the Body as the new man to become:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The kingdom of the Triune God for His administration.</li>	<li>The house of God for the dispensing of His love.</li>	<li>The dwelling place of God in the believers’ spirit for His rest—Eph. 2:18-22.<br><br>	Ephesians 2:18-22<br>	For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. (19) So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, (20) being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, (21) in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, (22) in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
