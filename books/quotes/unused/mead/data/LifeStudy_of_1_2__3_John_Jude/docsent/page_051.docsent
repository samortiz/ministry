   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING GOD SUBJECTIVELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not know God merely in an objective, doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is in this way that the Jews know God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They know God objectively, apart from any subjective experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that they do not have any inner experience of the subjective God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as those who have been born of God and who possess God s life, we know Him not merely objectively, but in particular we know Him subjectively and experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we know our God in this way, we cannot speak certain things, do certain things, or go certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others may even defame us and falsely accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, because we know God subjectively, often we shall not have any desire to vindicate ourselves or argue in our own defense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter what others may say, we know that we have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have God within us as our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually this indwelling One will be expressed in our character and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is in this way that we know God experientially, and this knowing is a strong sign that we are in Him and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our behavior and way of speaking, we should bear a sign that we are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not talk with others the same way that unbelievers do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If your husband or wife, your children, your neighbors, and your classmates or co-workers cannot see a sign that you behave yourself according to the experience of God, then there is a question whether you are truly in God or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We thank the Lord that those in the Lord s recovery do have the testimony in their daily life that they are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We bear a sign that we are in God, even though at some times we are weak and fail Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We thank the Lord that we have some evidence, some sign, in our daily walk that we are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sign is an indication that we know the Lord experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we know Him experientially, spontaneously we keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ABIDING IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:6 John goes on to say, He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as that One walked.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be in Christ is the start of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was God s doing once for all 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To abide in Him is the continuation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is our responsibility in our daily walk, a walk which is a copy of Christ s walk on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because God has put us in Christ once for all, we now must bear the responsibility to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To abide in Him is actually to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the negative side, this requires that we deal with our sins; on the positive side, this requires that we keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>LOVING GOD AND THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the context of these verses, the Lord s word here refers to His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His commandments are to love God and to love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We love our begetting Father, and we love all His children, all those begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are abiding in the Lord, having fellowship with Him, our abiding in Him spontaneously issues in love for God and for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the second condition, the second requirement, of fellowship is that we love God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word used for love in verse 5 is agape.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This word denotes a love higher and nobler than that denoted by the Greek word phileo.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only agape with its verb forms is used in this Epistle for love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse the love of God denotes our love toward God, which is generated by His love within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The love of God, the word of the Lord, and God Himself are all related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we keep the Lord s word, God s love has been perfected in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is altogether a matter of the divine life, and this life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s love is His inward essence, and the Lord s word supplies us with this divine essence, with which we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word itself is not this essence or substance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word is what conveys this essence and supplies it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the word supplies us with the very essence of God, which is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, we have something substantial within us for us to participate in and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that eventually the essence of God s being becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then out of this enjoyment there will be an issue our love for God and His children.</S>
