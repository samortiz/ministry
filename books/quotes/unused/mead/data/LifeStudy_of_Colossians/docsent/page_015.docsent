   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PREEMINENCE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With this as the background, we need to see that Christ is the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Colossians reveals that Christ is preeminent, that He has the first place in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both in the first creation and in the new creation Christ occupies the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1:15 we are told that Christ is the firstborn of all creation, and in 1:18, that He is the firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The new creation of God is by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For Christ to be preeminent in the new creation means that He is the first in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the first both in creation and in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that He is the first in the old creation, the universe, and in the new creation, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The universe is the environment in which the church exists as the Body of Christ to express Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is not only first in the church, the Body, but also first in the environment, the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that He is first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Colossians 1:19 says, For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the fullness spoken of in this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many would answer that it is the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this is correct, here Paul does not modify the word fullness by a phrase such as of the Godhead or of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He simply says that all the fullness was pleased, was happy, to dwell in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is something in this universe known as the fullness, and this fullness is pleased to dwell in the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians fail to distinguish between the fullness and the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they speak of the fullness of the Spirit, they mean the riches of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1:19 fullness does not denote the riches of what God is, but the expression of those riches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the expression of the rich being of God, both in creation and in the church, dwells in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All creation and all the church are filled with Christ as such an expression of God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a fullness is pleased with this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is pleasant to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fullness here means expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If something has no fullness, it cannot be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if a thing has fullness, it can be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if I have very little love, my love cannot be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if my love is full, the fullness of my love will be its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same principle, the fullness is the expression of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1:19 Paul speaks of the fullness as the fullness, using no word to modify it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that he is speaking of the unique fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To modify the fullness in any way would imply that it is not unique.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to preserve the uniqueness of the fullness, Paul did not use a modifier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the fullness here is simply the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fullness, the expression of God, is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many of the personal pronouns in the verses following 1:19 refer to the fullness as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that the fullness is the expression of God, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this fullness the Son is preeminent, for all the fullness is pleased to dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, He must have the first place in the environment and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the preeminent One.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is also the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the reality of all the positive things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we know the Bible and God s economy, we shall realize that Christ is the heavens, the earth, the sun, life, light, the star, trees, flowers, water, air, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The material things are pictures of what He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, Christ is all the divine attributes, such as power, holiness, righteousness, kindness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is also the human virtues, such as humility and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, He is the church and every member of the church, God s building and every stone in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that Christ is you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some twist our words and falsely accuse us of teaching pantheism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pantheism is the satanic belief that identifies God with the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is devilish, and we repudiate it without reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But according to the revelation of the Bible, we must testify that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we say that Christ is you and me, we do not mean that we are God or that we shall ever become God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, when we say that Christ is the real food see John 6:55 , we do not mean that physical food is God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a concept is not only absurd, but also satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who accuse us of teaching pantheism have never seen the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the all-inclusive One, Christ is the centrality and universality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This expression was first used by Brother Nee in 1934, at the third overcomer conference held in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He pointed out from the book of Colossians that the all-inclusive Christ is the center and the circumference of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is both the centrality and universality of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the hub and also the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Again I say that this is not pantheism.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is simply a statement of the fact that Christ is both the center and the circumference of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I first heard Brother Nee speak of the centrality and universality of Christ, I was greatly surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Never before had I heard such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From my experience in the years since 1934 I can testify that Christ truly is the center and the circumference, the centrality and universality of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In God s economy Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The saints in Colosse were wrong in turning to religion and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such things are against God s economy, where there is room only for Christ, the One who is all and in all.</S>
