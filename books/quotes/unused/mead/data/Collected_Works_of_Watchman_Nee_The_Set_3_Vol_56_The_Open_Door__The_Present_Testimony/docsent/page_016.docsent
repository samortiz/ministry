   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meetings Are Looking Up Mei County</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through eight fellowship meetings in Mei County concerning the church service and the way of the gospel, the brothers have gained the benefit and have been revived.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should give glory to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Last Lord's Day November 5 , we preached the gospel in two separate places, and it was especially good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers were extremely zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This week there were two gospel times in which we recorded the names of twenty-six believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are now increasing our visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord gives us grace, we will soon have a baptism meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have divided into three homes for the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Lord's mercy, the three home prayer meetings have been very living recently.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The other meetings are looking up as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The newly saved brothers and almost all of those who have fallen have turned back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can only thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We began work on the meeting hall yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have estimates of the costs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It should hold between three and five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will cost around eight or nine million.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only ask the Lord to prepare it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jia Xiu-gi, Lee Feng-xiang, Liu Chao-ren, and Hao Yung-en</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>November 15, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I Have Circled in the Wilderness Long Enough</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Charhar Province</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am weak and useless; it has been ten years since I left you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As I look back over this portion of the way, I can say nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am ashamed and embarrassed at forgetting the Lord's grace and going against righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there have been a few times during this period when I have been stirred up to make a resolve, they were useless in the end. Although I have continued to pray and read the Bible, I have not had any new light or gain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In summary, I can only say that when one leaves the Lord, one can only sin; when one leaves the Body, one is even more impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am a lonely, pitiful member who is not worthy to fellowship with you, but I have not forgotten you and the dear, estimable brothers and sisters in Shanghai, especially Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will never forget what I received from him and the help I got from all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes I have wanted to write you a letter to ask for your news, but I felt as if I had somehow offended you and I stopped myself from writing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I deeply feel that I have circled in the wilderness too long.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will not and dare not fall any further.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that this is not an activity of the flesh or an expression of the emotions, but that the Lord has had mercy on this worm that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I really am worse than a dead dog.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After leaving Shanghai and returning to Shacheng, I announced immediately that I was leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time there were a few brothers who met together to serve the Lord, but because the flesh had not been dealt with enough, the result was a house built on sand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, I moved back to my home town and used medicine to serve the sick in the village.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I also did some farming and learned the skill of knitting to maintain my livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am now formally practicing medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In my family of seven, we see the Lord's grace everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There used to be a few sisters who met with us, but they have now moved to other places, and we only worship as a family on the Lord's Day .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I reach this point in my writing, I can only shed tears of deep-felt remorse that I have not done anything for the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have often thought that I am merely waiting for the wedding feast perhaps I will not have a portion?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. Oh, may the Lord have mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother, please remember the cries of this weak one in the poor, remote countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A weak member in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Pei Han-zao</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>December 28, 1950</S>
