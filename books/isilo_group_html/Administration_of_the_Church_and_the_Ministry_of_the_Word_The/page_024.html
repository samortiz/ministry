<p>God&rsquo;s blessing to the church is in the oneness. The Holy Spirit moves in the oneness, the power of the gospel is in the oneness, the authority of God is in the oneness, the light of God is in the oneness, and the supply of the divine life is also in the oneness. However, in order to have the oneness, there must be the building up. Without the building up, there is no genuine oneness. Even if there is a kind of oneness, it will not last. Only when we are built up can we have the genuine oneness. We may serve together without being one. We may not have opinions but still not be one. Only when we are built up can there be the oneness. We do not abound in God&rsquo;s blessing, and His presence is not evident among us, because there is not enough building among us. This is strong proof that we lack submission to authority.</p>
<p>We may not argue in our meetings, but we are not in one accord, because there is not much building among us. When the brothers and sisters come to the meeting, there is neither harmony nor coordination in their spirit. Even the serving ones are independent. This shows that we have not been built up.</p>
<p>We love the Lord and have risen up to pursue Him. Even though we may feel uneasy when we miss the meetings, this does not show that we have been built up. We pray when we are inspired and are silent when we are not inspired. We do not care for the condition of the brothers and sisters and are not bothered about being an isolated Christian. Although we are saved and come to the meetings, we are detached and isolated. Even the full-time serving ones are like this. When they come to a meeting, they are isolated and detached in their spirit. This causes the spirit of the meeting to be weak.</p>
<p>If the full-time serving ones are harmonious, coordinated, and in one accord, the meeting will be strong, rich, and full of blessing. This proves that God&rsquo;s presence is in the building up. Hence, the key to God&rsquo;s blessing and God&rsquo;s presence is in the building among the serving ones.</p>
<p>A car is a good illustration. When we step on the accelerator, the car moves because it has been &ldquo;built up.&rdquo; If we only have separate car parts that are nicely painted, the car will not move, because the separated parts are not &ldquo;built up.&rdquo; In the same principle, sometimes the serving ones in a meeting have been &ldquo;taken apart.&rdquo; They are not coordinated; rather, they are independent, doing their own thing. This shows that the serving ones have not been built together. This makes it difficult for the brothers and sisters who are under their care to be built up. The result is that the prayers and activities in the meetings are independent and individualistic, not corporate and not in oneness.</p>
<p>A pile of good auto parts that have not been assembled or coordinated is useless. Because there is no building, there is no way for the car to move. In 1946 I labored in Shanghai and Nanking. Every time I went back to Nanking, I had a clear sense of one accord, whether it was in the singing, prayer, or the message. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting all the saints in the church in Nanking testified the same thing; they were our letters of commendation. Even those who went to the meetings occasionally felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Today I sense a loose spirit in many meetings. Every person is distinctly an individual. We function according to inspiration. We pray or call a hymn when we are inspired. However, we are disconnected and unrelated. Although we do not quarrel, there is no building. There is not only the absence of organic building; there is even the tearing down. For example, two brothers may coordinate well together, but after others join them, they are stumbled in their coordination. Since we are detached and lack the building, it is not easy to see God&rsquo;s blessing and presence in our midst.</p>
<p>It is not easy to see God&rsquo;s presence in individual spirituality. His presence is manifested where there is one accord, where there is harmony. Hence, in Matthew 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (vv. 19-20).</p>
<p>If there is no one accord among us, we cannot expect any blessing even if we labor diligently without quarrels or arguments. Others may achieve great success with little effort, but we have little success no matter how much we apply ourselves. Even if we have God&rsquo;s blessing, and our work helps others to learn in life, receive spiritual edification, and love the Lord, we will not be able to carry out an eternal work. Our work will not produce the building. It will not cause the saints to serve the Lord in love, being dependent on one another and making them His dwelling place. God does not want people merely to be saved and become spiritual. He wants the building.</p>
<p>If we have only edification but have not allowed God to do a building work in us, we may administrate the church as elders, but our administration will lack the element of building. Whether we are co-workers or those who minister the word, we will not produce the result of building. Our speaking may bring people to salvation and cause people to become spiritual, but it cannot produce something for the building. We may be able to gather much material for the building and work on it, but these materials will not be able to be built together with other materials. We may be able to visit people and help them to become spiritual, but there will not be any building.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us to make us humble. We should not think that as long as we can save a few people for the Lord, we know how to do God&rsquo;s work. This is not what God wants. God wants a building. Where there is the building, there is the oneness; where there is the oneness, there is something genuine. This is what God wants.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
