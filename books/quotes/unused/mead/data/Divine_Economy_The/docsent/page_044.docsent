   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CHRIST BAPTIZING ALL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BELIEVERS IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>INTO ONE BODY Scripture Reading: Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 11:15, 16; 1 Cor 12:13, 7-10, 28-31; 14:4-6, 19-25; 3:16; 6:19, 17; 2 Cor 1:21, 22; 3:3, 6, 17, 18; Rev 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament two aspects of the Spirit are revealed the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of life is within us, while the Spirit of power is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of life is essential, and the Spirit of power is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything that is economical is not as crucial as something which is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit of life comes to us and reaches and enters into us as the divine essence to constitute us into something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the Spirit of power is not related to the divine essence but to the economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many New Testament readers and teachers have not been clear concerning the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TWO LINES AND TWO PROMISES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the Spirit, in the New Testament there is the line of life and the line of power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Gospel of John there is the Spirit of life 6:63; 20:22 , and in Paul's Epistles there are many references to the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Romans 8:2 Paul used the term "the Spirit of life," and in 2 Corinthians 3:6 he says, "the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in the writings of Luke there is another line.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke 24:49 says, "And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here the power refers to the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not something inside but outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Luke even illustrates that the Spirit of power is like an article of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Clothing is put upon us for a certain purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A policeman's uniform is his clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While he is on duty, he must have his uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without such a uniform, the policeman has no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Medical doctors likewise put on their white coats.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit of power is likened to a uniform to cover us that we may function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts is the continuation of Luke's writing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus said, "You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was to receive the power from on high v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The line of life is within; the line of power is without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the promise given by the Lord Jesus concerning the coming of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This promise is not concerning the Spirit of power, but the Spirit of life, and was fulfilled on the day of resurrection in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the day of resurrection, there was the fulfillment of another promise, the promise in Joel 2:28-32 Acts 2:16-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was referred to by the Lord Jesus in Luke 24:49.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fulfillment in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost was the fulfillment of God the Father's promise in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Joel 2 the promise of God the Father was concerning the Spirit as power to enable people to prophesy, to see visions, and to dream dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This has nothing to do with life.</S>
