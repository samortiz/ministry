   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The cross brings Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ lives in me as patience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He lives in me as all the human virtues which are considered by others as ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need Christ, but without the experience of the cross, we cannot experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hymn #631 says, "If no death, no life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means, "If no cross, no Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, "If no Christ, no Spirit, and if no Spirit, no fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why the cross is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord used the words his cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a particular portion of the cross for each one of us to cross each one of us out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The young sisters among us need to experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a sister to contact a brother in a loose and careless way is behavior without the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The top virtue of a female is her feeling or sense of being a female.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way a sister dresses should be appropriate to her position in the Lord as a female.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why it is not scriptural for the sisters to wear pants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This annuls the difference between male and female and leads to many sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "A woman shall not put on a man's belongings, nor shall a man wear a woman's garment; for everyone who does these things is an abomination to Jehovah your God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I appreciate the environment of freedom in which the children of America are raised, but this freedom can lead to looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A female should have the proper sense of her position in the Lord as a female.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A number of the young Chinese sisters among us are in the self in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Generally speaking, the Chinese educate their daughters to be somewhat quiet and hidden, and this has molded many of the young sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, they are not so frank or open in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever they speak, they speak in a way that is begging for pity from others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They always want the sympathy of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person who is begging for sympathy will eventually be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person who does not expect anyone to regard him, to respect him, or to give him sympathy cannot be easily offended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An object like a chair cannot be offended no matter how I treat it because it is senseless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are so easily offended by others because we are so sensitive to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the saints stand up to speak, they may desire to see how the leading brothers will respond.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the brothers say "Amen," they will be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the brothers do not respond much, they may be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that there may be a kind of begging and expectation within us for others to regard us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Much of our criticism of others is because we are too sensitive to ourselves and too conscious of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we did not have such a strong self, we would not be offended by others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times we criticize others because we have been offended.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are offended because we are so sensitive to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We expect everyone to treat us right according to our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If someone does not treat us right according to our opinion, we are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, sooner or later, criticism will come out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would like to mention another point in helping us to be useful in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we expect the Lord to use us more, we have to learn to speak for the Lord in the meeting with a proper tone, a proper sound.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some do not speak in such a proper way because they are so sensitive to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such ones cannot be used by the Lord in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They speak in the meetings in a self-pitying way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They love themselves, uplift themselves, and preserve themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In their speaking, they display that they are full of self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The cross is mainly for dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord said that if we desire to follow Him, we must deny ourselves and take up our cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, to bear the cross is to deny the self, to put the self to death, to apply the cross of Christ to the self all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have a strong self and are offended by everything and by everyone, we cannot have real fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order for us to have the horizontal fellowship, we need to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To deny ourselves means to be senseless about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we can never be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need the experience of the cross to deepen our experience of the divine fellowship.</S>
