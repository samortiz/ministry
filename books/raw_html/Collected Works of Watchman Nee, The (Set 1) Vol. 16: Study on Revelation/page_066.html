<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 18:3</H2><P>"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury."</P><P>This verse speaks of three things:</P><P>(1) "All the nations." All the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication (cf. 17:2), which especially refers to the religious aspect of Rome.</P><P>(2) "The kings of the earth." They committed fornication with her (cf. 17:2; 18:9), which touches both the Roman religion as well as the city.</P><P>(3) "The merchants of the earth." They have become rich by the power of her luxury (cf. 18:15), which especially refers to the aspects of Roman commerce.</P><P>The last clause of 18:3 shows God's attitude towards commerce. Probably in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more commerce. Commerce prospers here probably because of the abundance of luxury. It is not good in the eyes of God for merchants to provide for men's luxury and work for their own profit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 18:4</H2><P>"And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues." </P><P>"Her" refers to both the city of Rome and the religion of Rome. There are lightnings and an earthquake right after God pours out His seventh bowl (16:17-18). Then God remembers the great city of Babylon, and great hail comes down (16:19, 21). Chapter seventeen tells us that Babylon is the great harlot, because upon her forehead is written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT." It also reveals her history, the coming of Antichrist in the future, and her end. Chapter eighteen then tells us that Babylon the Great is fallen.</P><P>Although the command to "come out of her" is given at this time, it is directed at those who are in Babylon the Great in 17:5, because within religious Babylon, there are also those who truly belong to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 18:5</H2><P>"For her sins have accumulated up to heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses." </P><P>This verse matches 16:19. Both say that God has remembered Babylon the Great. Chapter seventeen says only that God will destroy the religious part, while chapter eighteen says that the whole great Babylon will be destroyed.</P><P>Every time God remembers a sin, He immediately punishes. When God remembers, He remembers clearly; when God forgets, He forgets completely.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 18:6</H2><P>"Pay her back even as she has paid, and double to her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix to her double."</P><P>This fulfills the words in Romans 2:6-9. Does the word "double" here contradict the phrase "render to each according to his works"? It could mean that there are two times of rendering.</P><P>"In the cup which she has mixed." God will also judge the city of Rome for its sins related to the religious aspect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 18:7</H2><P>"As much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, as much torment and sorrow give to her; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow." </P><P>The church does not glorify herself; instead, she glorifies Christ. Not only does Rome do the opposite, she also lives luxuriously.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Revelation 18:8</H2><P>"Therefore in one day her plagues will come, death and sorrow and famine, and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong."</P><P>There is sorrow when there is torment. God gives her torment in order to make her sorrowful.</P><P>"The Lord God" is God's name in the Old Testament. Thus, God resumes His Old Testament position.</P>
