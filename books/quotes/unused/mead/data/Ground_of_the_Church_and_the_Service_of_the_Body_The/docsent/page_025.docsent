   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRINCIPLES AND DETAILS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELATED TO DISTRICT MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters may ask why our meetings are held in districts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, it is according to the teaching in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible large local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem, met in different homes, which served as district meetings Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our problem is not that we fail to practice according to the biblical principle but that our district meetings have become too large.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because every district meeting covers a wide area, we need to readjust so that we may have the proper situation for the practice of the district meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, we need to see that the church of God on the earth is a matter of expression and that it cannot be separated from human community.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is only one church because there is only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is only one Head of the church; hence, the church as the Body of Christ can be only one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, it is impossible for all the saints of God to be one church in respect to time, space, and church administration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, in His Word God gives us the principle of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The definition of locality is a place where a human community gathers and resides.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every city forms a place where people gather and reside, and it is the boundary of the local church, as ordained in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To state it less precisely, the church of God lodges in human communities, or societies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is of God and not of the world John 17:14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is separated from the world 15:19; 17:19 , yet it remains in the world v. 15 . Today the city of Taipei is a large city, and within it some have been saved and regenerated to become the church; hence, in Taipei there is an expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These saved ones, who become the church, are separated from the world by God; nevertheless, due to physical limitations, they continue to exist in communities, living and walking accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, we can say that the church lodges in human communities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows that in God s ordination the unit for the expression of the church is a city, or locality, the same unit in which people gather and reside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the church there is no greater or higher unit, nor is there a smaller or lower unit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within a community the basic constituent is the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, it is probably more accurate to say that households are the basic unit within communities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because the majority of individuals do not live alone but share a house with others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, a city or locality takes the home as its basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as the city, or locality, is concerned, the home is a very important unit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible we see that the local churches were the center of the believers living and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the churches took the city, the place where people gather and reside, as the unit of their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, these local churches met in many different homes, just as a city, or community, is divided into many homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see that there is a difference between spiritual homes and physical households.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For instance, there may have been two thousand households of saved ones in Jerusalem, but there could not have been exactly two thousand spiritual homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, a number of households probably joined together to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, Acts 12 says that there was a spiritual home in the house of Mary, the mother of John, and that a considerable number assembled together and prayed v. 12 . From this we see that a spiritual home includes not merely those within a single household but also neighboring households; therefore, once a physical home becomes a spiritual home, the number of people included is much greater than those within the household.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We practice the district meetings according to the principle in the Bible, that is, to gather people from one area of a city into a spiritual home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At present, there are six district meetings in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In principle this is right, but in practice there are too many people in each meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, it appears that the spiritual homes include too many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At present we are trying to change not the terminology or the principle but the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the findings of our study, we want to subdivide the districts even more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be more convenient for the brothers and sisters, and at the same time it will give them more opportunity to develop their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition, we want to broaden the administrative authority by delegating more authority to the various district meetings so that the brothers and sisters may be kept in an orderly condition.</S>
