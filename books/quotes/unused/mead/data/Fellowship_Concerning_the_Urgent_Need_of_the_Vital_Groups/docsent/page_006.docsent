   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank You that You have exposed us, that You have shown us our shortage, and that You have shown us what You need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we thank You for all these things, yet we are still ignorant concerning the proper experience of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we are still looking to You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Show us Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Show us how to face the situation and how to meet the need at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need Your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not like to do anything by ourselves, by our wisdom, or on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are in fear and trembling before You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not like to speak anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, save us and rescue us from making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not like to be misled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, cover us against all the devices of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We desire to be preserved, and we desire to be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, cover us and give us a clear understanding and an open spirit without any prejudice or hint of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not like to be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, cover us from all these things that we may have a clear, pure, and even purified fellowship so that You can show us Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE HISTORY CONCERNING THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message I will fellowship a few points which we have seen from history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament shows us clearly that in the beginning of the church life the meetings were first in the homes Acts 2:46; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fact that the saints were meeting in their homes indicates strongly that they met together in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was a group in every home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The larger gatherings were needed, but the larger gatherings were not a daily need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The daily need was the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The record in the New Testament does not make the group meetings as definite as what is being revealed to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason for this may be that the divine revelation is always released after the experiences of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First comes the experience of God s people; then God s revelation follows.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no example in the entire Bible of God s revelation coming before the experience of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God called Abraham, but if Abraham had not gone on, the divine revelation would not have come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the revelations in the Bible came as God s people went on in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because Abel, Enoch, and Noah went on with God, God was able to reveal something through each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the close of the New Testament the church had existed on the earth for less than a century.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, was written in approximately A.D. 90.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time the church had not experienced very much, so the revelation stopped there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, according to the record in the heavens, the book of Acts is still going on; it has never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the book of Acts, many centuries of church history have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In all the going on of the church we can see something further.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Brother Nee was raised up, he started the first church meeting in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That first church meeting was surely a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was not there in the first ten years of our history in the recovery, from 1922 to 1932, but when I came into the work, Brother Nee purposely told me the details concerning those ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the first four or five years the number attending the meetings was increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This increase was due to the spontaneous practice of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the beginning there was not a large meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after ten years the situation changed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From 1927 through 1932 the church in Shanghai grew in size to about one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the number reached one hundred, the rate of increase became very low.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1933 I began to serve in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, Brother Nee committed to me the responsibility for the church and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, I was very busy, but on the other hand, from today s point of view, I was not very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First of all, I gave a message on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time the main thing was the Lord s Day morning message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the message was good, the meeting would be a success; if the message was not good, the meeting would be a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank the Lord, to some extent the messages I gave were a success.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every Lord s Day morning I gave a message.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The people and Brother Nee were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I also was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I was young, I put my whole being into my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today I cannot speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time I did not need a microphone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would speak for an hour and ten minutes, and my whole being would be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consequently, I needed the entire next day to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, on Mondays I was quite free.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The second thing I did was to take care of the weekly meetings, mainly the prayer meeting and a brothers fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The brothers fellowship meeting was for the practice of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because all the brothers were priests, the meeting had no chairman or clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even though I was not charged to take the lead in that meeting, I still was there unconsciously taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The third thing I did was to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although I rarely went out to visit people, and people rarely came to fellowship with me, I did visit, fellowship, and contact the saints on occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I also took care of the correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By studying the past history and our present situation, I have realized that if we had had the way of the group meetings in 1933, we could have gained several times as many people as we gained at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This would have made us very busy.</S>
