[2]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN
[3]  Some of us have been very much affected by Western missionaries and by the mission societies behind these missionaries.
[4]  The brothers and sisters who want to migrate must have special vocational skills.
[5]  TAKING THE WAY OF THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH
[6]  THE WHOLE BODY SERVING Returning to the Condition of the Early Church
[7]  How long has the church been on the earth?
[8]  Unless we have the thought that the church has not been altered, we all should want to go back to the church in its original state.
[9]  If one individual among all the brothers and sisters will not answer God's call and go forward, God cannot go on with the whole, and He cannot get through in the church.
[10]  In this age God is taking the quick way, the way of recovery.
[11]  The least He can ask of the church is for the entire Body to rise up, migrate, and spread the gospel.
[12]  God's servant has released His speaking and His light, and the brothers and sisters have sensed this inner urge and need within them.
[13]  To hand ourselves over means that we hand ourselves and our possessions over to meet God's demand on the one hand and that we give ourselves to the church, accept the arrangement of the church, and give ourselves to coordination and training on the other hand.
[14]  Second, the elders must not be afraid of troubles.
[15]  For example, the matter of hospitality is the most troublesome work, especially when it comes to taking care of troublesome guests.
[16]  All the elders have to know God's will for the church in Hong Kong today, the way He wants the church to take, the things He wants the church to do, and what He requires of the brothers and sisters.
[17]  The elders must not neglect the inward need of any brother or sister in the church.
[18]  The saints have inward needs, and the church cannot ignore these needs.
[19]  In addition to the light which God has shown us through His servants, we have to pay attention to the spiritual needs within the brothers and sisters, because all these needs speak of God's work within them.
[20]  THE WAY TO SERVE TODAY THE WHOLE BODY SERVING The Brothers and Sisters
[21]  Hong Kong is a big place; it needs a strong church to carry out the proper service.
[22]  Hong Kong does not need a strong gospel giant, but it does need a strong church to rise up to preach the gospel.
[23]  We should never think that we have the church as long as we have a wooden table to conduct the Lord's table or that we have the church as long as we have a few strong members.
[24]  What I saw in 1949 was much more than what I saw in 1939.
[25]  I saw that God intends for the church to become a solid and sure Body, an institution that brings salvation to men, and an entity that fights, edifies, and heals.
[26]  Watchman Nee: The worst thing that an elder or deacon can do in the church is to reduce a big thing to a small one and then make a small thing nothing at all.
[27]  The first thing the deacons should pay attention to is to be dealt with by God in their very person; they have to build up a proper character.
[28]  How much have you, the person, been dealt with in the hand of God?
[29]  The best way for the deacons to deal with the self is through handling business affairs in the church.
[30]  A deacon experiences the greatest dealing in his self and his flesh; through the service, the self receives the most merciless breaking.
[31]  But in order to serve as a deacon and fulfill our duty, we have to hand ourselves over; we cannot do as we please.
[32]  If we do not behave politely, however, we will clash with the brothers and sisters.
[33]  The job of the deacons is not only to be trained and to get things done but to raise up people and perfect them.
[34]  They must not only strive and learn to do things properly themselves but must continually raise up others to do the same thing.
[35]  The goal of work in the church is not just to get things done but to raise up proper vessels.
[36]  It is wrong to have many people in the meetings and many things waiting to be done but not have the proper people to do them.
[37]  Watchman Nee: In the church there is no human authority; there is only the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[38]  The church has been here on earth for a long time, but God has never entrusted its service to any human individuals.
[39]  In the church not even the elders are the authority.
[40]  If the brothers and sisters have been dealt with by the Spirit in a deep way, they will know immediately if a church is in rebellion.
[41]  Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we thank and praise You for becoming flesh, living a life on the earth, bringing God's will, His work, and His word to the world, and showing us a clear way to go on.
[42]  Lord, we confess that the church in Hong Kong is in a fallen state.
[43]  THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN THE DISTRICTS Caring for and Cherishing the Saints like Elders
[44]  If we cannot do this, we are merely splitting our meetings into districts; we have not fulfilled the real purpose of subdivision, which is to spread the care to the districts.
[45]  OF THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN A DISTRICT Not Acting according to Emotions
[46]  The responsible ones in a district should work like a machine.
[47]  This is especially true in their coordination with the brothers and sisters.
[48]  We have to take care of visiting new believers in a proper way.
[49]  HOW TO CONDUCT A BIBLE STUDY Date:February 20, 1950
[50]  F. W. Grant said that the book of Romans is a complete and accurate thesis on the gospel.
[51]  Witness Lee: The first verse gives us the noun-subject.
[52]  Paul began with the word Paulos, his own name.
[53]  Witness Lee: I feel that as long as Brother Nee is here, I do not have any burden in my spirit.
[54]  My spirit seems to be resting, sleeping, yet Brother Nee wants me to say something.
[55]  If we do not work according to His laws, we can pray all we want and be as godly as we want, but nothing will happen.
[56]  The Lesson of the Rod Turning into a Serpent
[57]  Let me first speak on the miracle of the rod turning into a serpent.
[58]  Although we may not have an actual rod in our hands, we all have something upon which our livelihood depends.
[59]  Following this, God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom.
[60]  He put it in his bosom, and when he took it out, it was leprous as snow.
[61]  If we know our flesh, we will not dare criticize the brothers, even when we feel the urge to do so.
[62]  Watchman Nee: The above three basic lessons can be summarized under one basic principle seeing.
[63]  Once a man sees, he will spontaneously be separated.
[64]  Without God's revelation, we will only see the rod, we will see that our hands are clean, and we will regard the supply of Egypt as nothing but river water.
[65]  But once we have God's revelation, we will not feel the same.
[66]  We will see that the rod in our hand is a serpent, that our hands are not clean, and that the world is full of death.
[67]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE CHRISTIAN PATHWAY Date: Evening, February 23, 1950
[68]  Let me ask Brother Chia why he consecrated himself.
[69]  He answers, "Because I love to do it inwardly.
[70]  Unless this matter was settled, it would have been impossible for God's gospel to spread, and there would have been no way for the brothers and sisters to have a genuine revival.
[71]  If we feel that we are bound, that our fellowship with the brothers and sisters is blocked, and that the supply of the brothers and sisters produces little effect in us, we do not have to think of things we have to do for the Lord.
[72]  Some may say that a person as demanding as Christ is too hard to approach.
[73]  But once we answer His demand, we will feel refreshed and happy within.
[74]  Whenever we feel that Christ has a demand within us and we answer this demand, we will feel happy.
[75]  CHAPTER THIRTY THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING Date:Evening, February 24, 1950
[76]  When a man expresses his spiritual sentiments in songs, many times his mind is not very clear, but his spirit is clear.
[77]  Witness Lee: Ephesians 4:11-16 is on the building up of the Body of Christ.
[78]  Verse 12 says that all the gifts should be unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[79]  Why did we leave the denominations in the first place?
[80]  We left them because we felt that our need for serving the Lord was not met.
[81]  God wants the whole church to rise up to serve Him.
[82]  If we frustrate and stop the brothers and sisters from serving, we are offending the Holy Spirit.
[83]  Once we see God working in the brothers and sisters and in the church, we have to be prepared; the universal service is just around the corner.
[84]  THE PROPER ATTITUDE IN A MEETING Knowing the Lord's Will
[85]  Watchman Nee: Before every meeting, the responsible brothers must come together to open their hearts to the Lord.
[86]  You have to ask the Lord together: "What do You want to achieve in tonight's meeting?"
[87]  Witness Lee: Visitation is the most important work in the church.
[88]  We ask all the responsible ones in the districts to make arrangements for the brothers and sisters to make visitations.
[89]  As soon as a man believes in the Lord, the responsible brothers have to arrange for brothers and sisters to visit him, to strengthen his faith, and to make him feel that the church cares for him.
[90]  We have said that the brothers and sisters should beware that they do not build up any friendship outside the love of the Lord.
[91]  In doing something, we may come across some knowledge of the brothers and sisters.
[92]  Other than trying to understand what we need to know, we must avoid trying to know too much about the brothers and sisters.
[93]  Even if you do know something, you should not tell others about it lightly.
[94]  In dealing with the brothers and sisters, you have to act in the principle of "two or three."
[95]  If the feeling of the whole church is to deal with a certain brother, it will be easy to touch such a person's conscience.
[96]  The responsible brothers must learn to be bold on the one hand and to be in fear on the other hand.
[97]  If we feel that we are no longer shining inwardly, we have to ask the Lord if something is wrong with us.
[98]  Witness Lee: A few days ago we fellowshipped about answering the demand of Christ within us.
[99]  We may pass on some doctrines to the brothers, telling them that we are all for the Lord, for the saints, and for the church, and as such we should drop our opinions.
[100]  If we harbor a sin, if we have some worldly cravings or carnal objects that we have not given up, or if we still jealously guard our self, ideas, inclinations, and concepts from His dealing even though they were touched by the Spirit, we may say that we are one with the brothers and sisters, but in reality we cannot be joined to another lover of the Lord.
[101]  Ephesians 4:15b says that we have to be joined to the Head Christ in all things.
[102]  We have to ask ourselves all the time: Do we have a constant sweet fellowship with Christ?
[103]  We should not only ask if our conscience is at peace, but ask whether or not we have fellowship with Christ.
[104]  This means after we have fellowship with Christ, we must still ask ourselves whether or not we are fitly framed together with the brothers and sisters.
[105]  Watchman Nee: During the past few days Brother Lee has been urging me to speak, but I do not know what kind of thoughts are within him.
[106]  CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 6 Date:February 27, 1950
[107]  Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong ONE BODY AND ONE SPIRIT
[108]  First Corinthians 12 14 is mainly on spiritual inspiration.
[109]  Although chapter thirteen deals specifically with love, it speaks of the relationship between love and gifts; it is not just an expos on the doctrine of love.
[110]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[111]  For example, the church in Philippi was in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel on the one hand, and yet found itself not being of one mind and not thinking the same thing on the other hand Phil 1:5; 2:2; 4:2 .
[112]  Hence, we must not only receive Christ, but also we must be baptized in one Spirit into one Body and must drink one Spirit.
[113]  Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong THE IMPORTANCE OF SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS
[114]  Both Brother Lee and I have felt that many brothers and sisters are lacking in spiritual consciousness.
[115]  In order for God to have a way through the church, His children must recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[116]  Whether or not a man knows the authority of the Holy Spirit depends on his spiritual consciousness.
[117]  If he is lacking in spiritual consciousness, he will not know anything about the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[118]  If none of the responsible brothers and sisters have any spiritual discernment and if they merely coordinate by assigning works to the different groups, they may think that they have a spiritual consciousness and that they are sincere in their coordination, but in reality they are in big trouble.
[119]  When Brother Lee gives a message, the first thing I notice is not how well he expounds the Bible or how appropriate his illustrations are.
[120]  In listening to him, I first touch his spirit with my spirit.
[121]  The main question is whether or not the spirit is released.
[122]  In order to develop spiritual consciousness, one must not only use his spirit but must touch the feeling of his spirit all the time.
[123]  THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS One Must Be a Regenerated Person
[124]  Brother Chu: How do we exercise ourselves to develop a spiritual consciousness?
[125]  Watchman Nee: In order to answer this question we have to come back to the starting point regeneration.
[126]  In John 3 the Lord Jesus said that unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . He meant that in order to know the things of God's kingdom, that is, in order to know the spiritual things, one must be born again.
[127]  After one has a renewed understanding, he must still have his faculties exercised.
[128]  He must be able to touch the spirit's feelings.
[129]  Let me repeat this word again and again to the elders: If the leading ones are not quick and sharp enough in spiritual consciousness, the whole church will be led astray; there will not be the manifestation of the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[130]  If you do not know the activities of the Holy Spirit within you individually, there is no way for the Holy Spirit to get through in the church.
[131]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE SPIRITUAL FEELINGS Date:Evening, February 28, 1950
[132]  As the Holy Spirit moves within us and we touch the feeling of the Spirit, we exercise our mind to think and to translate this feeling in our spirit.
[133]  THE SPIRIT BEING THE ORGAN TO KNOW GOD'S WILL
[134]  The organ or faculty by which we know God's will is the spirit; it is by the sense of the spirit that we know God's will.
[135]  Only the spirit knows God and contacts God; the mind cannot know God.
[136]  If we only exercise our mind, we cannot touch or feel the Holy Spirit.
[137]  We can know the things of God because God gave us a new spirit when we were saved Ezek.
[138]  Some may ask about the function of the mind.
[139]  I am not saying that the mind is useless.
[140]  But even though our spirit feels it, our outer man does not know about it, and we have to interpret it with our mind so that we can understand the meaning of this move of God's Holy Spirit within us.
[141]  In our daily life we have to walk according to the leading of God's Spirit.
[142]  Our mind can help us in receiving guidance from the Holy Spirit; it can help us to make decisions in our daily life.
[143]  Suppose we are responsible for keeping the record of the saints in the church.
[144]  After we have selected the form, we have to decide when we will print it and when we will pass it out to the brothers and sisters.
[145]  If we need a form, yet do not have the right mind to design or choose one, our spirit will be bound because God's will is not being carried out.
[146]  In reading the Bible and listening to messages, we have to learn to exercise our spirit.
[147]  In our daily life, we have to ask ourselves continually, "Do I have the spirit when I am doing this?"
[148]  If all the brothers and sisters can learn and practice this lesson, our spiritual feeling will become very keen, and God will do great things in the church.
[149]  Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE CHURCH Spiritual Principles Operating in the Church
[150]  In order to carry out the visitation work in an orderly fashion, we have divided the visitation into a few smaller groups and asked a few brothers and sisters to take charge of them: 1 transportation of out-of-town visitors, 2 special visitations, 3 correspondence, 4 nursing mothers, and 5 love feasts.
[151]  On what basis then do we serve in the church?
[152]  The Lord has not left it to us to decide the method of making judgments in the church.
[153]  Later, after Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch from their first mission, they faced a great trial; some from the church in Jerusalem came to Antioch and taught that all believers had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses and that if they were not circumcised, they were not saved.
[154]  For this reason, the church can never mix salvation with things of the Jewish background, including circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and ordinances related to eating, etc. If such things were allowed to mix with salvation, other teachings would eventually come in. A man would be told that he could not be saved unless he did other things, such as obtain a university degree or practice vegetarianism, etc. In China, if the teaching of Confucius is allowed to come in, many will say that a man cannot be saved unless he honors his parents or practices universal compassion, etc. But this is not the gospel of Christ.
[155]  At that juncture Paul and Barnabas related all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them 15:12 .
[156]  When the whole church fellowships together, the brothers and sisters can express their opinion as much as they want.
[157]  But please remember that expressing your opinion does not mean that things will be done according to your way.
[158]  When the brothers and sisters speak, the elders must listen.
[159]  The elders have to learn to listen to the brothers and sisters.
[160]  AND THE GOSPEL OF THE CHURCH Date:Evening, March 2, 1950
[161]  Witness Lee: Individually or as the church, something is wrong when there is no fruit from our gospel preaching.
[162]  I said that if a young person would open his spirit to the Lord, he would surely receive the spirit of the gospel from God.
[163]  If we have a gospel spirit, the first thing we will have is "thick skin."
[164]  If we have a gospel spirit and see men walking away from salvation, how can we shut up and be ashamed of shouting when their soul is going to hell?
[165]  If we do not have these two traits, that is, if we will not give up our "face" and status, we will not have a strong gospel spirit.
[166]  When the church has a gospel move, everyone has to coordinate and work together as one man.
[167]  If the gospel meeting is conducted in the meeting hall, all the brothers and sisters have to do their best to invite people to come.
[168]  These gospel songs should be one-fourth of the content of a gospel meeting.
[169]  I am an outsider as far as music is concerned, but I can make a few comments because I have learned some lessons these years in preaching the gospel.
[170]  If we emphasize the music too much, we may lose the gospel spirit.
[171]  WHAT TO DO AFTER THE GOSPEL MEETING Taking Down Their Names
[172]  The end of the message is not the end of the story; there are still many things to do.
[173]  The schools and the occupations of all the brothers and sisters should be related to the gospel.
[174]  It is difficult to bring the gospel to a campus from outside.
[175]  In Taichung, Taiwan, one state-run agricultural school had only a few brothers and sisters.
[176]  A meeting hall that is properly decorated will incite the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and to serve Him.
[177]  The job itself may be very insignificant, but if it is done by us personally, we will take personal interest in it.
[178]  We feel that we are not worthy to be joined to You, but thank and praise You that through Your redemption and the shedding of Your blood, we have been joined to You.
[179]  If we have never thoroughly confessed our sins before the Lord, we cannot help the brothers and sisters whom we visit to experience this in a thorough and definite way.
[180]  First, in visiting others we should not have the thought that we are going to teach.
[181]  Isaiah 50 says we must have a tongue of a learner before we can strengthen the weak with our words v. 4 . We must learn to listen, to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit, and to look to Him for light before we can help others with a suitable word.
[182]  Hospitality can be considered a kind of visitation and shepherding.
[183]  It should not only arrange transportation for the visiting brothers and sisters but should provide hospitality for them as well.
[184]  They might not have known you, but as long as you were a brother or a sister, they would receive you freely.
[185]  The church in Shanghai is not that attentive to the needs of the brothers and sisters from North China and Manchuria.
[186]  When brothers and sisters go abroad or move to another locality, the church must not only write a letter of recommendation for them and inform the destination churches about them, but the church must appoint some saints to correspond with them.
[187]  If a brother or sister goes to a place that does not have a church, others should communicate with him and bring the church to him, thus taking care of his spiritual condition before the Lord.
[188]  The responsible brothers and sisters have to learn to have the heart of a nursing mother.
[189]  We know that women who have children of their own are more enlarged in their heart; they have a greater capacity for love.
[190]  We have to ask God to increase our capacity for love toward others.
[191]  The young brothers and sisters should learn not only to fellowship with their parents, but also with other parents.
[192]  We cannot advance to new lessons unless we have first finished the fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers.
[193]  For this reason we have to learn every one of these lessons thoroughly.
[194]  This does not mean that we have to know all fifty-two lessons and learn them all by heart within a year before we can graduate and teach others.
[195]  In our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we should only speak spiritual words and words of building; we should not help Satan multiply sin with our mouth.
[196]  Watchman Nee: First we need to ask if this kind of arrangement is scriptural.
[197]  Today we will consider the subject of the quality of the spirit.
[198]  A few days ago we spoke of the need to check our life, walk, and service, and consider whether or not the spirit was present in these activities and whether we sensed any spiritual feeling in doing these things.
[199]  Today I will say that in addition to paying attention to having the spirit, we have to pay attention to the quality of our spirit.
[200]  THE NEED OF A RIGHT SPIRIT TO SERVE THE LORD
[201]  Here we face a problem: What kind of spirit is a right spirit?
[202]  The above passage tells us that it is not enough to serve the Lord, love Him, and be zealous for Him.
[203]  We have to realize that a man is disapproved not because his conduct is wrong but because his spirit is wrong.
[204]  Witness Lee: I want to ask a few questions.
[205]  First, why must a servant of the Lord have a spirit?
[206]  Second, how do we differentiate between rightness of motive and rightness of spirit?
[207]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT 2 Date:March 9, 1950
[208]  Watchman Nee: Today we will pick up from where we left off yesterday.
[209]  A man's spirit carries his own taste and color.
[210]  When our spirit is released, it expresses the tastes and color of our very person.
[211]  In order to be right in our spirit, we have to go through dealings.
[212]  When a man is regenerated, the new spirit that God gives him is the same in quality as that which is given to any other person.
[213]  If a man does not have a pure spirit, he will find that his spirit is incompatible with the good words released from those with a pure spirit.
[214]  What is the result of having a sterling spirit?
[215]  If all the brothers and sisters in the church have a pure and noble spirit, they will mutually supply one another, and the church will be rich.
[216]  When my spirit opens up and the spirits of all the brothers and sisters open up, and when all of us touch God and serve Him in our spirit, we have the service of the whole church.
[217]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION
[218]  In the past I thought that God's salvation was to save me from hell and sin, but these are actually not the first items of God's salvation.
[219]  According to His plan and from His perspective, God's salvation primarily is not to deal with sin.
[220]  The Revelation in the Gospel of John Life Life Being in Christ
[221]  From Sinai we move forward for a thousand years to the New Testament.
[222]  The apostle John saw that life is in Christ John 1:4 .
[223]  Romans 8:28-30 shows that God causes all things to work together in order that His life would shine out of us.
[224]  They think that "all things work ing together for good to those who love God" means receiving blessing and peace, etc. For example, a man may try to catch a train but is delayed; he misses the train.
[225]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE SALVATION OF GOD 2 Date:Saturday evening, March 11, 1950
[226]  Although our concept may not be that low, we have to admit that our view of God's salvation is not as high as God's. If our understanding of God's salvation is according to the above description, we have taken God's salvation as a crutch to solve only our problem of sin.
[227]  He deals with unclean thoughts, transgressions with the tongue, jealousy, pride, etc. But if we were completely delivered from sin today, would we still need God's salvation? Perhaps we think that we are justified before God as long as we have the right view and live a righteous, pure, and virtuous life, not losing our temper or casting evil eyes on others.
[228]  Even if we can be like Job, fearing God and eschewing evil, and even if Satan cannot accuse us, is this all God's salvation will do in us?
[229]  Let me ask again: What is the difference between law and grace?
[230]  The law is something from God and yet apart from God.
[231]  Watchman Nee: If Adam had not sinned, would God have reached His goal?
