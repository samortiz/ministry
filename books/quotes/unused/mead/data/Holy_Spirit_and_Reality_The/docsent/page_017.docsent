   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASONS FOR OBSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are always reasons for Christians to be obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must now find a few basic reasons for obsession from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Love of Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One great reason for obsession is the fact that men love darkness and do not love light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a man does not prefer light but prefers darkness, there is bias in his heart, and it becomes easy for him to be obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A man may try at first to avoid difficulties, troubles, and the light by saying that he is right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the end, he begins to believe that he is right and good, and he becomes obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Israelites rejected the Lord Jesus because they loved the darkness rather than the light John 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not have the light, and they dwelt in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they considered it justified to reject and hate the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord said, "If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father" 15:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because they were obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They hated the Lord Jesus without cause v. 25 . We must realize that wherever there is darkness and wherever there is a lack of light, there is a wrong view, wrong confidence, wrong self-trust, and wrong judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything that is wrong has the element of obsession in it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result of not loving the light is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pride</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Pride is another great reason for obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Obadiah 3 says, "The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows us that another reason for self-deception is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are self-deceived to the point of obsession are probably proud ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian may start out with the intention of gaining vainglory and position before men, and then may begin to pretend and deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gradually, he begins to deceive himself, and he becomes obsessed in the end. Once a Christian becomes proud, it is easy for him to fantasize that he has something, that he possesses something, and gradually he will regard his fantasy as reality; the result is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that pride is a small sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Pride can easily lead to obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we have to learn to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not Receiving the Love of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another great reason for obsession is not receiving the love of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Thessalonians 2:10-11 tells us that God sends to those who "did not receive the love of the truth an operation of error that they might believe the lie."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a terrible end. When a man believes in lies, the result is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To believe in lies is to believe that there is something when there is actually nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a man does not receive the love of the truth, surely he believes in lies, and when he believes in lies, he is obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth, and sell it not; / also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Truth is something that we have to buy, something that requires a price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We would be blessed if our hearts were ready to love and receive only God's truth at any price.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But men often do not have a heart to receive the love of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, they twist the truth and annul the truth; they hope that this and that are not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They end up believing that this and that are not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They make the truth untruth and the untruth truth, and they appear to be very confident about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is being obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must realize that if a man does not receive the love of the truth once, it will be difficult for him to see the truth later.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brother who studied in a seminary once went to a theological professor to ask about the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The brother said, "I saw before the Lord that I have been crucified with Christ, that I have died, and that I should be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I ought to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What would you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The professor said, "I had a similar experience when I was in the seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was about to graduate, and I saw that I was dead and that I ought to be buried and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if I had been baptized, I would no longer have been able to work in my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I prayed and felt that I would wait until I graduated and was a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many years have passed since I graduated and became a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am still not baptized, and everything still seems okay.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should concentrate on your study.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After you graduate, you will be a pastor and such questions will not bother you anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Disobeying the truth and thinking that one can live in peace is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fortunately, the brother did not follow the professor's advice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, when our hearts are not absolute, it will be easy for us to be obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not Seeking the Glory That Is from the Only God</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another reason for obsession is not seeking the glory that is from the only God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus said, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This shows us that the Israelites rejected the Lord and lost eternal life by seeking for another kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How pitiful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Israelites' lust for glory turned their hearts towards lies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result they believed the lies, began to think highly of themselves, and were obsessed.</S>
