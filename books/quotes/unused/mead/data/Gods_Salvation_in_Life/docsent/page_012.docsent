   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE DEFINITION OF TRANSFORMATION A. Not Merely a Perceptible Change Outwardly in Behavior</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our transformation in the life of God is not merely a perceptible change outwardly in behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a person is saved, he might think that he was a mess as a non-Christian, but now that he is going to church and is also carrying a Bible, he should change his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians change their behavior this way, and their relatives praise them, saying, "It is good to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>See, my child has changed since he believed in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact is that inwardly he has not changed; he has changed only outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If after you believe in the Lord Jesus there is a change only in your outward condition, then this change is merely an outward, perceived change in behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not to be saved in God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I lived in China when I was young, and I observed many disciples of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes their improvement in behavior was quite remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the difference between the behavioral improvement of Confucius' disciples and the transformation of Jesus' believers?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I heard some missionaries, who were not clear concerning the truth, say that the teachings of the Bible are exactly the same as the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They did not realize that what the teachings of Confucius produced, at most, was an improvement in behavior and not a transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Being a Metabolic Transformation Inwardly in Essence</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Transformation is not merely a noticeable change outwardly in behavior; rather, it is a metabolic transformation inwardly in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse, the word changed is not used.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament the word transformed is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It occurs once in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and another time in Romans 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This term denotes an inward, metabolic change and not an outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the difference between change and transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may use the example of a person who has been ill and looks thin and pale.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of this she puts cosmetics on her face to try to improve her appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After applying some powder and lipstick, she has some color and looks nice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not transformation but is altogether an outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is just like a Chinese opera singer who may turn his face into a white face, a black face, or a red face.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, whether white, black, or red, it is not transformation; it is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a person to be transformed means that after he is sick, he nourishes himself properly; then after two months when people see him, they will say that he has good color and looks nice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That kind of healthy look is not something added outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a manifestation of an inward physical metabolic transformation in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE STEPS OF TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants us to be transformed, but we cannot transform ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are steps in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we follow these steps, we will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. Washing the Washing of Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first step of transformation is that God has washed us, but this washing is not an outward washing by water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This washing is the washing of regeneration referred to in Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we receive God into us as our life and we are thus regenerated, that is a great washing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the time of our regeneration, we repented, condemned ourselves, and confessed our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, we confessed that we were sinners who deserve to die and that we were indeed dead and ought to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we needed to be baptized in water to declare that we died and have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason that after we have believed, we must be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be baptized is to be buried; our old man, our dirty man, our dead man, needs to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This burial is a big washing that buries our old man and our old history in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have been saved and also baptized into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been regenerated, and now we have God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our old man was also buried through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus said, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be born of water is to confess that we are sinners who are condemned, who suffered the penalty of death, and who are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we now let the baptizing one bury our old man in baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, regeneration is a washing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This matter is clearly mentioned in Romans 6.</S>
