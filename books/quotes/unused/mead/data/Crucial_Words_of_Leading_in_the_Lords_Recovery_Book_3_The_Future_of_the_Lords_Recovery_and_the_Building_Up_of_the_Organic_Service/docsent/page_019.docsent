   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Reformation and the State Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since A.D. 570, after the papal system was established, Roman Catholics have followed the orders of the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the sixteenth century Martin Luther rose up to make reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first point he advocated was that believers did not need to obey the pope in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Martin Luther had no intention of coming out of the Catholic Church; he merely wanted to resolve the matter of absolute obedience to the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He never intended to leave the church; his only thought was to introduce changes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had no intention of overthrowing the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He advocated obedience to the Bible, not the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luther s view incited a number of disputes and even started a war.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In those days there were numerous small German states, and some of the heads of these states were dissatisfied with the pope s oppression and wanted an excuse to escape from papal interference.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they united to protect Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was with this action that breaking away from the Catholic Church began.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, a group of people came out of the Catholic Church, but they fell into the hands of the state churches that were established in Germany and a number of other countries in northern Europe, such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even today people in Germany pay a church tax, which the government gives to the state church for its use.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The state church in Germany, as well as most other state churches, is Lutheran.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Chinese we call these churches The Justification-by-faith Church because Luther was the first person to advocate justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the state church of England is not Lutheran.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The state church of England is the Anglican Church; it is also called the Episcopal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Episcopal means of the bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Episcopal Church of England is a system of bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the word bishop means overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Episcopal Church inherited the practice of a system of bishops from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The practice of a system of bishops, which is a product of the clergy-laity system, is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible clearly says that those who oversee are elders; thus, elders are overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 20:28 Paul spoke with the elders in Ephesus and said to them, The Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This proves that elders are overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the apostles there was a group of Bible teachers who are referred to as the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The term church fathers is not appropriate, because the Lord Jesus clearly said, Do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens Matt 23:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ignatius, who was a Bible teacher in the second century and is considered one of the church fathers, made a great mistake when he spoke of the elders and the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ignatius taught that an elder governs one locality, but an overseer, a bishop, governs a region.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, an overseer is considered higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This teaching produced a religious hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eighteen centuries have passed since then.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During this time a religious hierarchy, or the clergy system, was developed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Roman Catholic Church, the priests are on the lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A priest can rise to become a bishop, a bishop can become an archbishop, and an archbishop can become a cardinal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cardinals serve as the pope s cabinet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Catholic Church has more than one hundred cardinals around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the pope dies, the cardinals vote and elect the next pope from among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The system of the pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests is a religious hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of all the religious groups in the world today, the organization of the Roman Catholic Church is the strongest and the strictest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Luther left the Roman Catholic Church, he was leaving religious hierarchy, but he fell into the organization of the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The head of every state church is the king of that country.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, if you are a member of the Anglican Church, you are a subject of the Queen of England.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every member of the Anglican Church is subordinate to the Queen of England because the Queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, every native-born Englishman has two statuses: he is a citizen of England and a member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the organization of the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Private Churches and</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>the Recovery with the Brethren</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After the formation of the state churches, in approximately 1500, some private churches were raised up in the regions of central Europe and Germany, based on practices such as the presbytery and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These believers were severely persecuted because they rejected the Catholic Church and the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time central Europe was under the control of the Catholic Church, and northern Europe was under the influence of the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Puritans were also raised up, and were forced to wander from place to place because of the persecution they faced.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Between 1720 and 1730 in a place called Saxony, in today s Germany, there was a brother by the name of Zinzendorf, who was a count and who had a large estate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He also loved the Lord; his beliefs were pure, and most of his practices were according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Groups of persecuted believers gradually found their way to his property, and they began meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The largest group came from Moravia by way of Bohemia.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the believers who met with Zinzendorf were called the Moravian Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The believers with Zinzendorf returned to much of the truths in the Bible, and they met according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, they were very good in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John Wesley was raised up at about the same time as Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Wesley preached the gospel throughout England and was a famous revivalist.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After another one hundred years, in about 1820, the British Brethren were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their knowledge of the truth surpassed Zinzendorf s, and they received clear light regarding the general practices of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are standing on their shoulders with regard to the deep and profound revelations of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, because they paid too much attention to doctrines and fell into dead letters, they divided into many different sects.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Brethren Assembly has been divided into more than one thousand different sects.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through these divisions, they lost the Lord s testimony and His presence.</S>
