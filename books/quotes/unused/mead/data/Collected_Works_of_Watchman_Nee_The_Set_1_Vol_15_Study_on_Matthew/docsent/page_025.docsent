   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning verse 2, Spurgeon said that if someone is a leper yet he does not come to worship the Lord, his leprosy must be very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Mark 9:22-23, the man said, "If you can...."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was a questioning of the Lord's power, and that is why the Lord rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here, the leper said, "Lord, if You are willing."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a matter of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The leper did not doubt the Lord; he just did not know whether or not the Lord was willing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said, "I am willing," meaning "I am definitely willing."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we can see the Lord's heart toward the sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 4: "Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because at that time the law had not been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only through the death of the Lord can we be freed from the requirements of the law, as shown in Romans 7:4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time the Lord had not yet died; therefore, they had to follow the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 5-10: Fever is an abnormal power; paralysis is an abnormal weakness; and leprosy is an abnormal filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have great faith is to believe in God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's authority and God's word go together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, "God said, Let there be light: and there was light."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God created the heavens and the earth by His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word for power literally means "dynamite."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for authority denotes a very marvelous power that can subdue everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People today pay attention to power but do not care for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men commit sin because they overthrow the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the time of the great tribulation, all the people in the world will try to use their power to overthrow God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan is what he is because he wants to overthrow the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only will he not submit himself to the authority of God; he also stirs people up to oppose God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, Christ withstood Satan with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sharp sword coming out of the Lord's mouth is the power behind His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not use power to directly rule over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Christians today should learn to submit themselves under the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verses 11-13: When the Lord mentioned the kingdom of the heavens, He did not specify whether it is in the present or in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some say it refers to the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If so, then verse 11 cannot be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in chapter eleven, verses 11-12, it seems that the kingdom of the heavens is in the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 5:3 it is in the future because it is related to reward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The kingdom of God" is mentioned five times in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's kingdom is God's sovereign authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There must be a difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens; otherwise, the Lord would not have used a different term.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom of God is both today and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way to explain the question is to first look for the facts, the phenomena, and then look for the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The major sections: 1 Chapters one through four are the first major section.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2 Chapters five through seven are the second major section.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3 Chapters eight through nine are the third major section.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The minor sections: 8:1-17 is divided into four small sections: 1 verses 2-4, the cleansing of the leper; 2 verses 5-13, the healing of the paralytic servant; 3 verses 14-15, the healing of the fever of Peter's mother-in-law; and 4 verses 16-17, the healing of many who were ill.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The four titles of the Lord on the earth as the Son are: 1 the Son of God, 2 the Son of Man, 3 the Son of Abraham, and 4 the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the four small sections in chapter eight we see the Lord as the Son in four ways: 1 In the cleansing of the leper He is the Son of God this is in relation to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 In the healing of the paralytic, He is the Son of Abraham this is because of faith and because it is in relation to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 In the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, He is the Son of David this is in relation to the Jews in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>4 In the casting out of demons and in the healing of all men, He is the Son of Man this is in relation to all people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 14: "And Jesus, coming into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word "house" is one of the key words in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Bible this word has its special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same word is used in Matthew 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Matthew's record, the magi saw the Lord in the house; in Luke's record, the Lord was found in the manger by the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord healed the leper in the open air, not in a house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Coming into the house is an indication of intimate communication.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here it shows that there were only a few Jews who received salvation at the Lord's first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord came to Peter's house to heal Peter's mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A house is a place of intimacy and affection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that all the Jews will be saved in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord healed both the leper and Peter's mother-in-law by touching them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that the Lord has a special relationship with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verses 16 and 17 show what the Lord will do in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Matthew recorded the events in this way because the order in this book is according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 15: "And He touched her hand, and the fever left her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And she arose and served Him."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's touch is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once He touches us, His power contacts our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Wherever the Lord touches, Satan has no more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 16: "And when evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"Many" here means a great many, a multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here the Lord cast out demons "with a word"; this is a reflection of the case where the Lord healed the paralytic by speaking a word, as seen in the second small section.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This shows that the Lord is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Brought to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is to stand in a position where one can receive the blessing of the Lord.</S>
