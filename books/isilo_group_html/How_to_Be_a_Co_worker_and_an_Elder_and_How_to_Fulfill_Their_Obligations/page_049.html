In this building, in the middle of this city, a river of water of life flows out for us to drink and in the river the tree of life grows for us to eat. What we drink and what we eat are the Spirit and Christ, that is, the Triune God. The Spirit is the flowing of the Triune God; Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. If I eat and drink the Triune God, I am sustained; I have gold, pearl, and precious stones. If I do not eat God or drink the Lord, I do not have gold, pearl, and precious stones; I have only wood, grass, and stubble. This does not mean that only our losing our temper is considered wood, grass, and stubble. Actually, our meekness and even our diligent service may not be the Triune God but wood, grass, and stubble.</P><P>In the past there was a large frame in my study in which these words were written: "...he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire" (1 Cor. 3:15). If you build the temple of God with gold, silver, and precious stones, you will receive a reward. However, if you build with wood, grass, and stubble, your work will be consumed, but you yourself will be saved, yet so as through fire. This may be likened to a piece of land that was on fire, and the wood, grass, and stubble upon it were burned. The land itself could not be consumed, yet it went through the burning by fire. I hung that portion of 1Corinthians on the wall in my home so that I might always be reminded: "Man, be careful; do not try to build the Body of Christ and the New Jerusalem with your nature, disposition, old 'I,' old creation, self, inclination, and preference. If you do, you will destroy the Body of Christ." Whenever we touch the eternal goal of God, the New Jerusalem, we need to be very pure; we must not be careless.</P><P>In summary, this message tells us that we need to work with God to carry out His divine building in three aspects&#151;the church, the Body, and the holy city. God's building is first an assembly as the church, then a Body, and finally a city. Strictly speaking, the New Jerusalem is consummated not only by being built but also by being adorned with pure gold as its base, pearl as its gates, and precious stones for its wall. This is God's eternal dwelling place, His eternal enlargement, expansion, and expression.</P><P>I hope that you will learn to memorize, recite, and speak these messages. When I was learning of Brother Nee, I never had any gimmicks. I only spoke the way he spoke, and I even used the same expressions that he used. Later, others criticized me, saying that I spoke the same things that Brother Nee did, and that even my gestures in speaking were the same as Brother Nee's. Once a certain pastor ridiculed me, saying, "You know only to imitate Brother Nee's speaking; whatever he speaks, you speak." I said, "That is my glory." Within me I said, "To be frank, even if you try to imitate him, you may not make it." To be able to imitate is blessed; to be able to recite is blessed. Do not try to invent new words yourself. I hope that we all can enter into the reality of these messages.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
