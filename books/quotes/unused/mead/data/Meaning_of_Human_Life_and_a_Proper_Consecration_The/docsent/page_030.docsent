   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must ask the Lord to fill every part of our being for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord is pure, holy, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When He says that we are wrong in a certain matter, we should confess that matter and ask Him to forgive us, cleanse us, and cover us with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we fellowship with Him in this way, our relationship with Him becomes transparent, peaceful, and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are able to sense His presence and live in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the Lord will be our person, and we will be able to follow Him in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It may seem that there is a price to pay in following the Lord s leading, but there is actually no price to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever He leads, we can simply follow, and however He moves in us, we can simply say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the way to receive the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we live a life of following the Lord, the people whom we contact with the gospel will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may not be aware of it, but those whom we contact will be subdued by the power of the gospel and will believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will feel compelled to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Believing in Jesus is something wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes a person may not be convinced in his mind, but he feels compelled to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the Lord s Spirit has reached him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christians always try to persuade others to believe in Jesus; however, it is very easy for people to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once a person believes, it is impossible for him to disbelieve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is something in every genuine Christian that cannot be shaken, chased away, or beaten down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When some saints encounter difficulties, they say that they no longer believe in the Lord; however, eventually faith within them rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Lord s grace; this is the Lord s Spirit reaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, it does not matter whether we subdue people by our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What matters is that we are connected to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then when we contact a person, the Lord s Spirit will reach him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outwardly he may feel that our speaking does not make sense, but inwardly he will sense the preciousness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the Lord s grace; this is the Spirit s confirming our speaking and reaching him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must always be living and connected to the Lord so that our gospel preaching will also be living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then there will be something like electricity that flows from us to our gospel contact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will be like electrical wires that convey electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever a person touches us, he will immediately be electrified and believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is the Spirit who flows through us into whomever we preach the gospel to.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the power of the Holy Spirit that transcends human knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as we are unable to explain electricity, we are unable to clearly explain the power of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, our Lord is more real than electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our experience of Him depends on our allowing Him to flow through us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>MEETING WITH NEW BELIEVERS BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a young saint brings a classmate to salvation, he should begin meeting with the new one immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need formality, nor should we expect others to lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The young saint and his classmate should meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can meet at noon for half an hour or after school for half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such informal meetings should begin as soon as someone has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When another classmate believes in the Lord, there will be two meetings, and when three classmates have believed, there will be three meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The meetings do not have to be held in a classroom; the meetings can be on the lawn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First pray with the new one, and then read a portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can teach new ones how to pray-read and pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord s Spirit will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must not take the old way of Christianity to rely on pastors and preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither should we depend on the responsible brothers or co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should depend on our spirit and on the operating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our meetings with the new ones are good, three believers will become four, four believers will become five, and five believers will become six; our number will continue to multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are willing to take this way, the Lord will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In such meetings the words in the Bible will be bright and clear, full of anointing, watering, and very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only so, our temperaments and problems will spontaneously fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever our relationship with the Lord is normal, all our problems leave us, we become bright and clear within, and it is difficult for Satan to touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Gradually, we can bring our classmates to the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should also fellowship with the other brothers and sisters in our school in order to help one another bring our classmates into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should also establish contact and fellowship between our saved classmates and the saints in the church as well as the other brothers and sisters in our school.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, the new ones will be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we all have this kind of practice, we will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there are two thousand brothers and sisters in a school, that is two thousand little speakers, who are more effective than one preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE EFFECT OF THE GOSPEL BEING CONTINUAL</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, the parents of the young people whom we gain will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When young people graduate from high school and enter college, it is very easy for them to lead their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not easy for the children to listen to their parents, but it is rather easy for the parents to receive what their children say.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When young people hear the gospel in school, they will tell their parents what they heard, and it will be easy for the parents to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Gaining a classmate is equivalent to gaining a family.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a continual cycle, and the effect is also continual.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From this day onward the work with the young people should be carried out by the young saints.</S>
