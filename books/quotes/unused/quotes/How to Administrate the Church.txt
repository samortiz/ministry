These two verses show that the pillar and base of the truth is the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh
Verse 22 continues, 'And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
The responsible brothers in many local churches are very concerned about the matter of how to administrate the church
We must have a fundamental understanding, because only then can we know what it means to administrate the church and how to administrate it
We often see someone administrating the church in a faithful way, and we may not even sense an improper spirit in him
He administrates the church, but he does not know the church, the nature of the church, or the origin of the church
Before the Lord comes back, we must know how to administrate the church and how to conduct ourselves in the church
The church is not an organization, a company, a school, a factory, or a hospital; rather, the church is a house-the house of God
Concerning the function of a family, everyone in a proper family, whether children or parents, all have some understanding
Some people may say, 'This is the definition of a house according to symbolic meaning, but is there a scriptural basis for this'?
As long as something is living, whether it is an animal or a plant, it surely will produce offspring and bear fruit
Our God is not the God of the dead but the God of the living; hence, in His house He wants to propagate His life
If we must keep quiet and are not allowed to speak a word in our home, then our home is just like a court of law
The church as the house of God is for the continuation of God's life, the expression and manifestation of God, and the rest of God
When the brothers and sisters sat there, they were all like legislators, and they did not give any room for God to express Himself
In all of the ways that we conduct ourselves, we must firmly grasp the principle that the church is the house of God
According to 1 Timothy 3:15, the house of God is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
We know that this truth has become flesh, because verse 17 says, 'Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ'
Our spirit and soul are the reality of our body as a shell; if our spirit and soul leave, our body becomes a sham
The church is the pillar and base of God being manifested in the flesh, and this matter needs to be upheld by the church
When we come to 1 Timothy, however, we see that the church becomes the base of God's manifestation in the flesh
With regard to the truth of God being manifested in the flesh, the church is not only the pillar but also the base
The more we have God's likeness in our living, the more we are like God; the more we live like God, the more godly we are
If we have the mystery of God being manifested in the flesh and of men of flesh being joined to God then we as men of flesh can be like God
If we tell people that we have God in us, they may say that we are crazy, because this matter is truly too great a mystery
Outwardly speaking He was a Jew who grew up in Nazareth but inwardly there was a story that was not yet manifestedthere was still a mystery
After He was resurrected and ascended, He, as the Holy Spirit, entered into us, and thus we also became part of the mystery
When we preach the gospel, we testify to people that we have a treasure in us which even the noblest man in the world cannot obtain
When people see our children, they more or less can tell whose children they are, because our children somewhat look like us
If all three children were here, we could distinguish between his biological child and his adopted children simply by looking at them
In this house we can see God, not an individual God but God who is in His children, that is, in many men of the flesh
The church is not a meeting hall; the church is God manifested in the flesh, the house of God, the place where God's life is propagated
1 Timothy 316 says Justified in the Spirit Seen by angels Preached among the nations Believed on in the world Taken up in glory
Christ is the individual manifestation of God in the flesh, and the church is the corporate manifestation of God in the flesh
If the power of our gospel preaching was a replacement of Christ, then when Christ is manifested among us, the replacement will fade away
When we are telling people to believe in Christ, the church in reality is also telling people to believe in the church
In Acts, those who preached the gospel, who preached Christ, were Christ; even the churches that preached Christ were Christ
In Acts the twelve apostles, the one hundred twenty, and Stephen were preaching Christ, but they were also Christ
When Saul was persecuting Stephen and other Christians he was persecuting Me when Saul was persecuting the church he was persecuting Me
The church is justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and taken up in glory
We must see this so that we will know how we ought to conduct ourselves in the church if the Lord delays His coming
In addition to these two portions, it is difficult to find another that speaks of the church in such a high and deep way
Christ came out of death through the power of resurrection; the issue of His resurrection is the producing of the church
Resurrection is the release of the infinite life of God from the shell of the created humanity which Christ entered
When He was incarnated, He entered into a created shell, and the unlimited life in Him was restricted in this created shell
The Lord Jesus entered into death so that through death, the unlimited and infinite life in Him could come out from His created shell
Death delivers man from everything of the old creation, and resurrection ushers man into God's new creation, into God's life
All of the old creation, which is natural, defiled, and fallen, has been thoroughly dealt with by Christ's death
In Matthew 6:10 the Lord Jesus taught His disciples to pray: 'Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth'
In the Bible, from Genesis 3 onward, any reference to the earth implies that the earth is under the authority of Satan and belongs to him
Leviticus says that swarming locusts and swallowing locusts are clean, because they can fly and go above the earth
After man fell through Satan's temptation, from God's perspective the earth was altogether trampled by Satan and possessed by him
God cursed the serpent so that it would not walk with legs but would go upon its stomach and eat dust all the days of its life
Although the church is on earth, her nature is not earthly but heavenly, because she was produced by the One who is in heaven
Through the Lord's ascension, He surpassed the power of the darkness of the rulers and authorities on earth and in the air
Christ's ascension causes the church not only to transcend the limitations of time and space but also to transcend time and space itself
When Christ ascended to the heavenlies, not only was He far above Satan, time, and space, but also all things were subjected under His feet
The church was produced because Christ is not only above all things but also because all things have been put under His feet
His conclusion consists of two points: the church is 'the Body of Christ' and 'the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
The manifestation of God in the flesh is the 'great mystery of godliness,' which causes the church to be mingled with Christ as one
According to Ephesians 1, we see that the church is the Body of Christ and the fullness of the One who fills all in all
The church is not under all things but above all things and experiences being the head over all things with Christ
In the church everything must be according to His will, and we must reject anything that is not according to His will
When we handle a matter in the church, we should pray, 'O God, what should we do to be according to Your will?
What is according to God's will can be determined by the four items of what the church is and the six characteristics of the church
Sometimes the saints see the church only as a school for education rather than for the propagation of God's life
All of our actions, decisions, and administration in the church must be governed by our knowledge of the church
So far they have received less than 12,500 dollars from offerings, even though the transaction of the land has been closed for a few months
Since the offerings received by the church were not sufficient, funds from other sources have been temporarily advanced to the church
We must see before the Lord what the church is, and then, when we take any action in the church, we will be standing on the proper ground
The church is the house of God, the pillar and base of the truth, the Body of Christ, and the fullness of the One who fills all in all
We can do many legal and proper things in the world, but we cannot do them in the church because the church is different in her nature
When we speak of the arrangement for the service and material furnishings, every meeting hall competes with the others
There is no such thing as the church that belongs to Keelung, to Kaohsiung, to Taipei hall one, or to Taipei hall two
From the time Christianity came to China, no one ever used the term prayer and fellowship meeting; we were the first
If the Lord sees that it is good and fitting for them to do this, what can slaves, who are nothing but dust, say?
We are here not to build up any so-called church assembly hall, because we know that the church transcends time and space
Whether the church is the church has nothing to do with having a meeting hall or even having a successful work
If we speak in this way in the church life, we will immediately bring the church into subjection to gold, to mammon
If we want to administrate the church, lead the church, and know how to conduct the affairs of the church, we must see what the church is
Since Christ is Head over all things to the church, how can He not cause all things to work together for good to the church?
When we know the church, we will know how to administrate the church, lead the church, and conduct the affairs of the church
The things we do must be related to not being disobedient to the heavenly vision that we have seen in regard to the church
If we want to know how to administrate the church and serve in the church, we must have a thorough knowledge of this portion
Whenever we do anything, we all have some natural concepts concerning how to proceed and how things should be done
At the same time, we need to enter into God's Word and see how to administrate the church and serve in the church
In this portion Paul speaks of how Christ produced the church and gave gifts to the church after His resurrection and ascension
In order for the ascended Lord to produce and build up the church on the earth, however, He still needs a group of people who are gifts
After ascending to heaven and sitting on the throne of glory, the Lord, who died and resurrected, produced the church
The Head in heaven did not produce the church directly but rather through the twelve apostles on the earth and the one hundred twenty
On one hand, the church was produced by the Head; on the other hand, the church was produced indirectly by the Head
They do not think that it refers to the gifts perfecting the saints so that each one of the saints may do the work of ministry
According to this portion in the Bible, the Lord's workers should not replace the saints in the church service
Rather, His intention is for the gifts to work in the church to the extent that all the saints in the church can rise up to serve
The gifts should not replace the saints but rather perfect the saints so that each one can carry out his function
In the end, some saints may become elders and some may become deacons as a part of the perfecting work carried out by the gifts
The gifts are joined together in coordination to perfect the saints so that each saint can do the work of the ministry
The result of the work of the gifts may be considered indirect; the result of the saints who have been perfected is direct
As far as the building of the Body of Christ is concerned, the work of the gifts is indirect, but the work of the saints is direct
All the elders and deacons should serve God directly; they should not serve in a way that they are replaced by others
The co-workers are sent by God to do the perfecting work so that the saints will be enabled and willing to serve
All those who are blessed and who stand in the position of workers must see that they cannot replace the saints in serving God
The elders and deacons should not think that their burdens can be unloaded onto the co-workers who come into their midst
We need to be clear that those who directly serve the church are the saints in the church, including the elders and deacons
The co-workers are commissioned only to perfect the elders, deacons, and saints so that they may rise up and serve
If we are elders or deacons we should never expect any workers to replace us in the service rather we must be perfected to rise up and serve
Ephesians 4:13 says, 'Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God,
Another brother may say that since the Bible refers to the Lord's Day, the believers in the New Testament should meet on the Lord's Day
The gifts also all need to arrive at the oneness of the full knowledge of the Son of God; then we will arrive at a full-grown man
If the light we receive stays merely on the surface of the truth, we will have no way to arrive at the oneness of the faith
If we truly know the Son of God inwardly, whether we keep the Lord's Day or the Sabbath Day will not matter to us
The Jews asked the Lord Jesus about the matter of profaning the Sabbath, and the Lord replied, 'The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath'
Ephesians 4:13 continues, saying, 'At a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'
Some supported the thought of being raptured before the tribulation and others supported the thought of being raptured after the tribulation
Originally there were about fifty to sixty people in their meeting, but toward the end of their time of arguing, less than ten were meeting
If we know and experience the Son of God, the matter of the prophecy regarding the rapture will not matter to us
The oneness of the faith among the saints does not depend on the rapture; rather, it depends on the Son of God, Christ
The more we see the Son of God, the more we will be clear as to whether or not we need to be baptized by immersion
In this way, we will arrive at a full-grown man experientially, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
We must firmly grasp one thing, that is, we must take the knowledge of the Son of God as the center in our service to God
If a brother who holds a view that baptism by immersion is unnecessary and that baptism by sprinkling is good enough, what should we do?
All opinions and debates are an outward cloak; the real issue is that we do not have an adequate knowledge of the Son of God
If a sister maintains that she does not need to cover her head, we should never argue with her, because it is useless
If this is the case, the Christ in us will be the way, the means, and the principle in our administration of the church
We must lead them to know the Son of God; this is where we find the reality of the church, the content of the church
The apostle Paul said, 'Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God'
Some of the Corinthians were focused on signs, and some on wisdom , yet Paul said, 'But we preach Christ crucified'
When we carry out the work of the ministry in our service in the church, the stature of Christ, which is Christ Himself, will increase
Ephesians 4:13 says, 'Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God,
Paul first speaks of the knowledge of the Son of God, and then he speaks of the measure of the stature of Christ, not of the Son of God
The One we know is the Son of God, the life of God, and in the end we grow up unto the measure of the stature of Christ
Son of God emphasizes the fact that God's life has entered into us; Christ refers to the fact that we have God's work on us
We need to have the realization in the Holy Spirit that the Son of God always denotes God's life, and Christ denotes God's work
Since the Son of God denotes God's life, it denotes God's nature; since Christ denotes God's work, it denotes God's plan
In the church God wants the saints to grow up unto the measure of the stature of Christ by knowing the Son of God
In other words, the saints have God's life and nature within them as a result of the accomplished work of Christ upon them
Through our service and fellowship, he should realize that he has the life and nature of the Son of God within him
When we speak of the Son of God, we touch God's life and God's nature; God's life and nature are in the Son of God
Our service in the church is to lead the brothers and sisters to touch God's life and nature and thereby allow God's plan to work in them
If we preach the Bible with the teachings of Confucius and Mencius can we cause people to know the Son of God or have the increase of Christ
We can cause people to know the Son of God only when our preaching and our utterance and eloquence are the Son of God
One message may differ from another message, and not every message can cause the element of Christ to increase in people
Those who fellowship with Christ and allow Christ to live in them surely will respect, love, and be considerate of their wives
The love with which husbands love their wives is Christ; a parent's love, teaching, and care for their children should also be Christ
If everything is filled with Christ, then whether we are speaking about filial piety, love, or submission, others can gain Christ
It is only when we take the Son of God as the material that we can cause others to know the Son of God and to gain the Son of God
To speak of taking Christ as the material is easy, but taking Christ as the material requires experience in practice
Someone may ask, 'Why do some co-workers teach people not to wear fashionable clothing, put on lipstick, or go to the movies'?
We cannot wear fashionable clothing because Christ is in us; we cannot go to the movies because Christ is in us
If it does not come from Christ, it does not make any difference whether we wear a fancy dress or a plain dress
Every message should be centered on Christ; every exhortation must be joined to Christ and take Christ as the foundation
Carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error'
There are some brothers and sisters who spoke such nonsensical words four or five years ago who still speak such words
The essence and content of all the teachings in the Bible including honoring parents loving wives or submitting to husbands are just Christ
Today there are countless winds of teaching coming from the pulpits of Christianity, carrying people away from Christ
No matter what we preach, we should take Christ as the center and remain with Christ, taking Him as the essence and content
Even if our preaching is on matters related to our daily living, such as how to dress properly, it still must be according to Christ
Every message regardless of its topic should cause people to desire Christ and desire to submit to Christ thereby bringing them into Christ
It would be better if people did not listen to the message, because they were closer to Christ before hearing the message
The full-grown men in Ephesians 4:13 do not listen to winds of teaching, because they are aware of this deception
Because of their knowledge of the Son of God, they are full-grown men and have the measure of the stature of Christ
The winds of teaching are in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error ; hence, it is a system of error
If someone among us teaches us not to honor our parents, we surely would not listen to him because we are convinced that that is from Satan
If we deviate from Christ after hearing an appealing message concerning honoring our parents, this is still the craftiness of Satan
Many brothers may not want to carry people away and are not purposely doing this, but in the end they still do it
After considering for many days and after much prayer, he feels that he should avoid the subject of Christ being our life
He considers a topic but rejects it as not being attractive, and he considers another topic, but rejects it as uninspiring
Message after message are only winds of teaching that blow the brothers and sisters in one direction and then in another direction
After being blown for many years, they still do not know Christ or know how to live in Christ, and Christ's life in them has not increased
The enemy tries to use these schemes to systematically annul the work of the Holy Spirit to enable people to know the Son of God
If we are not careful, we will be unconsciously deceived by the evil one and carry people away by the messages we speak
We should take only the Son of God-Christ-as the material; then we will be able to generate and produce Christ
When we have the experience of Christ in all things, we will be able to dispense Him and bring Him to others in our daily living
We need to pay attention to the full knowledge of the Son of God and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in the church
In Ephesians 4:14 many distracting things are present, including Satan's craftiness, Satan's sleights, and Satan's system
We should not consider the expressions in verse 14, including sleight, craftiness, and system of error, in a light way
Only when we spend time to study these verses will we understand the meaning that the Holy Spirit intends to convey
We must understand that winds of teaching have been greatly utilized by Satan in the church; this is a serious matter
Verse 14 shows that the crafty one, Satan, brings man into a system of error by craftiness and sleight through the winds of teaching
We must confess that this is not out of man's imagination or preference; instead, this is the Spirit's motivation among us
These messages are winds of teaching raised up by the sleight of Satan, which carry the saints away from Christ
Today many people take a verse or a portion from the Bible and give message after message, but they have not taken the Bible as the content
Any preaching of the word that is genuinely from the Bible must take Christ as the center and the Son of God as the content
Otherwise, thousands of messages which claim to be scriptural will not be scriptural but in fact will be winds of teaching
Appealing messages in Christianity often are produced by Satan after a long period of consideration in order to fulfill his purpose
If this is not the case, we should be aware that the appealing message is but the craftiness and sleight of Satan
Even though this kind of preaching may be inspiring, according to Ephesians 4:13-14, it is but the sleight of the evil one
Even though they love the Lord and are zealous in the church, they can still be tossed and carried away after ten or twenty years
When they pray to Him according to His Word, that is, when they petition Him by the blood of His Son, God often answers their prayer
The Lord clearly said that we should not be anxious for food, drink, or clothing, for all these things the Gentiles anxiously seek
Two weeks later, after finding a place that is bigger than three hundred square feet, he will stand up and testify in the meeting
Two months later when this brother loses his job, he will ask the church to pray for him, and he and his wife will fast and pray at home
God truly looks upon His children, but the things that the brother asks for are only the things that the Gentiles anxiously seek
Just as Gods eternal purpose cannot be fulfilled in an unbeliever it cannot be fulfilled in those who have only learned the lesson of prayer
We may think that we have learned the lesson of prayer, without realizing that Satan has brought us into his system of error
His giving Himself up for us is by dying on the cross; our giving ourselves up for Him is by giving ourselves to Him
Even messages on love, zeal, diligence, meekness, and endurance can become winds of teaching which carry people away from Christ
Ephesians 4:15 says, 'Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
After verse 14 speaks of the sleight of men, craftiness, and a system of error, verse 15 speaks of 'holding to truth'
If a brother's preaching is inspiring but does not cause people to touch Christ, we must refuse it regardless of its appeal
Holding to truth means that we want only one kind of preaching, which is God manifested in the flesh; this is holding to truth in love
In order to face the winds of teaching, we need to hold to truth, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh
Strictly speaking, in the narrow sense, to hold to truth is to hold to the fact of God's manifestation in the flesh
Couples who have been married for a long time look like each other in behavior and demeanor because they are in love
Paul says, 'He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised'
Song of Songs in the Old Testament is a book that begins with love, passes through love, and eventually arrives at love
From the side of the wife, we should become the husband; from the side of the husband, we should become the wife
At the end of the Song of Songs, the Shulammite and Solomon are like each other, and they are in a union of love which is as strong as death
When we hold to truth in love, the result will be that we grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ
In this way, we will grow up into Him in all things; this means that we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
We need to realize that truth refers to the union of God and man; we must reject anything that is not related to this union
We need to hold to the truth of the union of God and man in every matter so that we will grow up into Christ the Head in all things
In the first situation, the believers are carried about by the winds of teaching and have fallen into the enemy's craftiness
In the first, they have entered into a satanic system of error, but in the second, they are growing up into Christ the Head
After we have experienced Ephesians 4:15, every brother and sister will come out of their culture and flesh and grow up into Christ
Out from the Head all the Body will function and cause the growth of the Body; Christ in the Body will increase
The entire Body will be the Word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming the Word; the entire Body will be full of truth
In order for the Body to build itself up in love, there must be the functioning of every joint of the rich supply
Colossians 2:19 says, 'All the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews'
In the church some of the brothers and sisters are like joints and sinews in the Body who can supply others and be knit together with others
They need to receive the riches of the Head and the rich supply of life from the Head in order to supply all the members
The building of the Body is not only through every joint of the rich supply but also through the operation in the measure of each one part
The word at is used three times in verse 13; this does not point to three different goals but to one goal in three stages
To know the Son of God is the beginning, but having the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the ultimate goal
Verse 13 speaks of the goal of the work of the church, and verse 14 speaks of Satan's work in opposing God's goal in verse 13
The tool that Satan uses for his opposing work in the church is the wind of teaching, which causes man to follow him into a system of error
Formerly, nothing we did was in Christ, but now we can grow up into Him in all things because we can hold to truth in love
Because we hold to truth in love, we can reach the point where our entire living and everything we do grows up into Christ
Those who are joints of supply are not the source but rather stations of supply; the source is Christ, the Head
The members who are joints receive the supply from the Head, and then they become stations of supply, each supplying the needs of the Body
From the Bible we can see that the love between God and man causes man to live in God and allows God to live in man
When a church leaves her first love, there is a danger of losing the testimony of the lampstand and the life of the tree of life
We need to understand that the wind of teaching is not the 'wind of pagan religions' as rendered in the Chinese Bible
If we want to stand against Satan's strategy, we must be according to Christ and be joined to Christ in our preaching
If we have truly seen that Christ is the center, no matter what we preach, we will speak from Christ and return to Christ
He said, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
In contrast, many people today debate over the practice of baptism, and these debates take people away from Christ
He said, 'Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ'
If there are sisters who are against head covering, we do not need to debate with them; we must simply bring them into Christ as the center
Concerning the matter of standing against the devil, we cannot skip over Ephesians chapters 1 through 5 and go directly to chapter 6
In order to stand against the devil, we must reign with Christ in ascension because we cannot stand against the devil outside of Christ
Our service in the church is to serve Christ to others; our administration in the church is to administer Christ to others
Among those who listen to their preaching, very few rise up to pursue Christ; they are satisfied with going to heaven after salvation
When we fellowship with them, even though their speaking may not be so clear, it causes us to live in the Lord and pursue His life
The Lord will come to do a killing work in us so that even though our outer man is decaying, our inner man will be renewed day by day
A brother may be unrefined and without much eloquence but he is filled with the Holy Spirit and ministers Christ to people with his speaking
Simply put the truth among us should match the truth in the New Testament which is God manifested in the flesh and the union of God and man
If a message does not have the Son of God as the content, we should immediately conclude that it is a wind of teaching
Whether we are learning to be elders or deacons, our service must take the Son of God as the content and center and minister Him to others
Since we came to Taiwan in 1949, many people can testify that the messages we release have the Son of God as their content
We should always have a shameful feeling before the Lord if we have not sufficiently ministered the Son of God to the brothers and sisters
Some brothers and sisters care about the business affairs of the church and also are diligent; thus, they are suitable to be deacons
The brother should speak something concerning being deacons, and he should also bring these brothers and sisters into the service
After he has worked in that place for a period of time, he should be able to unload his burdens onto some of the brothers and sisters
When his burdens are fully unloaded and the brothers and sisters are able and willing to pick up the burdens, he can leave
The principle of the work of the gifts is absolutely different from that of pastors and preachers in Christianity today
The proper way is for the gifts to be equipped by God and sent by God to different places to teach and perfect the saints to serve God
Everyone who serves the Lord should see this blessed light and should be so clear concerning not replacing but perfecting the saints instead
Not only should the co-workers see this, but the elders in the local churches should also learn to not replace others
We can lead the saints to know the Son of God, to be a full-grown man, and to have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
When the New Jerusalem appears, there will not be a broken brick or stone, nor will there be any wood, grass, and stubble
There will only be gold, pearls, and precious stones; everything will be according to God's nature, God's image, and God's glory
When we see the church from the human standpoint, the church is weak, poor, and wretched; the church is not acceptable
God has already seen the New Jerusalem; she has gold within and precious stones without-she has God's life within and God's glory without
In other words, in order to properly administrate the church, serve the church, and serve God, we must have God's view
With this in mind, we need to focus on the materials that God uses to build the church in addition to how He builds the church
Jesus answered and said to him, 'Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens
From this we can see that a person can truly speak of the church only when he knows the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God
In other words, when a person knows the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, he can speak of the building and the service of the church
In saying that He would build His church upon this rock, the Lord meant that the rock is the foundation of the church
In a theological sense, some people think that the church is built by simply putting Christ together with His believers
When he was in the region of Caesarea Philippi, the veil in heaven was lifted for him, and his eyes were opened
Like a camera, he received something of heaven into him; he received a revelation of the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God
Formerly we were not Christ-men, but one day God opened our eyes, and Christ shined into us; then we became Christ-men
When the Father revealed to Simon that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God, Peter received a revelation of Christ within
In Himself Christ is Christ, but when Christ enters into us, He is built upon Himself in us, and He comes out of us, this is the church
Although He was right before Simon's eyes, He had not entered into Simon and thus could not be mingled with Simon
According to 1 Corinthians 12:12, the church is Christ because the Body, the church, is built with Christ as the material
We touch Christ by revelation and only the Christ who has entered into us through revelation can be built into Christ and produce the church
Paul says that we are God's fellow workers, working together with God to build the church, God's dwelling on earth
The foundation spoken of here is the same as the rock in Matthew 16; the foundation that has been laid is the rock
We should understand the words wood, grass, and stubble figuratively because they are figures conveying certain meanings
All flesh is wood, grass, and stubble because they grow up from the ground, from clay, and are of the earth, the world
If we use wood, grass, and stubble as our materials, they will not remain when they go through the test of fire
It is like clay being changed into a stone, and a stone being changed into a precious stone through the refining of fire
In Revelation 43 the One on the throne is like a precious stone in appearance therefore precious stones signify Gods glory Gods appearance
As a result of the operation of these two aspects in them, they will be like God in appearance; this is the precious stone
Gold signifies God's nature, silver signifies the redemption of the cross, and precious stones signify the glorious image of God
We need to lead them to experience the cross so that their sins and the old creation can be terminated; this is silver
Otherwise, we will be doing something natural, something of the flesh, and something of the world, which are wood, grass, and stubble
We should dispense God's life into others and lead them to experience the cross so that they may live out the glorious image of Christ
Apart from these three things, everything is natural, of the flesh, and of the world, which are wood, grass, and stubble
Peter in Matthew 16 becomes a precious stone, who is shining, bright, and full of the glory in 2 Corinthians 3
In the administration of the church, all of our methods or techniques will be wood, grass, and stubble if we do not see this
May God open our eyes to see that the building of the church is not a matter of method or technique but a matter of material
In other words, this sequence involves dispensing God's life into others so that they may have the gold of God's life and nature
We should lead them to know the cross of Christ and show them that all the problems have been dealt with through the redemption of the cross
In Romans 9, Paul likens man to a lump of clay, and in 1 Corinthians 3, he likens the believers to precious stones
We work together with God for the building of His dwelling place on earth, and this dwelling place will ultimately become a city
The church age does not include those in the Old Testament; it includes only the saved ones in the New Testament
When the New Jerusalem appears, it will not be merely a dwelling place; it will be a city, and the dwelling place will be included in it
The New Jerusalem is a city, and the church is part of it; although the two are different in scope, they are the same in nature
Revelation 21 clearly shows that the New Jerusalem is of pure gold; it is constituted with and full of God's life and nature
The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone, and the first foundation is jasper
The city proper refers to its content, which is pure gold; the wall refers to its appearance, which is precious stones
Having no silver implies that sin and the old creation are no longer present because the cross has terminated everything
The old heaven and old earth have passed away, and everything has become new, so there is no further need for the redemption of the cross
In brief, there is no part of the old creation in the New Jerusalem, so there is no need for the cross; hence, there is no silver
Without gates, we would have no way to enter into a city; if we want to enter into a city, we need to pass through the gates
We have a part in the city because of an entrance; this entrance has been passed on to us from the Jews in the Old Testament
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a pearl
The oyster signifies the Lord Jesus who was wounded in the sea of the world; as grains of sand, we fell into Him
Formerly, we were sand and clay, but the Lord came to the world and was wounded; we fell into Him and have been nourished by His life
Since the entire city is of pure gold the street of the city is surely of gold this denotes that Gods life and nature are our spiritual way
The throne is the center; the twelve gates are on four sides; the street is not straight but a spiral that goes upward
If we enter through this gate, we will step onto this street; if we enter through another gate, we will step onto the same street
We still need the cross, however, because the New Jerusalem has not yet come, and we are still in the church age
When we go to the record in Genesis before man's fall, we can see that the garden of Eden was a miniature of the New Jerusalem
In this garden was a man who was made of dust, a man of clay, and by his side were gold, bdellium, and precious stones
Sadly, the evil one, Satan, came and seduced man to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Through the cross of Christ, God will eventually attain His goal of producing the city of gold, pearl, and precious stones in Revelation
Many people have a wrong understanding of Ephesians 2; they think that it concerns the Gentiles' relationship with God
According to the old creation the Jews were in one realm and the Gentiles were in another people in these two realms could never become near
Verse 14 says, 'For He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity'
The law does not allow the Jews to have any dealings with the Gentiles, and because of this, there was a middle wall, there was enmity
Christ crucified the law and abolished the enmity on the cross so that He might create the two in Himself into one new man
In other words, in the New Testament there is only one new man, not many new men, just as there is only one old man, not many old men
Formerly, they were separated by the law, but now the middle wall of partition has been broken down through the crucifixion of Christ
Before we were saved we were in Adam the old man when we were saved we came out of Adam put off the old man and put on Christ the new man
Because of our inadequate knowledge of this new man, our living still does not bear the full image of the Lord
As we know the Lord more, the new man will be renewed more and more, and the image of the Lord will be manifested more
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free man
Colossians 3:11 indicates that Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free man are on the cross
Whether we are Jews or Greeks, whether we are slaves or free, we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and this Body is Christ
The cross can abolish enmity and every kind of difference because the cross abolished all of the old creation and everything in it
By the cross and by our passing through the cross, Christ has reconciled His redeemed ones and created them in Himself into one new man
In 1 Corinthians 12 those who are Jews Gentiles slaves or free have all been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body into the one new man
We must clearly see that there should be only one result in our service, work, and administration of the church
Tenth, we must be like the apostle Paul who had a living faith, believing that God can accomplish these points
He served God in such a way because God revealed His Son in him so that he might announce Christ among the Gentiles
In the church many brothers and sisters serve the Lord merely out of zeal or diligence, but not out of a revelation of Christ
Some people may be stirred up by their zeal but will not receive Christ through these serving ones if they do not have such a revelation
Although a serving one may believe in the Lord, he must have a clear and specific revelation concerning Christ
Paul not only announced Christ, but in Ephesians 3:8 God charged him 'to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ'
In Galatians he says that God revealed Christ in him; in Ephesians he says that God made known to him the mystery of Christ
Without such a revelation, our gospel preaching will persuade people merely to join a religion and believe in some teachings
If we do not have a revelation a vision of Christ our preaching will persuade others only to join a religion and believe in some teachings
Without revelation, we cannot cause others to see Christ; without vision, we cannot dispense Christ into others
At that time there were many problems in the church in Corinth; some of the saints were fleshy, some were fleshly, and some had sinned
These ten points show how to administrate the church, but these ten points cannot be merely written on paper and become 'Ten Commandments'
Question: Can you give us some instructions on the principle of administrating the church in the aspects of life and practice?
When a message is released in the church, strictly speaking, the number who hear it is not as important as the number who take it in
We do not need to pay attention to the number of people who listen to a message but to the people who receive it
In order for something to be received by the Body, it is sufficient for a representative member of the Body to receive it
Answer: When life increases, the weightiness of the church also increases; the weightiness of the church is the life of Christ
Question: When the number of saved ones increases, does the measure of the stature of the church also increase?
Many times, however, when we have only a little amount of sugar, we try to add more water, and in the end, the taste of the sugar is gone
Without the increase of Christ, no matter how much we preach the gospel, the flavor of Christ in the church will eventually be lost
An increase in the number of believers does not produce an increase in the measure of the stature of the church
With more drum-beating and gong-striking, 'two more buckets of water' can be added, but in the end, there may be no flavor of Christ
The measure of Christ in the saints is according to the measure of Christ that has been ministered from us to them
We must administrate the church properly otherwise the more we preach the gospel the more the flavor of Christ will decrease in the church
If there is no addition of 'sugar' but only a continual addition of 'water,' the flavor of Christ will be lost
Seemingly, godliness is outward, and mystery is inward; actually, godliness is not only outward but also inward
During the great persecution of the Roman Empire, the persecuted ones were truly godly because God was manifested through them
When the unbelievers saw them, they were like the country woman who marveled at the shining of the electric lamps
In both cases, before God we must know Christ, live in Christ, be filled with Christ, and allow Christ to occupy us
Regardless of whether we serve one person or a hundred people, we need to minister Christ to them; there is no difference
Whether one person receives our help or one hundred people receive our help, it is the same; there must be the increase of Christ
Although Paul was imprisoned, he was not at all ashamed; rather, Christ was magnified in him as always and even more
It is strange that even though our mouth takes in all of our food, it does not grow bigger; rather, our thighs grow quite much
We who serve in the church must see that the New Jerusalem is what God intends to work out throughout the ages
If two young saints are planning to be married soon, their spirit and attitude will be filled with marriage between now and that day
What they see, what they speak, and what their heart is filled with are altogether related to the matter of marriage
They have a certain matter within them so that what they see, what they speak, and what their heart cares about are related to this matter
The most precious point in this portion of the Scriptures is not Paul's prayer and faith but his spirit and attitude
Paul knelt down to pray because he was so burdened; something heavy within forced him to bow his knees unto the Father
When the tabernacle was erected, the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle, and the children of Israel saw glory
When Ezekiel described what he saw, he did not speak of seeing God; instead, he spoke of seeing the glory of God
The expression of the intrinsic nature of electricity in the light of the electric lamp is the 'glory' of electricity
Colossians shows that the inward content in the Godhead is the riches, and the glory that is expressed is the fullness
The riches in Ephesians 3:16 are the riches of the Godhead, and the glory as the expression of the riches of the Godhead is the fullness
Paul asked God to grant the believers to be strengthened into their inner man 'according to the riches of His glory'
In the same way, some sisters are very strong, but their strength shows the flesh and their being full of will and opinions
Paul did not speak of Christ earlier; he only spoke of glory and the Spirit, but the issue is Christ making His home in our hearts
Being rooted and grounded enables us to apprehend with all the saints what are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth
If we have seen how great Christ is, we will not quarrel with the brothers and sisters, much less with our wives and husbands
On that day, we will also know the length, which is Christ; the height, which is Christ; and the depth, which is Christ
In administrating the church, all the responsible brothers must take this as their spirit, their attitude, and their hope
They should not hope merely that all the saints will come to the meetings, be zealous, preach the gospel, and bring people to salvation
The responsible brothers should be clear as to what they take as their goal: is it an increase in numbers or an increase in Christ?
We need to receive mercy not to think that it is sufficient for the brothers and sisters only to be zealous and come to the meetings
Even if all the people in Taiwan came to the meetings and were zealous, it would mean nothing if they did not know Christ inwardly
Perhaps some may say, 'It is not easy to pray that the brothers and sisters would be fervent and rise up to meet
He spoke of 'Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us'
When God answers her prayer and she not only has a son but twin boys, this is seemingly above what she asked or thought
No matter what our present condition is, we should have the faith that the New Jerusalem will eventually be manifested
The New Jerusalem is the complete expression of God's glory; the church today should be a miniature of the New Jerusalem
If all of our spirit attitude prayer and faith are for this one thing the brothers and sisters will be filled unto all the fullness of God
