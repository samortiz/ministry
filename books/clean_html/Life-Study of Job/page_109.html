<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. The Father, the Lord, and the Spirit<br>as the Triune God Becoming<br>the Source, the Element,<br>and the Essence of the Church<br>as the Body of Christ</H2><P>Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the Triune God have become the source, the element, and the essence of the church as the Body of Christ. God the Father is the source, God the Son is the element, and God the Spirit is the essence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Christ as the Divine Portion<br>Allotted to the Saints by God<br>and as Life to the Believers<br>Having Become All the Members of the New Man</H2><P>Christ as the divine portion allotted to the saints by God and as life to the believers has become all the members of the new man, which is His organic Body (Col. 1:12; 3:4a, 10-11; 1 Cor. 12:12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. God Wanting to Make Christ,<br>the Embodiment of God, Everything to Us</H2><P>In Colossians 1:15-19 we see that God wants to make Christ, the embodiment of God, everything to us, the believers of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. God in Christ<br>Carrying Out His Transforming Work on Us<br>until His Transformation<br>Consummates in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>God in Christ will carry out His transforming work on us until His transformation consummates in the New Jerusalem, firstly with the overcomers in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 2:7) and consummately with all the saints in the new heaven and new earth, making all His chosen and redeemed people His corporate expression, manifesting Himself, not any kind of merely human virtues, to the fullest extent in eternity (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><P>Job and his friends were devoid of all the above divine revelations. God's dealing with Job in all the disasters and His stripping him of all that he was, were to take away his contentment in his godly attainments and obtainments and to remove all the barriers and coverings so that he could be emptied for some further seeking after God and could realize that he was very short of something in his human life. At the end of the book of Job, after all, God came in, indicating that what Job was short of in his human life was God Himself. But up to the age of Job, there was not a revelation like what is positively, clearly, and fully unveiled in the New Testament. For this reason, the book of Job does not actually have a completed ending, which should be God fully gained in Christ by Job to make him one with God that he might enjoy God as his portion in Christ. Such a revelation can be fully found only in the New Testament.</P>
