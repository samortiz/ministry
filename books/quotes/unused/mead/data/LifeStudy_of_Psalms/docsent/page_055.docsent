   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to consider the book of Psalms in the light of these two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are the appreciators of the law, as David was in Psalm 1, we are on the line of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People may wonder what is wrong with good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we trace this line to the end of the Bible, we arrive at the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you "drive" to and arrive at the end of the divine revelation on this line, you know you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The line of good and evil leads to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The person in Psalm 2 takes refuge in the Son and kisses the Son, loves the Son v. 12 . This one surely is on the line of life leading to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be those who are on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The person in Psalm 15 is on the line of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 16, however, reveals Christ as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has been, still is, and always will be on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those of us on the line of life will eventually be in the New Jerusalem, the city of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the fall of man, the Bible tells us that Adam had two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, I believe Adam had more sons, but only two sons are recorded in the Bible because these two sons represent two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first son was Cain, and the second son was Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cain was a representative of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At first, he was good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He presented the offerings of the labor of his own hands to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was good according to Cain's way, but he was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God rejects man's evil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God also rejects man's good as evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then when Cain was rejected by God, he immediately turned to kill his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was evil Gen 4:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, he did something good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, he did something evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both good and evil are in the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cain was in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abel, however, was not in this line.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He enjoyed Christ as his burnt offering to contact God and to take God as his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abel was in the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The title of this message is a question.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the question David asks in Psalm 15 "What kind of man may dwell with God for His heart's desire and good pleasure?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may think that the man of good can dwell with God, but not the man of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Good and evil are our two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Teachers of philosophy and those of many religions would all say that if there is a God, only a good man, not an evil man, could dwell with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of them would hold the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But thank the Lord, in the Bible, which is His divine revelation, we have a pair of psalms, Psalms 15 and 16, to show us what kind of man God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not want an evil man or a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God rejects the good man as the evil man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are of the same source, in the same nature, and in the same entity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are in the same line and will arrive at the same end. Only a God-man can satisfy God's desire and fulfill His good pleasure.</S>
