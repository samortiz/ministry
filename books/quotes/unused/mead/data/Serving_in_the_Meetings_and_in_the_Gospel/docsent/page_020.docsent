   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING BALANCED IN FIVE MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to our training and experience in the church life, we have learned that we must stress the balance of five things: life, truth, service, gospel preaching, and going out for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of life is very basic; we need life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then as regards the truth, we must be trained to know the word of the Scriptures in a proper, living way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The service is the Body life and includes the meetings and every kind of function and ministry in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we must also have gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to this, we need to go out for the gospel, not as apostles but simply as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts the first way for the spread of the gospel was not the way of apostles going out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was the way of the disciples being scattered Acts 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples were scattered by the persecution in Jerusalem, and wherever they went, they brought the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the spreading of the gospel and the expanding of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to go on with the Lord in the way of His recovery, we need to be balanced by stressing all the above matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>HAVING BOTH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE FISHING AND MENDING MINISTRIES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we saw in a previous chapter, after the Lord was anointed to minister, he called two pairs of disciples, representing two kinds of ministries Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the first pair was called, they were fishing by casting a net, and when the second pair was called, they were mending their nets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fishing ministry is to bring people in, and the mending ministry is to keep them from falling out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fishing ministry is to open the front door, while the mending ministry is to close the back door, to keep people in to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through Peter, who had the fishing ministry, the doors of the kingdom were opened 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The keys of the kingdom were given to him, and he used them to bring people in. Today in the church there must be many Peters with the fishing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherever they go, the door will be open, and they will bring people in.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then after Peter brings people in, John follows with the mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People should only come in; they should not go out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They come in the front door and should not go out the back door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The back door has to be mended closed in order to keep people in until they are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually the New Jerusalem comes out of the mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one who wrote about the New Jerusalem was not Peter but John, who had the mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fishing ministry is for the start, while the mending ministry is for the accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church we need these two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, with these two ministries there is the possibility for the building, so between the fishing and the mending ministries there is the building ministry of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must have the outreach.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must bring unbelievers to the Lord, spread the word of the gospel, and expand the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would encourage you, even burden you, to take care of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, we are not balanced; we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>HAVING THE RIGHT WAY TO CATCH PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After we are burdened, we will want to know the way to reach people, to catch the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To do anything, we need certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a general leads an army to take a city, for example, he may take several ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Depending on the situation, he may come from different directions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, one city should be taken in the morning, while another city should be taken at night; and one should be taken from the north, but another should be taken from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, to bring a person to the Lord we must have wisdom to know the proper time and the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here we can only give principles; you must practice them to learn the details.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Way of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to our past experiences, there are at least ten ways to deal with a person for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to catch people, we must realize what they are and where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first way to catch people is with the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not the only way, nor is it the best way, but it is one of the prevailing ways.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All people on the earth are sinful; they are sinners, and many are in a very bad situation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, it is not right to touch everyone by dealing with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is only right if they are conscious that they are sinful and to some degree desire victory over and deliverance from their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a person is like this, this is the best opportunity to use this way to catch him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to strike his conscience even the more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a one is already conscious that he is sinful, but we still need to make him more conscious of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This creates a hunger and thirst to be saved and a realization of how much he needs salvation and deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most important thing for a salesman is to create a market.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When there is a market, it is easy to sell, but if there is no market, no one will buy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to create the need within a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this purpose, we must know the best passages to use from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are familiar with the best passages, they will be ready and handy to us to deal with this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are two aspects of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One aspect is the nature of sin, and the other is the outward deeds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should be familiar with these two aspects and know how to deal with a person in both ways.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we deal with a sinner, we should remember not to talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Salesmen know the secret of making a deal and then not talking too much; if they talk too much, they will lose the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After making a deal, a salesman gets the buyer to sign and pay; for us this means that we ask the sinner to pray.</S>
