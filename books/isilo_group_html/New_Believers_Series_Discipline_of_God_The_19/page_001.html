THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br>OF THOSE UNDER DISCIPLINE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Struggling against Sin,<br>Having Not Yet Resisted unto Blood</H2><P>Let us consider Hebrews 12:4-13, point by point.</P><P>Verse 4 says, "You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin." In this verse the apostle said that the Hebrew believers had struggled against sin. But even though they had suffered much, gone through great trials, encountered various problems, and met with much persecution, they had not yet resisted unto blood. If we compare these sufferings with that of our Lord, they are quite light! Verse 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross. What a believer goes through is far less severe than what the Lord went through! The Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross unto the shedding of blood. Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Finding the Reasons for Our Sufferings</H2><P>What should a person expect after he becomes a Christian? We should never put a false hope before the brothers. We should show them that we will encounter many problems. However, God's purpose and meaning are behind all of them. We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations? Unless the Lord grants us the privilege of becoming martyrs, we will probably not have the chance to resist and struggle against sin "unto blood." But even though it is not a resistance unto blood, we are nevertheless resisting! Why do these things happen to us?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not Fainting nor Regarding Lightly</H2><P>Verses 5 and 6 say, "You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, `My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"</P><P>The apostle quoted Proverbs in the Old Testament in this portion of the Word. He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint. A believer should adopt these two attitudes. Some regard difficulties, sufferings, and God's discipline as insignificant matters. They do not think much of them and easily allow God's discipline to slip by. There are also some who faint when they go through the Lord's reproach and fall into His hand. As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life. They expect their way to be smooth. Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments. It never occurred to them that Christians would experience all kinds of difficulties. They are not prepared to be Christians under such circumstances. They faint and waver at the difficulties along the way. Proverbs shows us that both of these attitudes are wrong.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | First | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>New Believers Series: Discipline of God, The #19 &nbsp; pg 1</div><br></body></html>
