The King James Version renders the word abodes in John 14:2 as mansions, but this is a poor translation. In verse 23 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; In Greek, the singular word abode in verse 23 is mone, the same word translated by some in the plural as mansions in verse 2. Moreover, the verb form of this word, meno, is found in 15:4, which says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221;<p>The correct usage of abode is found in 14:23, which says that if someone loves the Son, the Father and the Son will come to him and make an abode with him. To be sure, the abode mentioned here is a matter of persons, not a place. How then can the same word refer to persons in verse 23 and to &#8220;heavenly mansions&#8221; in verse 2? This is not a sound interpretation.<p>The many &#8220;mansions&#8221; are in actuality many abodes. In the Father&#8217;s house, which is the temple, there are many members, and every member is an abode. This thought is very deep. In John 14 the Lord was about to die and resurrect, and by His death and resurrection He made us all a part of the temple, which is the Father&#8217;s house. Before His death, we were simply the old man, having nothing to do with God&#8217;s temple. However, through His death and resurrection we were made a part of, that is, members of, this temple.<h2 class=head2>Bringing the Disciples into the Father, Where Christ Is</h2><p>John 14:2b-3 says, &#8220;I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again.&#8221; The King James Version translates &#8220;I am coming again&#8221; as &#8220;I will come again,&#8221; and some interpret this to refer to the Lord&#8217;s second coming. If we are not clear about the grammatical construction of verse 3, we cannot properly understand it. This verse does not say that Christ will come but that He is coming, indicating that His going was His coming.<p>Perhaps none of us have ever said, &#8220;If I go, I am coming&#8221;; apparently, this is a peculiar construction. However, while the Lord was going, He was coming. According to the concept of the Gospel of John, the Lord&#8217;s going was His dying. The Lord was saying, &#8220;If I go to die, I am coming back.&#8221; Clearly then, His coming back refers to His resurrection. In the evening of the day of resurrection Christ came back to His disciples.<p>Verse 3b says, &#8220;I am coming again and will receive you to Myself.&#8221; This verse says that He would receive the disciples not into the heavens but to Himself. Even at the very time that the Lord was speaking to the disciples, they were still not in Him. Rather, they were outside of Him. Now the Lord was going to do something to bring them into Himself. This is the proper meaning of this verse. Jesus was going to do something to enable Him to receive them into Himself.<p>Verses 3-6 continue, &#8220;So that where I am you also may be. And where I am going you know the way. Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; Our thought may have been that no one comes to heaven except through Jesus, but this verse says that the One to whom we come is the Father.<p>Verses 10-11 say, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.&#8221; At that time, where was the Lord? Jesus did not say, &#8220;I am in heaven.&#8221; Rather, He said, &#8220;I am in the Father.&#8221; Moreover, in verse 3 He had said, &#8220;Where I am you also may be.&#8221; The Lord was about to do something to bring the disciples to the Father, where He was.<p>Then in verses 16-18 Jesus says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&#8221; &#8220;I am coming to you&#8221; is different from &#8220;I will come to you,&#8221; as the King James Version says. The former indicates that while the Lord was speaking this word, He was already on the way; He was already coming.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
