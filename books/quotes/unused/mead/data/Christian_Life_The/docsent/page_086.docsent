   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Union requires two parties, so there must be a two-way traffic of divinity being brought into humanity and of humanity being brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God united Himself with us; then He caused us to be united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's uniting Himself with us in His incarnation is a one-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in His resurrection, He brought us, the flesh, into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the completion of a traffic of two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The identification, the union, between God and man took a long time to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God made man about six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 3:15 God promised fallen man that He would come as the seed of the woman, indicating His incarnation, but He did not come right away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After two thousand years, He repeated nearly the same promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told Abraham that in his seed singular all the nations would be blessed Gen 22:18; Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15 would be the seed of Abraham, a descendant of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God waited for still another two thousand years to fulfill this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From Adam to Abraham, there were two thousand years; and from Abraham to Christ, there were another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were altogether four thousand years from the creation of Adam to the incarnation of Christ as the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God came to join Himself to the flesh, to us, to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He lived on the earth in humanity for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The "divine factory" did not produce the mingling of God and man in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For God to fully accomplish His union with man, He had to pass through human living, pass through death, and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did this to bring humanity, to which He had united Himself, into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament tells us that when He died on the cross, He died with us Gal 2:20a , because He died on the cross in the flesh, and we are the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was in union with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was crucified in His flesh 1 Pet 3:18; Col 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ's divinity was not crucified; divinity cannot be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His divinity includes the eternal life, the resurrection life; nothing can kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ died in His flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He became incarnated, He identified God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He died and resurrected with us, He identified us with God.</S>
