   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE PRECIOUSNESS OF ZION AND JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE EXPERIENCES AND PRAISES OF THE SAINTS 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 128 134</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we covered the first eight of the Psalms of Ascents.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider the remaining seven, Psalms 128 through 134.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sequence of these seven psalms is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 128 speaks of Jehovah's blessing to Israel from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem in Israel's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 129 concerns God's righteous dealing with the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On this earth there is a people chosen by God as His elect, and this people is always persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is true of the believers today, who may be persecuted for preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, Zion, the highest peak of that range of mountains, signifies the overcomers in the church, the higher ones among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as Zion was hated, so the overcomers also are hated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God comes in to deal righteously with those who persecute Israel and hate Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Israel is God's elect, and God deals with those who persecute His people, but this does not mean that Israel is perfect and sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, Israel has many sins and iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, in Psalm 130 we have a psalm of forgiveness and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 131 indicates that after we experience God's forgiveness, we become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Formerly, we were proud and even haughty, thinking that we alone were right and that others were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But after we are enlightened concerning our real situation, make a thorough confession, and receive God's forgiveness, we become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We humble our heart, lower our eyes, and our soul becomes quiet "like a weaned child with its mother" v. 2 . I have had this experience many times, realizing that I am nothing, that I have nothing, and that I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our heart is humbled and our soul is quiet, we are in a condition that is suitable for God to come in to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In such a situation God can have a resting place, a dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when we are proud and our eyes are haughty, God has no rest, no dwelling place, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only when we are humble, calm, and quiet is the situation right for God to rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is Zion becoming God's habitation, His resting place, as revealed in Psalm 132.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Next, Psalm 133 shows us that Zion is the unique place where the brothers can come together in unity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Zion is the uniting center.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In any other place we are scattered and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God has His rest, His dwelling place, in Zion, we can come to Him in Zion and dwell there in unity with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How good and how pleasant this is!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is like the fine oil, signifying the anointing, upon Aaron, and it is also like the morning dew, signifying grace, that descends from Mount Hermon to the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that, as God's people, we need both the anointing and the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, in Zion God has a place where He can command His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in Zion we receive the commanded blessing of God, even life forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, in Psalm 134 the children of Israel first charge the priests to praise God in the night, and then they bless the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whereas the priests taught and blessed the children of Israel, here the children of Israel teach and bless the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the children of Israel have become higher than the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sequence of Psalms 128 through 134 is logical and reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We enjoy God's blessing from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem, and then God deals with those who persecute us and hate us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, we are sinful and need God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we receive His forgiveness, we become humble, calm, and quiet, and God comes in to rest, to dwell, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we come up to Him to dwell in unity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, we become Mount Zion; that is, we become the highest people, those who are even higher than the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that we have seen the sequence of these seven psalms, let us consider each psalm in particular.</S>
