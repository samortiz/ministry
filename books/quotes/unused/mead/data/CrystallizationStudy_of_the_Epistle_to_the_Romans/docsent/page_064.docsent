   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How can we be kings when we cannot rule our children in the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We believers who are parents must exercise ourselves to learn how to be kings in ruling our children.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must have grace to rule our children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We also have to rule over the sin within us, to rule over Satan, and to rule over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should not let the world s fashion conquer us.</S>
