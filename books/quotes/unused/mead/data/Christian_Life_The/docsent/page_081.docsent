   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The majority of Christians today do not have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who do not have the church life may stay home in the evening to watch television.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we who practice the church life have a rule, and that rule is to attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To us, to attend the church meetings is a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Another rule is found in Philippians 3, that is, to pursue Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verses 12 and 16 Paul made the pursuing of Christ a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This rule is for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not live Christ and pursue Christ, it will be difficult for us to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are strict in pursuing Christ so that we may gain Him to live the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every human being has two aspects to his living his common, daily life and his business life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person who operates a business or has a job must go to the office every morning by a certain specified time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, he must keep the rule, the regulation, of rising early every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, he must go to the office five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, on Saturday morning he is free to remain in bed for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On Saturday he still lives his life, but he does not live it for his job.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, he lives a common, daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, every person must live two kinds of lives, one for his ordinary daily life and another for his job, for his purpose, his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We Christians also should have two kinds of walks.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first is the general walk in our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Things such as overcoming our temper are included in this kind of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second is a walk according to rules, a walk in line, in an orderly, regulated manner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of walk includes things such as attending the church meetings and speaking in the meetings for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our Christian life people may realize that, because we are a Christian, we would not lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the testimony of our general, daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People may know us also as those who attend the church meetings on the Lord's Day morning and on other nights of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the testimony of our walk according to rules.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Galatians 6:15-16 Paul said, "For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To live a new creation by walking according to the rule of the new creation is the second kind of walk, the walk by rules.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been regenerated to be a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 ; hence, we must walk by the rule, by the regulation, of a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we are a new creation, and because we have a goal, a purpose, there are certain things that we would not do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new creation is just the church life, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have a goal, a purpose, requires us to live a life by rules.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the second aspect of the Christian walk must be supported by the first.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not live the first kind of walk, we cannot have the second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are a loose person, a busybody who gossips all the time, we will not be able to live a life that is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our walk for a purpose, for a goal, must be supported by our general, daily walk.</S>
