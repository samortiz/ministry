   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Purpose of Calling</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men need to call on the name of the Lord in order to be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way of praying quietly does help people to be saved, but not so richly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way of calling loudly helps people to be saved in a richer and more thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we need to encourage people to open themselves and to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 116 tells us that we may partake of the Lord's salvation by calling on Him: "I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord'' v. 13 . In this one Psalm, calling on the Lord is mentioned four times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2,4,13,17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water out of the wells of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord Isa 12:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians have never called upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have never called, even shouted before the Lord, it is doubtful that you have enjoyed the Lord in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Call upon His name Cry out and shout '' Isa 12:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Try shouting before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have never shouted about what the Lord is to you, try it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more you shout, "O Lord Jesus, You are so good to me!'' the more you will be released from your self and filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thousands of saints have been released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this time, it may be good for you to stop reading and call on the name of the Lord out loud for at least five minutes to experience that the Lord is rich to those who call.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You will strengthen your spirit this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. The Way to Call</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How should we call on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must call on Him out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our heart, which is the source of our calling, must be pure, seeking nothing except the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, we must call with a pure lip Zeph 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to watch our speech, for nothing contaminates our lips more than loose talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our lips are impure due to loose talk, it will be difficult for us to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Along with a pure heart and pure lips, we need to have an open mouth Psa 81:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to open our mouth wide to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, we need to call on the Lord corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Timothy 2:22 says, "Flee also youthful lusts: but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.''</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to come together for the purpose of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 88:9 says, "Lord, I have called daily upon thee.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we should call daily upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, Psalm 116:2 says,'' therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we live, we should call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>E. The Need of Practice</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Calling on the name of the Lord is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to practice it daily and hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should never stop our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We hope that many more of the Lord's people, especially new believers, will begin the practice of calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, many Christians have found that they can know Him, that they can be brought into the power of His resurrection, that they can experience His spontaneous salvation, and that they can walk in oneness with Him by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In any situation, at any time, call "Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you practice calling on His name, you will see that it is a wonderful way to enjoy the Lord's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this enjoyable practice our spirit will be strengthened for us to experience life every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, growth in life will be the result.</S>
