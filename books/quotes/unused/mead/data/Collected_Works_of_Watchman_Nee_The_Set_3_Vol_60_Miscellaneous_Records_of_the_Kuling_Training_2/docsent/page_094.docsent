   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Judaizers' Interpretation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord's Redemption Based on Daniel 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another error of the Judaizers is their interpretation of the vision in Daniel 8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They explain Daniel 8:3-25 by saying that the little horn refers to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is altogether wrong and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel saw the vision of the ram in 8:3 and 4 and the vision of the male goat in verses 5 to 14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verses 20 and 21 he interprets the ram to be Persia, and the male goat to be the king of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, to new ones we need not give such details.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 5 says that the male goat has a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 8 says that this horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a while these four horns also passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 9 then says that out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which was beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And it grew great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we have three periods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The big horn refers to Alexander; he was the first king of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 22 says that after this horn was broken, four other horns were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This refers to the four kingdoms produced by the Greek empire after the time of Alexander.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 23 says that when the transgressions of these four kingdoms were filled up, a king would arise, which would be the little horn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that in the future, a little horn will come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Daniel 8:9-14 tells us about this little horn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this passage, the little horn is exceedingly fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"That which is beautiful" in verse 9 refers to the land of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To cause some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth and to trample them refers to the arrogance of the Antichrist who will attempt to confront God and to destroy His sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of the transgression, he will throw down the truth and the sacrifices among the children of Israel, and he will take action and prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When will all these be fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 14 says, "For two thousand three hundred nights and days; then the sanctuary will be restored."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can summarize the above in this way: 1 The little horn is the Antichrist, which will come out of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2 He will carry out his activities within the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the tribulation, the Israelites will have a rebuilt sanctuary and will offer sacrifices there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the sacrificial service will be handed over to the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 The sanctuary will be delivered to the Antichrist for 2,300 days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the period of time during which the Antichrist will occupy the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based on Daniel 8:14, the Judaizers concocted the theory that when the Lord died on the cross, He shed His blood to redeem us from sin; yet the job was not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He had to wait until 2,300 years were fulfilled, when He would come again and bring the redeeming blood to heaven, that is, to the heavenly sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would then cleanse the sanctuary and come back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They say that a day is a year, and 2,300 days means 2,300 years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But one cannot make a day a year here in Daniel 8 because the sanctuary was never trampled for that long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Judaizers start counting from 457 B.C., the time of the little horn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This brings them to the year A.D. 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They say that this is the time when the little horn trampled the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this is contrary to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their interpretation is unfounded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The 2,300 days in 8:14 are literally 2,300 nights and 2,300 days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It cannot refer to 2,300 years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From where did this interpretation of the Judaizers come?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the last century there was a man called William Miller, who was with the Seventh-day Adventists.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After he read Daniel 8, he proposed interpreting a day as a year and taught that from the time the sanctuary was trampled, which was 457 B.C., until A.D. 1844, there were 2,300 years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He expected the Lord to come by 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In that year he sold all he had.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He got rid of all his belongings and went up to the mountain in the afternoon to wait for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord did not come as expected, he said that his calculation was wrong, and that the Lord should come in November of that year instead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When November came around, the Lord still did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who followed him and who had sold all their possessions fell into a very embarrassing condition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After this incident, many went back to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a terrible teaching of the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But there are about two hundred thousand people who believe in this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How do they explain Miller's blunder?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They say that the Lord did not come to the earth in 1844, but entered the heavenly sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1844 the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven and entered the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later, He also entered the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some naturally ask, "What has the Lord been doing in the sanctuary since 1844?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They say that He is there as the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They say that the Lord did not cleanse the sanctuary until 1844 and that He is there as the priest and is continuing the cleansing work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the Judaizers to emphasize the Sabbath is one thing, but when they touch the Lord's person and His work, they touch something serious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They say that the Lord did not enter the sanctuary to do the cleansing work until 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This heretical teaching of the Judaizers is too absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet many children of God choose to believe in them.</S>
