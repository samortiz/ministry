   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to God s Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Abraham returned from his slaughtering of Chedorlaomer and his allied kings, Melchisedec went forth to meet Abraham, who had fought for God and won the victory, and to minister to him bread and wine Gen 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a type of what Christ ministers to His believers at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Matthew 26, on the night before He left His disciples, the Lord Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The bread on the Lord s table is a symbol signifying the Lord s body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By partaking of His broken body, we participate in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cup signifies our enjoyment of God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion Psa 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Adam our portion was the cup of God s wrath, which would have sent us to the lake of fire to suffer the torment of eternal perdition Rev 14:10; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, God made the Lord Jesus drink the cup of wrath on the cross for us John 18:11 , causing Him to suffer God s righteous judgment on our behalf and to taste the torment of perdition of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, thereby enacting the new covenant for us and bringing us instead the cup of salvation Psa 116:13 as the cup that runs over 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this cup of salvation are all the blessing of God and even God Himself as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as our Melchisedec today brings His life and all God s blessings with Him to His table to minister to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the Lord s table, the life signified by the bread and the blessings signified by the cup are the constant supply to us of our Lord as our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Blessing God s Victor 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greater Blessing the Lesser</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Melchisedec came to meet the victorious Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth Gen 14:19 , as the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This proves that he was greater than Abraham, since it is customary for the lesser to be blessed by the greater Heb 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This signifies the greatness and superiority of Christ, the perpetual, great, and kingly High Priest, who blesses us.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Receiving Tithes from God s Victor</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham gave tithes of the choice spoils to Melchisedec Gen 14:20; Heb 7:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This fact proves the greatness of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ, as a Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, is greater than the priests of the tribe of Levi, who also paid tithes to Melchisedec through their father Abraham Heb 7:9 , since they were in Abraham s loins when he met Melchisedec v. 10 . This shows us that such a great Christ is worthy to receive offerings and honor from all the victorious ones.</S>
