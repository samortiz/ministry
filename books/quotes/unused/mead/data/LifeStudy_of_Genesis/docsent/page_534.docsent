   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Offering Sacrifices to God at Beersheba</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>before Going to See Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 46:1 says, "And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 35:1 God told Jacob to arise and go up to Bethel and to make an altar there unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in 46:1 Jacob went to Beersheba to offer sacrifices on his own initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse does not say that he offered a sacrifice; it says that he "offered sacrifices."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He went to Beersheba for the purpose of offering sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse does not tell us that Jacob prayed, praised, or gave thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it says that he offered sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did so that he might have true fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Using New Testament terms, Jacob offered for God's satisfaction the Christ he had experienced in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the worship God desires to receive from us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this worship is related to our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are matured, we shall frequently worship God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God did not ask Jacob to go to Beersheba and offer sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jacob went there of his own accord to offer Christ for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The next verse says, "And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Notice that this verse does not speak of a vision, but of visions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During that night in Beersheba, God appeared to Jacob at least twice and spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are young in life, we often say, "Lord, what is Your mind?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please tell me what You want me to do."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in chapter forty-six Jacob did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of asking God for guidance, he offered sacrifices for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, during the night, God appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see the kind of fellowship a saint mature in life has with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no praying, praising, giving of thanks, or seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, there is the offering of Christ to God for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this kind of worship, Jacob had fellowship with God, and God appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This surely is another manifestation of Jacob's maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot imitate Jacob's degree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our degree of life is always related to our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not have the growth, we simply cannot have the degree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although you may pretend, perform, or act, you still do not have the degree of life you are imitating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we all need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we grow into a certain degree of life, spontaneously we shall have the manifestation of life related to that degree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>c No Excitement Showing Looseness of Self</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>at Seeing Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another sign of Jacob's maturity was that he displayed no excitement showing looseness of self at seeing Joseph 46:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob was not excited, because his heart had become numb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is all right for young people to be excited, but there should be no looseness in their excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There must still be a certain amount of control.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes my grandchildren are so loose in their excitement that they are destructive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One of them became so excited that he even walked on the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Children who display such looseness need to be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, you young people must be excited, and the churches and halls filled with young people must be exciting places.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may even "raise the roof" with your excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more the young people are excited, the better it is; for the more excited they are, the faster they grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have never seen a numb child grow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Children need to be active and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that they are living, healthy, and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I enjoy the excitement of the young people because it is a sign of their normality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This assures me that they will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in your excitement there should not be any looseness or lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the midst of your excitement, your spirit may say, "Be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Don't do too much or go too far."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This control is right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Young people, I encourage you to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although I am an old man, I do not like to be in an old people's meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I prefer to attend the young people's meeting and stay in a church filled with young people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although they may not yet have transformation and maturity, they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The presence of life gives me the assurance that growth, transformation, and maturity will eventually follow.</S>
