   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WALK IN LOVE AND IN LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The text for this crucial point is in Ephesians 5:1-15.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 2 tells us to walk in love, and verse 8 tells us to walk as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8, 9, 13 are the basic elements in the apostle s exhortation in 5:1-33.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is the expression of love and love is the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Truth is the revelation of light and light is the origin of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is love and light 1 John 4:8; 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace, and His light becomes truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we have, in the Lord, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Love and light are deeper than grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the apostle first takes grace and truth as the basic elements for his exhortation and then love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This implies that he wants our daily walk to grow deeper, from the outward element to the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The inner love of God is sensible, and the outer light of God is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This should be the inner source of our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is deeper than grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In studying this crucial point it will also help you to refer to the Life-study Messages and to note 53 in 1 John 1 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO BE FILLED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ephesians 5:18 to be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit our regenerated spirit, not God s Spirit is to be filled with Christ 1:23 , unto the fullness of God 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be drunk with wine in the body dissipates us, but to be filled with Christ, the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God 5:19-20 and to subject ourselves to one another v. 21 . The issue of our being filled in spirit is that we will have spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life v. 22 6:9 . The proper daily life and family life is the issue of being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This crucial point is covered in 5:18 6:9.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE GREAT MYSTERY CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This particular crucial point is covered in Ephesians 5:23-33.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his exhortation in chapter five, the apostle presents the church as the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This aspect of the church reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-22 , that she has the same life and nature as Christ, and that she, as His counterpart, becomes one with Him as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ and the church being one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SPIRITUAL WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the positive side, the church is portrayed in many ways in the first five chapters of Ephesians to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the negative side, the church is seen in chapter six as a warrior to defeat God s enemy, the Devil vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>10-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To do this we need to put on the whole armor of God v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our weapons do not avail, but God s armor, even the whole armor of God, does.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the corporate warrior, not any individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This crucial point is covered in verses 10 through 20 of Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TO LOVE THE LORD IN INCORRUPTION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians 6:24 says, Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all must ask ourselves what it means to love the Lord in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Timothy 1:17 Paul says that God is incorruptible, and in 2 Timothy 1:10 he says that the Lord nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Corinthians 15 tells us that in resurrection the corruptible things will become incorruptible vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>50-53 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To love the Lord in incorruption means to love Him in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the things of the old creation are corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is proved by Romans 8 where we see that the whole creation is groaning under the slavery of corruption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything of the old creation is corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the new creation is not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ephesians 6:24 is a total conclusion of the entire book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the six chapters of Ephesians Paul surely reveals to us the incorruptible things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is incorruptible, the church is incorruptible, and all the positive items related to Christ and the church in chapters one through six are incorruptible items.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must love the Lord in these incorruptible things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means we must love the Lord in the new creation and not in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to love the Lord according to the Father s predestination unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to love the Lord according to the Son s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to love the Lord according to the sealing and the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to love the Lord according to the hope of God s calling, according to the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and according to the surpassing greatness of His power which made Christ the Head of all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to love the Lord according to Christ s resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to love the Lord according to all the incorruptible things revealed in the six chapters of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must love the Lord in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times we love the Lord in the way of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not love the Lord in a natural way, in the way of the old creation, but in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When some Christian groups wanted to raise money, they put out a list of those who gave, with the ones giving the most at the top of the list.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is to love the Lord in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is it to love the Lord in incorruption in giving?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing Matt 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To give in the way of making a show is in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As the kingdom people, our righteous deeds should be kept secret as much as possible Matt 6:4, 6, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What we do in our spirit, under the heavenly rule to please solely our Father, must not be interfered with by our flesh lusting for man s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The kingdom people s living is by the Father s divine life according to their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Any public exhibition does not correspond with the mysterious, hidden nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Matthew 6:4 the Lord says that our alms should be in secret, and our Father who sees in secret shall repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To do things in the way of not making a display or a show of oneself is in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sometimes when a brother testifies, he testifies because he likes to make a show or a display.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When his testifying gets many amens, he feels glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is to function in corruption because it is in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you are testifying, you must remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When you are giving a testimony, try the best not to make a show.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord Jesus told us that the Pharisees always liked to make a show.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whatever they did, they did to be seen by men Matt 23:5a .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord also told us that whenever we fast, do not be as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disguise their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall repay you" Matt 6:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This shows us that we should not make a show in anything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we do, we are serving in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To love the Lord in incorruption is to love Him in the regenerated, renewed, and indwelt spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you do anything in your flesh, that is in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I believe that when Paul was writing the book of Ephesians and was giving a conclusion to his writing, he was filled with the feeling that whatever he taught in the preceding six chapters was all incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then he concluded that we have to love the Lord in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many Christians love the Lord concerning the church in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The organization and some of the practices of the denominations are corruptible things, since they are something of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If one loves the Lord and yet serves the Lord in the denominational way, this is in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>To love the Lord in incorruption we have to love the Lord according to everything revealed in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>At the end of Ephesians 1 is the church which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This surely does not refer to any religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The church is incorruptible, but the religious organizations are corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To stand on the proper ground is something incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>To take any other ground other than that of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ kept and expressed in each local church at its locality Rev 1:11 is to take the ground of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should not love the Lord in corruption; we should love Him in a pure way, in the way of incorruption that could stand forever.</S>

   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Paul does not conclude his Epistle by only saying, Grace be with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The condition for receiving the grace is that we love the Lord in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruption, that is, in a condition which is incorruptible.</S>
