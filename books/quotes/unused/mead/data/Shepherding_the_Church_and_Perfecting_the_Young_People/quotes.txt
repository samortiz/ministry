[1]  Shepherding the Church and Perfecting the Young People CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE HOW TO ADVANCE IN THE WORK THREE POINTS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION The Church Multiplying
[3]  Acts 9:31 says, The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.
[4]  We have peace, we are being built up, we fear the Lord, we have the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and we are praising God.
[5]  Some saints have said that the work in Taiwan has not developed in recent years because I spend most of my time in the United States.
[6]  The work needs leadership, but the co-workers cannot depend solely on the leadership.
[7]  The foundation has been laid, and churches have also been established in many places.
[8]  The co-workers in Tainan are free to develop the work in Tainan, but they must not interfere with the work in other churches.
[9]  A co-worker in Taipei must first fellowship with the co-workers and elders in Taipei regarding his service in a particular district, and then he should labor diligently.
[10]  Many new believers have not remained after being baptized, because we have not spent enough time to care for them.
[11]  The elders should charge the saints to come together to pray, fellowship, visit and recover the backslidden saints, strengthen the weak saints, comfort the disheartened saints, and lead people to salvation.
[12]  EVERYONE IN THE SMALL GROUP BEARING RESPONSIBILITY AND SERVING
[13]  In the small groups we should introduce the saints to spiritual books for their study and encourage them to fellowship mutually in the meetings.
[14]  About ten saints can gather together and use half the time to read and the other half to pray.
[15]  A group can use two evenings to visit saints or preach the gospel.
[16]  Although it is not appropriate for the elders to choke the workers so severely, the co-workers should be choke-proof.
[17]  A brother who serves in a locality should not stop doing something simply because he feels that the elders are not fully supportive.
[18]  The elders should not control him, but the brother should still be able to coordinate with the elders.
[19]  However, the elders should not direct him in his service, whether it is giving messages, working with young people, working on the campuses, or contacting saints.
[20]  If the co-workers have something, they will supply life in the meetings, and whenever they open their mouths, the saints will be enlivened.
[21]  First Peter 5:2-3 addresses the elders, saying, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing...according to God; not...as lording it over your allotments.
[22]  This means that the elders should shepherd and oversee the saints but not as lording it over the saints.
[23]  We should have the attitude of an overseer and let the saints handle things while we oversee the saints.
[24]  Elders Needing to Labor in the Word and Teaching
[25]  The Bible says that the elders should shepherd the flock of God.
[26]  First Timothy 5:17 says, Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
[27]  This verse says that the elders who lead well are those who labor in word and teaching.
[28]  An elder may say that he cannot speak the word because he has not received much training and does not know the Bible.
[29]  In order to be effective, a person must be burdened to work until a fire in the saints is kindled.
[30]  The elders should entrust the services to the saints and give them the authority to make decisions.
[31]  Suppose there are eight districts in a church, and the elders delegate the church affairs to the eight districts.
[32]  In the same way, the saints are in different districts and in small groups, but they are still the one church.
[33]  However, today the co-workers are not laboring in this way.
[34]  It seems that they pick up all the responsibilities of a local church; hence, they cannot leave that church.
[35]  In some places the co-workers replace not only the saints but also the elders.
[36]  When the saints are able to take care of things, we should leave the services completely in their hands.
[37]  In this way we will produce capable saints who function according to their ability, and every brother and sister will be useful.
[38]  This is not an increase in the number of churches, but it is a large increase in the number of saints, and the capacity of these new saints may be greater than the capacity of new ones gained in the towns and villages.
[39]  We should also put our energy into the schools.
[40]  In the beginning of the work in Taiwan there was a rapid increase in numbers, but after a period of time we seemed to have come to a stop, and no matter what we did, there was not much increase.
[41]  It is regrettable, however, that we have neither learned to bring the saints into the service nor learned to perfect the saints.
[42]  Then the elders who are older will not be so tired, because they will not be required to do as much; they will teach others and delegate many things to the younger saints.
[43]  THE OLD WAY REQUIRING A CHANGE OF THE SYSTEM
[44]  My burden is that the co-workers and elders must give some of their burdens to others.
[45]  Regardless of how hard they work, the co-workers and elders can bear only so much.
[46]  If the co-workers and elders have a change of concept, it will be easy to change the situation; otherwise, the work will come to a stop, and we will have problems.
[47]  However, they are not willing to allocate responsibilities to the saints or bring others into the service.
[48]  After studying this situation, we believe the basic problem is that the responsible saints are good but are unwilling to change and to teach other saints until everyone is brought into function.
[49]  Although there is no basis for elders retiring, in principle the older elders should be willing to reduce their responsibilities and bring the next generation, the middle-age saints, into the service according to their function.
[50]  In a church as large as the church in Taipei, the elders should bear the responsibility of supplying the saints with a message twice a week in the districts.
[51]  The responsibility of giving a message to feed the saints should not be borne by the responsible brothers in the districts.
[52]  The elders should endeavor to have a word with which to supply the church.
[53]  If everything is directed by the elders, the church will be limited, and many useful saints will not be utilized.
[54]  If the Lord were to scatter twenty-five hundred saints to fifty new places, there would be fifty saints in each place.
[55]  However, if we remain here for another five years, I am afraid that we will still have twenty-five hundred saints because that is our capacity.
[56]  Hence, unless we have the right view and are willing to change our concept and our system so that every saint fulfills his function, we will not be able to multiply to ten thousand or, much less, twenty thousand saints.
[57]  In the local churches where the elders are older and limited, the co-workers should begin to train and perfect new elders who can gradually take over the work of the elders.
[58]  During the years that I served in the church in Chefoo, I devoted my attention, my heart, and my time to the church.
[59]  We came together with these saints, not to discuss things but to study how to visit the other saints.
[60]  Furthermore, we must not allow our disposition to prejudice us toward others.
[61]  We must transcend our personal feelings, and we must spend time to observe the saints.
[62]  The co-workers, the elders, and the responsible ones in the districts and the other serving saints must not be afraid of the trouble or difficulties involved in perfecting the saints.
[63]  The senior elders will continue to serve as elders, but they should not limit or hinder the other saints.
[64]  Although for the past forty years we have emphasized preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, and leading them to pursue spirituality, we have been commissioned by the Lord to recover the testimony of the local churches.
[65]  Rather, the local elders should manage the affairs of a local church, and the co-workers should support the elders by helping and strengthening them in order to perfect the saints.
[66]  Even when we go abroad, we should not stay in a place for five days and then leave.
[67]  If our concept and our system are changed, staying in one place will not cause problems, because the responsibility for the work will be borne by the local brothers who are the elders, and the co-workers will help and strengthen the elders.
[68]  Our work for the Lord is to teach and perfect others, so we must have a change in concept.
[69]  We do not have secrets that we keep from the saints in fear of their excelling in the service and becoming better than us.
[70]  I am thankful to the Lord that when I first arrived in Shanghai, Brother Nee gave me many opportunities to learn.
[71]  For example, I had never done any literature work before that time, and neither had I been to his bookroom.
[72]  The saints and churches often wrote to Brother Nee asking him questions.
[73]  I hope that when the elders return to their respective localities, they will fellowship with the local saints so that the saints know the development and the line of the Lord s work.
[74]  THE NEED OF THE CHURCHES ABROAD HOLDING TRAININGS FOR
[75]  It would also be good to have a joint gathering or training every year or every other year for the saints from various local churches in Taiwan and abroad to attend.
[76]  The co-workers who go abroad to labor for the Lord should take note of the saints who are seeking and promising.
[77]  We must pay attention to a fundamental point in the young people s work, which is that we must bring them into working with us.
[78]  In every school we must produce young saints who are so burdened for the gospel that the work becomes theirs, and we only assist and supply them from a distance.
[79]  Perhaps a co-worker serves with a group of at least ten young saints who do not know how to meet when they come together.
[80]  The co-worker should instruct the young saints how to meet and if necessary should also supply them.
[81]  Even though he will spend much time and energy, none of the young saints will be able to serve; instead, they will support the co-worker with their presence.
[82]  However, the middle-aged or older saints do not always understand the psychology of the young ones.
[83]  We should not force the students to attend meetings.
[84]  There is no need to compel the students to join any meetings of the church; rather, we should work on them until it is their desire to attend the meetings.
[85]  WITH THE EFFECT OF LIFE HUMAN LIFE NEEDING PROPER RECREATION
[86]  We must help the young saints in this matter so that they do not think that in order to be good students they must spend all their time studying.
[87]  We must do a living work, and we must live in the spirit and in life.
[88]  This should not be merely a saying among us; it should be the way that we work.
[89]  In 1949 we began the work in Taiwan with a small number of saints.
[90]  There may be many reasons for our lack of increase, but the main reason is that the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones have not been able to perfect the saints.
[91]  The problem in the past has been that the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts served with those saints who matched their taste and not with those who were not according to their taste.
[92]  Presently, the saints are not being brought into function, but they are all gathering together.
[93]  Even if they try to do more and also preach the gospel, our number will not exceed three thousand saints, because all the service is in the hands of the co-workers and elders; that is, a few hens are occupying the roosts.
[94]  We do not bring the saints into function, because we unconsciously think that they are limited in their capacity but that we are not.
[95]  We do not pay enough attention to the saints growth in life.
[96]  The elders should be aware of their own growth in life, of the growth in life of the saints, and of the growth in life of the responsible ones.
[97]  This does not mean that the elders should invite the saints for fellowship or that the districts should have love feasts.
[98]  We should not assign one person to be in charge of giving messages, but a district with a regular attendance of four to five hundred saints needs the supply of a living word.
[99]  They can at least spend time before the Lord studying our publications, which contain many messages, so that they can present the word of the Lord to the saints in a fresh and living way.
[100]  Every week the elders and co-workers must supply the saints with the word so that the church can develop and be full of content.
[101]  In addition, the churches are not developing because the elders have not handed the services over to the saints, and the work is not advancing.
[102]  The Lord does not want us to be officials in the church or in the work; rather, He desires that we always supply life, just like air always fills a container.
[103]  We must change our concept, not be complicated, and supply life.
[104]  If we do not have the opportunity to speak in a meeting, we can still supply life through prayer.
[105]  If we change our concept, our disposition, and our way of doing things and then bring the saints into function, the number of saints will increase, and those in the meetings will also increase.
[106]  If a person continues year after year, he will graduate from college or even finish with a Ph.D. Many saints have not had their function developed.
[107]  The co-workers and elders consider the saints and feel that no one is capable; therefore, they do everything themselves.
[108]  Now we need to let go and let the saints serve so that they have the opportunity to learn.
[109]  Whether in meal service or giving hospitality, the saints take care of everything without being instructed by the elders.
[110]  However, if from the beginning of the work in Taiwan, I did not let the brothers serve, I would have annulled the function of many saints, and the churches would not have had much increase.
[111]  The elders should turn over the responsibility of a certain service to two or three saints who can train and instruct other saints.
[112]  ESTABLISHING THE CHURCH SERVICES LEARNING TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIRONMENT
[113]  The fellowship in this chapter is concerning the work and is mainly related to the brothers.
[114]  When a co-worker goes to serve in a locality, he wants the elders and the saints to hand everything over to him.
[115]  If the elders hold something back, the co-workers feel that they cannot work, because they are restricted.
[116]  This is the reason that the work does not have an effect among the saints.
[117]  The first kind of elder is elders in position only; they are limited by both their time and the extent of their burden.
[118]  The second kind of elders is those who are neither able nor willing to do things, but such elders often keep a tight hold on things in their hands.
[119]  They direct the saints and never delegate responsibilities to the saints.
[120]  In other words, such elders know how to do things, but they do not know how to perfect and oversee the saints.
[121]  Rather, he should consider the things that need to be done, consider the saints who can carry out the services, and encourage the delegation of these services to the saints.
[122]  However, the most basic work of the elders is to impart life to the saints; in order to do this the elders need to be desperate to have life themselves.
[123]  Although some saints love the Lord, they have little growth in life and limited experience and knowledge of Christ.
[124]  If most of the saints in a locality are progressing, the elder should not give ordinary messages or do an ordinary work.
[125]  However, if in every meeting the saints only release their spirit and there is no living word and no substantive supply in the word, the saints will not receive a solid supply from the meetings.
[126]  Rather, when a co-worker leaves a locality, there should be saints who have been raised up to replace him.
[127]  However, even among the co-workers who have been serving for twenty years, it is difficult to find a locality where the service has been built up for the saints to carry out their function.
[128]  Being Renewed and Not Holding On to Old Ways
[129]  We must spend time before the Lord in order to be renewed and not hold on to our old ways.
[130]  From 1967 to 1970 we did not make much progress.
[131]  The churches have been here for more than twenty years, and some elders and responsible ones are getting older.
[132]  The elders and responsible ones can continue to function behind the scene by praying, interceding, and caring for the saints and by supplying life.
[133]  They should also allow younger saints to handle the business affairs of the church.
[134]  It is not sufficient for the elders and co-workers to ask the saints to pray, pray-read, and release the spirit in the meetings.
