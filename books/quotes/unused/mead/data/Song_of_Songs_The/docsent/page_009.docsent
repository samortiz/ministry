   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE KING'S SPEAKING 1:8-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This maiden sees three things in the chambers: 1 She sees the blackness in Adam and the fairness in the Son of His love; 2 she sees the vanity of outward work through God's dealing; and 3 she also sees the spiritual need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, the Lord answers her according to her seeking, and He praises her and makes a promise to her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The King's Answer 1:8</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 8 says, "If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The King calls her "fairest among women."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"If thou know not" the tone of this sentence seems to indicate that the King is rebuking her and that she should have already known about such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, "the footsteps of the flock" signifies the footsteps of the believers today; these believers are taking the standing of one flock, that is, the standing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there are many sheep, they have not gathered as a flock, and they are not taking the standing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here one can find food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, the flock also signifies the saints who have died and have gone on before us throughout the past generations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have found food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can also find food and rest if we go to the place where they were.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "footsteps" means experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kids are not the sheep, because the maiden herself is a sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nor are they the flock, because she is outside of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kids are the lambs who are younger than she.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This reminds her not to forget her duty toward the kids in her daily life, as a result of her pursuit for food and rest, and not to lock up the gates of the kids.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is something to be watchful about.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While we are seeking after food and rest, we must still fulfill our duty toward immature disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot close the door and seek only our own edification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Putting it another way, she can derive her food and rest from feeding the kids!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "shepherds" is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the under-shepherds, those who are under the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "tents" is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord intends that she secure a place for herself beside all the other shepherds and feed the kids among them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, she has to follow the by-gone saints in their consecration, faith, endurance, trust, pursuit after God's will, dedication to prayer, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, in her daily life she must still care for those believers who are younger than she is, and she must fulfill her duty this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While we are pursuing, we must not give up our daily duties.</S>
