   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S FINAL MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose these three things are fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are they God's ultimate move?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is gospel preaching God's ultimate move?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is teaching the Bible God's ultimate move?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is meeting according to the Bible God's ultimate move?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is God's ultimate move?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is to gain a people who have Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must not have just a doctrine, but a real life in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must be our experience that Christ is the flowing life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As He saturates and permeates us, He supplies us with all His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection all these are carried out within us in this permeation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While His life is saturating us, it kills the negative things within us and supplies us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to know this, not just in a doctrinal way, but as a reality in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we need to know how to be transformed and how to grow into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, we must know by experience what it is to be built up, in order that Christ may have a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is not primarily after gospel preaching, nor Bible teaching, nor scriptural meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wants Christ as the embodiment of God to become your life, and you as a member of Christ to become a part of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Christ will have His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in every locality the Body will be expressed as a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the preparation of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 19:7 is yet to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is when "His wife has made herself ready" that "the marriage of the Lamb is come."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where among today's Christians is the bride being made ready?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you were to visit the different Christian meetings, you would realize how poor the situation is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am deeply burdened for you to see what God's ultimate move is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not think I have no earthly cares.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have a wife, children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law, and sons-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes I have to see a doctor for a physical problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yes, I have my share of troubles; that is part of my lot as a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But none of these is my real concern.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My real concern is how to present to the dear saints the Lord's ultimate move so that they may see it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have a burden within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where can the Lord get His heart's desire?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely not in the idol temples, nor in the Moslem mosques, nor in the Catholic cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even the proper gospel preaching, Bible teaching, and scriptural meetings have been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who cares about them?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And who cares about God's ultimate move to carry out His eternal intention?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who even knows what God's eternal intention is?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When there is an evangelistic campaign today, the sponsors often depend on their organizational methods, rather than the power which comes through prayer and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They advertise, they invite famous people to attend, and they ask the various denominations to band together to promote the campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way they are able to gather large crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Great numbers may respond.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a few years, however, what becomes of all these people?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consider all the campaigns that have been held these past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where are those who were supposedly saved in them?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, I rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, I mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where does the Lord have a way?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who are the people He can use?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What people on this earth afford Him a way?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must turn to the Lord and ask for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if our gospel preaching is adequate, our Bible teaching accurate, and our meetings scriptural, we still need to ask ourselves: Do we have the ultimate move of God among us?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE FOURTH STEP</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There must be a good number, not just a few, who truly know how wonderful a Person Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He must be our life, and we must live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be filled and permeated and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our entire being must be infused with His feelings, His thoughts, and whatever He is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must grow in life by being transformed little by little by His flowing life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we can be built up with our fellow-believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In our locality there will be a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The bride will be prepared for Him to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is this that the Lord is after today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I call it the fourth step.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For the first step, the spread of the gospel, God prepared the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For the second step, the return to the Bible, God prepared Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For the third step, the recovery of the gospel, the teaching of the Bible, and the proper meetings God in the last two centuries used Great Britain.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Finally, for the fourth step God has prepared the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All of the big points of human history match God's move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Actually, all the major events of human history were prepared by God for His move on this earth.</S>
