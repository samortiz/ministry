   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GATE AND THE WAY Issue No. 31 Scripture Reading: Matt 7:13-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My purpose today is not to expound Matthew 7:13-14 but to show the kind of way a Christian should take.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 5 through 7 is meant for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I will not delve, however, into the specific lessons that are intended for the Christians because this is not the purpose of my message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am only borrowing Matthew 7:13-14 as the theme of my message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two verses touch on two main principles: entering through the gate and walking on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is one extreme of emphasizing only entering and not walking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is another extreme of emphasizing only walking and not entering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has put before every Christian both a gate and a way; there is a way, and there is a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without these two things, the Christian life would be unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, what does it mean to enter a gate?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Entering a gate means passing through a barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gate has a door which acts as a barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you cross it you enter an area where you have not previously been.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how big the door may be, crossing and entering takes less than five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In an instant, you are through the crossing, and you will notice a clear difference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a big difference between the time before and the time after entering the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A few minutes ago you were in one world; a few minutes later you are in another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First you were outside the gate; now you are inside the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Entering the gate means experiencing a big difference within a short time; it means crossing the biggest barrier within the shortest time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this your situation becomes completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, outside the park all you see is dust and cars; however, once you cross the gate of the park, you immediately experience a different world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Christian must not only cross a barrier, but must also walk on a way before him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way is long and takes time to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Does entering the gate take much time?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, one step is all that is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Does it take more time to enter the gate or to walk on the way?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way takes more time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To enter the gate without walking on the way is not balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a person enters the gate, he has to advance step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To walk means to progress gradually and advance step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It only takes one step to enter the gate, but walking is not a one-step work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it takes a long time for one to walk step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a person enters a gate, he will notice an obvious difference.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Having crossed one barrier, it may take a hundred steps before he needs to cross another barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It may take another thousand steps before he needs to cross yet another barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The minute a person enters a gate, he has to begin walking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To enter a gate means to cross a barrier, and to walk on a way means to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today Christians have many arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One group emphasizes crossing barriers, another emphasizes making progress.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some consider entering the gate a super-experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others think that there is no need to enter a gate and that there is only a need to walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Walking on the way is surely a way of making progress, but this alone does not give one a clear separation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both groups have deviated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must recognize that we must cross the barrier and walk on the way; we must walk on the way as well as cross the barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Entering the gate and walking on the way are two great principles in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entering and the walking should receive equal attention from us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Bible, the spiritual pathway begins with an entry into a gate and is followed by a walk on a way; that is, it begins with the crossing of a barrier and is followed by a walk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is opposite to the way of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The pathway in the world involves first walking and then entering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, you have to walk on Hardoon Road before you can enter through the gate of Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the spiritual pathway is different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The spiritual pathway is more like a palace or an imperial burial ground; there is a huge wall, and a person has to go through a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then he has to walk a long way before he reaches his destination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible often mentions the gate and the way together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will take the two matters of faith and obedience to show you what is crossing the barrier and what is making progress.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is the principle by which we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition, there are two minor principles to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Faith is governed by these two minor principles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Faith is both a gate as well as a way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those with some spiritual experience know that faith has two aspects: believing and trusting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is a difference between the conduct of faith and the attitude of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our act of believing is the crossing of the barrier, while our continual trusting is the way of progress.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The one-time act of believing is what I call entering the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The subsequent sustaining of the attitude of faith is what I call walking on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a Christian wants to believe in God in a certain matter, he must first have a one-time specific act of believing; he must have a one-time genuine faith in God before he can walk on the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Passing a gate of faith is crossing a barrier of doubt, receiving a specific promise from God and believing specifically in such a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is to pass a barrier and enter through a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Please remember that a believer must first pass through the gate of faith before he can advance in faith, maintain an attitude of faith, and continually trust in God and walk the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many people think that simply maintaining an attitude of faith and trusting in God continually is all that is needed; they think that there is no need to have a specific act of faith initially or to pass a barrier of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But whoever does not enter the gate can never walk on the way, and whoever does not pass a barrier can never make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There must be a definite break with the past and then a definite acceptance of God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is entering through the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, there will never be spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Faith is entering through the gate and then walking on the way.</S>
