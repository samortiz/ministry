   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By the Transmission of Christ as the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be our power within.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we must come back to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can never and should never forget Philippians 1:19, which speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Christ were not the "electricity," how could He be the power to us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the electricity transmitted to us by the Spirit as the current.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The current, the transmission, of the electricity is the electricity itself, just as the circulation of blood is the blood itself flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the blood, there is no circulation, but we use the term circulation to describe the movement of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the transmission of the Lord, although in actuality the Spirit is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the Lord Himself were not the Spirit as the transmission, how could He be subjective to us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could we be in Him and He in us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus said, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only way to abide in Christ and for Him to abide in us is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason John 14 indicates that Christ was to be transfigured as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ could not abide in us and we could not abide in Him until the things mentioned John 14 were accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now Christ is the Spirit John 14:16-18; 2 Cor 3:17 , and as the Spirit He enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, we are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He and we, we and He, become a mutual abode; we abide in Him and He abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a matter entirely of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we repeat this vital point: We must know our spirit and realize the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For Christ to be our power and our secret is not an objective matter; it is one hundred percent subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we know Him in the spirit and as the Spirit, we will experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are impressed deeply with all of these points in the four sections of Philippians, this book will be very clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must take Christ as our life and our expression, our pattern and our example, our goal and our aim, and our secret and our power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we can do all things in Him who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is our secret.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are four wonderful books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we experience the Christ in Galatians and Philippians, we will know His Body in Ephesians; then we will realize Christ as the Head in Colossians.</S>
