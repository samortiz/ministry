   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2:2 Paul goes on to speak of all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The comforting of the heart must have a result.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this case the result is having all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to have such an assurance, for example, concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some saints claim to know the church ground and to be committed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, they are actually quite wishy-washy and have no certainty related to the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have faith, but they do not have the certainty which gives us full assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Allow me to testify of my experience about becoming assured regarding the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1932 we began to practice the church life in Chefoo, my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After several months, opposition rose up against us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we began to practice the church life, I was loved and respected by the Christian leaders in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They regarded me as one who was for the Lord Jesus in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the attitude of those leaders toward me began to change when more and more of the promising ones began to come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This troubled those Christian leaders, and negative rumors were circulated about us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, those who once respected me no longer greeted me when they saw me on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Deeply concerned about this, I went to the Lord and inquired about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I asked Him to show me what was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I spent more than a month thoroughly considering the matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually I concluded that if I were to be a man, I had to believe in the Lord Jesus; that if I were to believe in the Lord, I had to love Him; and that if I were to love Him, I had to take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, I received the full assurance concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had not only faith, but also the knowledge which caused me to have certainty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For more than forty-six years I have not changed my position with respect to the church ground, no matter how much I have suffered because of the stand I have taken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some co-workers who used to be close to me betrayed me because they were afraid to face opposition regarding the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of them had even given messages on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But actually they were wishy-washy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They did not have the full assurance of understanding that Paul speaks of in 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul realized that concerning the mystery of God, Christ, the believers needed certainty, the assurance that comes from faith and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who have such an assurance are not wishy-washy in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After making my decision about the ground of the church, I spent some time with Brother Nee in Shanghai during a period of turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Attempting to comfort him, I said, Brother Nee, I am one with you because you are taking the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I assure you, even if you turn from this way, I will not change my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have the full assurance concerning the Lord s way in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the full assurance of understanding that Paul speaks of in 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning Christ as the mystery of God, we need faith, knowledge, certainty, and thorough understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Colossians did not have the full assurance concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, they would not have turned to the worship of angels or taken in such things as observances, ordinances, and philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, they had received Christ and knew something about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, their knowledge of Christ was not with the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Colossians definitely believed in the Lord Jesus and held to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they did not have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They knew that Christ was the Son of God, and they had received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, because they were rather wishy-washy, they also accepted various observances, ordinances, and philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding concerning Christ as the mystery of God, every part of our being must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be wishy-washy in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am concerned for those in the Lord s recovery who have never exercised themselves in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Due to this lack of exercise, they may not have the full assurance of understanding concerning the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Certain ones were with us for years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While they were with us, they praised the Lord for His recovery and declared that they were absolutely for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But they eventually turned against the recovery and even condemned it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason for such a change is that they never had a thorough exercise concerning the Lord s recovery and never received the full assurance of understanding regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How much we need to be exercised to know Christ as the mystery of God!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should be able to say, Lord Jesus, apart from You I have no heart for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lord, my mind, will, and emotion are absolutely for You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I know what I believe, and I know what I am doing in Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am willing to lay down my life for You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I had ten lives, I would give every one of them for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every fiber of my being, Lord, is for You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you exercise your whole being in this way, you will have the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will not have any doubt about what you are doing or about the way you are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You will have the kind of assurance martyrs have when they lay down their lives for the Lord.</S>
