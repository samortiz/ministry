If we did not have a word from the Lord, we would not have any basis for our faith. The Lord&rsquo;s word produces faith. Faith, therefore, is based on the word of the Lord. What was the word given to the disciples by the Lord in this instance? It was the word, recorded in verse 22: &ldquo;Let us go over to the other side of the lake.&rdquo; Since the Lord had spoken this word, certainly He would fulfill it.</p><p>In 8:22-25 the disciples had not only the Lord&rsquo;s word but the Lord Himself. He was with the disciples in the boat. In that situation the disciples had the word of the Lord and the Lord Himself.</p><p>Since the disciples had both the Lord&rsquo;s word and His presence, they should have been at peace, not caring about the storm. The Lord had told them to go to the other side of the lake, and the Lord was with them in the boat. They should not have been frightened by the storm.</p><p>Our trouble as today&rsquo;s followers of the Lord is that when a storm comes we often forget the Lord&rsquo;s word. Furthermore, instead of looking at the Lord, we may look at the storm. We all need to learn that whenever we are on a journey following the Lord and a storm arises, we should look at the sleeping Lord and not at the storm. We should not care for the storm&mdash;we should care for the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord has said, &ldquo;Let us go over to the other side,&rdquo; and whatever He says will come to pass. Once the Lord speaks concerning a certain thing, it is settled. The Lord always fulfills His word. Hence, when He tells us to go over to the other side, we may be sure that we shall reach the other side, no matter what kind of storms may come.</p><h2 class="head2">Resting with the Lord</h2><p>We need to believe in the Lord and not look at our environment or circumstances. Instead of looking at the storm, let us look at the resting Lord. Which will you follow&mdash;the storm or the resting Lord? We may even want to say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, since You are resting, I shall rest with You. Let the wind blow. Because You are resting, I can rest with You.&rdquo; However, it is easy to say this, but it is difficult to practice it. As one who has been practicing for more than fifty years to look at the Lord and not at circumstances, I must confess that I am still learning this lesson.</p><p>Often in our journey with the Lord we shall encounter a storm or a whirlwind. Then we may become distracted and forget the Lord&rsquo;s word and the fact that He is with us and is at rest. Are you able to say, &ldquo;Lord, since You are resting, I shall rest also&rdquo;? Let us all learn to practice this.</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s account in 8:22-25 does not show a dispensational change; neither does it present the authority of the kingdom of God. Here Luke portrays the Christian journey. According to the portrait in Luke, while we are taking the way ordained by the Lord, the Lord will be at rest, and the enemy will be busy. The evil spirits and the demons will be active to cause storms to frustrate us on our journey. We need to remember that actually this is not our journey; it is the Lord&rsquo;s journey, and we are journeying with Him. We are taking His way, and He is on the way with us. In fact, He is even in the boat with us. We may say that the boat here signifies the church. For the Lord to be with us in the boat means that He is with us in the church. Although the &ldquo;boat&rdquo; of the church may be in the midst of a whirlwind and raging waters, we should not be troubled. Instead of being troubled, we should have peace in the resting Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CASTING OUT A LEGION OF DEMONS</h2><p>Eventually the Lord and His disciples reached their destination, &ldquo;the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee&rdquo; (8:26). Immediately they met a certain man who had demons (v. 27), a man possessed by a legion of demons (v. 30). The Lord cast out all these demons, giving them permission to enter into the many hogs that were feeding nearby (v. 32). &ldquo;And the demons, coming out from the man, entered into the hogs; and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned&rdquo; (v. 33). The picture in 8:22-39 corresponds to our spiritual experience. When we take the Lord&rsquo;s way, journeying with Him, there will be storms. Nevertheless, we eventually reach our destination on &ldquo;the other side of the lake.&rdquo; Then we shall see that in such a place the Lord casts out a legion of demons and clears up the unclean business of hog raising. In the Life-study of Mark we pointed out that the business of raising hogs signifies the unclean industry of today&rsquo;s world. In the world there are legions of demons, and everywhere there is unclean business. But wherever the followers of the Lord Jesus go with Him, the result will be that the demons are cast out and the business of hog raising is cleared up.</p><p>As indicated by the request of the multitude in the country of the Gerasenes that the Lord depart from them, the worldly people are offended when the demons are cast out and the business of hog raising is cleared up. It certainly is a good thing to cast out demons and to clear away the filthy business of hog raising, but this is not pleasing to worldly people. Although we are doing what is best for society, the people of the world do not appreciate us. Do not expect to be welcomed by worldly people. Because our journey will cause damage to their unclean business, we shall not be welcomed by them.</p><p>We have pointed out that demons dwell in the water. We may say that today&rsquo;s society is a huge lake of dirty water and that this water is full of demons. Wherever we go on our journey with the Lord, we shall meet legions of demons, and the demons will be cast out, and the unclean business will be removed. However, this is offensive to today&rsquo;s society. As a result, just as the Gerasenes begged the Lord to depart from them, the worldly people will ask us to go away from them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
