   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SINS, THE FRUIT OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of course, the Bible speaks both of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sins refer to trespasses, transgressions, and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, lying and stealing are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These sins are different from the sin that dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sins are deeds and activities, but sin is an evil element that dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin in the singular and the word sins in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sin is dealt with in the second section of Romans, 5:12 to 8:13 with the exception of 7:5, where sins are mentioned .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sins refer to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18 to 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the singular sin in 1 John 1:7 with the adjective all does not denote the indwelling sin, but denotes every single sin we have committed v. 10 , after we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND THE TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature Rom 7:17 , has been taken care of by Christ as our sin offering Lev 4; Isa 53:10; Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our sins, our trespasses, have been taken care of by Christ as our trespass offering Lev 5; Isa 53:11; 1 Cor 15:3; 1 Pet 2:24; Heb 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering, as indicated in 1 John 1:8, and as our trespass offering, as indicated in 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible reveals that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regarding this, 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God s righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the Lord was made sin for us, He condemned sin through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8:3 says, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that through the crucifixion of Christ, sin was condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, John 1:29 speaks of Him as the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world, and Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that Christ offered Himself for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we consider these four verses, we realize that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to deal with sin, the very sin that dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He became sin, He condemned sin, He took away sin, and He was an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as the offering for sin is typified by the sin offering in chapter four of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, we have not only the problem of sin in our flesh, but also the problem of the many sins we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have done many wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, instead of honoring our parents, we may have despised them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have committed many trespasses, transgressions, offenses, and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross to deal with our sin, He also bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Peter 2:24 says, Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse clearly indicates that Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul declares, Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, in Hebrews 9:28 we are told that Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By these verses we see that when the Lord was on the cross, He not only dealt with our sin, but also bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, He is both the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This implies that we received Him as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Receiving the Lord Jesus as our Redeemer includes receiving Him as both the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Often we say that the blood of Jesus cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This blood is the blood of the sin offering and of the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1:7 John speaks of the blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the blood of the Lord Jesus as both the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now that we have believed in Christ, we have Him as the Redeemer, the One who is our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, both sin and sins have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have been forgiven by God, and we have been washed, cleansed, by the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have pointed out, the blood of Jesus is the blood of the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all have believed in Christ and accepted Him as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
