 <h2 class="head1">HOW TO LEAD A MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Entering into Fellowship with the Lord<br />
before the Meeting</h2>
<p>The prerequisite of leading a meeting is that we must first enter into fellowship with the Lord. If we are not in fellowship with the Lord, a meeting will bring in burden and death. For example, if no one at a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting has entered into fellowship with the Lord, all of our elements of death will be combined when we are together, and the resulting death in the meeting will be unimaginable. We will bring in death if we have not entered into fellowship with the Lord before coming to a meeting. If this is the case, no one may have selected a hymn and no prayers may have been offered even five minutes after the scheduled time for the meeting to begin. This is altogether a dead situation. The Lord&rsquo;s table meeting is a real test to the condition of our spirit. If everyone&rsquo;s spirit is deadened and quiet in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, and no one has chosen a hymn or prayed, the responsible brothers may feel compelled to choose a hymn. But eventually, the more we sing, the more we will feel deadened and depressed. After the meeting someone might say, &ldquo;The meeting today was really poor; it was very bad.&rdquo; A young one might say, &ldquo;I am not coming next time.&rdquo; Who then is responsible for the meeting? We are all responsible. Hence, the prerequisite for leading a meeting is that we must all first enter into fellowship with the Lord. Then we can meet in the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>If we all meet in this way, the meetings will issue in life and the living Spirit. However, if we meet outside of the fellowship with the Lord, the meetings will bring in death. In a meeting of four hundred people, if there are forty who live in fellowship with the Lord, allow the Holy Spirit to operate in them, and serve as channels of the Holy Spirit, that meeting will be uplifted and enriched. In order to enter into fellowship with the Lord, we need to touch His presence through dealings, prayer, and fellowship with Him prior to our coming to a meeting. In this way we will be enlivened, and others will be affected. Some saints have learned to live in the Lord and in the Spirit. When they enter a meeting, they bring the Spirit and life to the meeting. Thus, we should never take the meetings lightly, thinking that we can come in a casual way without living in fellowship with the Lord. We need to know that the prerequisite of leading a meeting is to enter into fellowship with the Lord and then enter a meeting in the spirit of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Touching the Spirit of the Meeting</h2>
<p>Before we come to a meeting, we must enter into fellowship with the Lord. But once we enter a meeting, the first thing we must do is to touch the spirit of the meeting. For example, everyone at a wedding meeting is full of joy. But if two children are crying and making noise, some will say that they are not proper. Whenever we enter a meeting, we need to touch the atmosphere and spirit of the meeting in a spirit of fellowship. Every meeting, or every kind of meeting, has its spirit. If our spirit is living and sensitive, we will be able to touch the spirit of a meeting. For instance, we should not be singing, &ldquo;Praise Him! praise Him! praise the Savior!&rdquo; when we enter a memorial meeting. We should not be those who are without feeling or sensitivity. If the atmosphere of the meeting is sorrowful, we should be able to touch that spirit once we step into the meeting, and immediately feel sorrowful. Even if we were praising the Lord on our way to the meeting, once we enter into the mournful atmosphere of the meeting, our inner feeling should be sorrowful.</p>
<p>The problem with many saints is that they neither care for the spirit of the meeting nor touch the atmosphere of the meeting. It is as if whatever is happening in the meeting has nothing to do with them. They are all smiles while someone is weeping in prayer. They do not care for the spirit of the meeting; instead, they are concerned only for their feeling. For example, in a table meeting the spirit of the meeting may cause everyone to sense the Lord&rsquo;s dignity and greatness. Then a brother, unaware of the spirit and the atmosphere of the meeting, may select an irrelevant hymn as he enters the meeting. Because he has been singing and contemplating this hymn every day at home, he selects the hymn when he enters the meeting, regardless of the atmosphere of the meeting. He cares only for his feeling. Selecting hymns in this way is like laughing at a memorial meeting.</p>
<p>When we enter a meeting, we must touch the atmosphere, the spirit, of the meeting. We must put aside our personal feeling and be sensitive to touch the atmosphere of the meeting by the spirit of fellowship. We should do this in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, the prayer meeting, the fellowship meeting, and the meeting for the ministry of the word. For instance, we may have prepared a message to give in a meeting, but when we enter the meeting, we may touch an atmosphere that is not in line with the message we prepared. We should drop the original message and speak another message. Sometimes when we are talking with others, we must drop what we intended to say because the atmosphere is inappropriate. At that moment we need to observe the countenances of others, touch their feelings, and then speak accordingly. In conclusion, when we come to a meeting, we must exercise our living spirit within to touch the spirit and atmosphere of the meeting. Only when we have inwardly touched the atmosphere do we have anything to express, either by selecting a hymn or offering a prayer. We must always touch the feeling of a meeting with our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preparing Ourselves and Opening Our Spirit<br />
So That the Holy Spirit Has a Channel</h2>
<p>Before we come to a meeting we must enter into fellowship with the Lord. Then as we enter a meeting we must touch the spirit of the meeting. Furthermore, we must prepare ourselves and open our spirit so that the Holy Spirit can use us as a channel to speak for Him. However, some saints have made up their mind before coming to a meeting that they will not open their mouth, because they want only to attend a meeting and to listen to a message. They are determined to merely listen. This is because they think that the prayer meeting is for the praying ones to pray and the ministry meeting is for the ministering ones to minister; therefore, they come to listen. This is wrong. We should not have this kind of thought. We should open our spirit and allow the Holy Spirit to use us as a channel to speak for Him.</p>
