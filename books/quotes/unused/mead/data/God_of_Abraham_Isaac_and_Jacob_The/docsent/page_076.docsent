   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dwelling in Hebron</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 16 says, "And they journeyed from Bethel."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 27 says, "And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob had arrived in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once he reached this place, God's work in him was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From this point on, he dwelt in Hebron, the place where Abraham and Isaac once dwelt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meaning of Hebron is to remain in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was not only fellowship with God but fellowship with the other members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bethel was not the permanent dwelling place for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only Hebron was the permanent dwelling place of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we need to know Bethel as the house of God just as we need to know Shechem as the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we do not live in the knowledge of the house of God; we live daily in the fellowship of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time on, Jacob realized that he could do nothing on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything had to be done in fellowship, and nothing could be done outside of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the flesh is not dealt with, it will never see the importance of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians do not seem to need fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not need to fellowship with God, and they do not need to fellowship with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are this way mainly because their flesh has never been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The flesh must be dealt with, and one must know the life of Bethel before he realizes that he cannot live outside Hebron, and that he cannot survive without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fellowship we are speaking of refers to the life supply of Christ which comes from the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When other brothers and sisters supply us with the indwelling Christ and we go forward through the supply of these other members, we have Hebron and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's children are very much in need of this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God's children have not been dealt with in their flesh, they cannot know the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may understand the doctrine about the Body of Christ, and they may even be able to expound it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if their flesh is not dealt with, they will not know the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the flesh is dealt with, they will know the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will see the importance of fellowship, and they will not be able to live apart from the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will not be able to be a Christian at all without the other children of God, and they will not be able to receive any supply of life apart from the help of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, the Body of Christ is a fact; it is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot live without Christ, and we cannot live without the other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to ask God to show us that we cannot be Christians by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to live in fellowship with God, and we have to live in fellowship with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May God lead us on so that we can truly glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May God gain not only a vessel in Jacob, but a vessel in us as well.</S>
