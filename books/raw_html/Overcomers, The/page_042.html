<h2 class=head2>H. To Consummate and Complete the New Jerusalem in Full, as the Tabernacle of God and the Wife of Christ in the New Heaven and New Earth for Eternity</h2><p>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be consummated and completed in full, as the tabernacle of God and the wife of Christ in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-10). In the kingdom of one thousand years, the New Jerusalem will be composed only of the overcomers. Besides the overcomers there will be a great number of immature saints, but after the thousand-year kingdom, all the believers will be matured. The Lord has a way to cause all the believers to be matured. If we do not get matured in this age, we will be matured in the next age. The process of being matured in the next age, however, will be very severe. Eventually, all of the believers will join the overcomers to make the New Jerusalem larger than it was in the thousand-year kingdom. That will consummate and complete the New Jerusalem in full, as the tabernacle of God and the wife of Christ in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.<p>In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the wife of Christ. On the wedding day, the wife is the bride, but after the wedding day she is no longer the bride but simply the wife. The believers who do not overcome in this age will participate in the New Jerusalem as the wife, but they will have no share in her as the bride because they will mature too late. The New Jerusalem in eternity future will be with the addition of all the saints perfected for their maturity in the divine life through the discipline in the kingdom age (Rev. 21:2, 12, 14). This will be for the eternal expression, to its fullest extent, of the processed Triune God in, with, and through all the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite saints in eternity (Rev. 21:10-11).<h2 class=head2>I. To Consummate Finally the Triune God’s Eternal Economy in Christ through the Consummated Spirit</h2><p>The overcomers will consummate finally the Triune God’s eternal economy in Christ through the consummated Spirit. This is proven by Revelation 22:17—“The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” The bride is the overcomers, and the Spirit is the consummated Triune God. This is the ultimate consummation of the entire economy of God, and this consummation is the glorified saints married to the processed and consummated Triune God.<h2 class=head2>J. To Participate in the Fullest Enjoyment of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</h2><p>The overcomers will participate in the fullest enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God in the fellowship with all the redeemed and glorified saints forever and ever. In the thousand-year kingdom, the overcomers will be happy, but they will no doubt miss their spiritual relatives, the other brothers and sisters in Christ. But after the one thousand years, all the believers will be matured to be included with the overcomers as the New Jerusalem for eternity. Then we will enjoy the Triune God in fellowship with all the saints throughout the ages as the New Jerusalem forever to be in His glory as His expression for His satisfaction. In this chapter we have seen the New Jerusalem. Our “dream” is to become the New Jerusalem as the final consummation of the overcomers and the consummation of God’s economy.
