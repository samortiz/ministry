   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GLORY IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 17 the time was at hand for the Lord Jesus to die and then be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Resurrection, you may not realize, is simply the full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is small and inconspicuous, yet within this tiny seed the blossom is concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as it stays where we can see it, there is no blossom, that is, no glory, to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If, however, we sow the seed into the soil and it dies, it will grow up and then blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blossom is the release of the hidden glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blossoming of the carnation is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus was a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was a despised Nazarene with no beauty that we should desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That seed, however, concealed the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He was about to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then He would be raised from the dead, and the divine glory would be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ, in other words, would be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The glory released in the resurrection was the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the Son to be glorified meant that the Father too was glorified, because the Father was concealed in the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the glory shone forth, both the Son and the Father alike were glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How, then, could the Son of God be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How could the Father be glorified in the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was by the Son's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Son was glorified, that glory was the Father expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So the Lord prayed, "Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be glorified, then, is to have the divine nature expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Dear saints, we are touching something which human language cannot adequately express; I sense that I am short of utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I look to the Lord that you may see what I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GLORY IN FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many plants, after they blossom, bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blossom is a temporary expression; it is followed by the fruit, which is more lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In my home province in north China there were many apple groves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What interested us was not so much the blossoming of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Year by year we eagerly anticipated the month of September, when the trees would be laden with fruit!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We greatly enjoyed going to see these apple trees in their glorification!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even while we were still far away, we could smell the fragrance of the apples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The aroma was so sweet that we would store some apples in with our clothing for the next few months so that their fragrance would permeate our clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is Christ in His glorification more like the carnation flower or like the apple tree?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is like the apple tree!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fruit He has borne is even more fragrant and beautiful than the blossom!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are this fruit!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Christ had never produced a disciple after His resurrection, He would have remained a carnation blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After His resurrection, however, there were one hundred twenty in Jerusalem Acts 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then three thousand were added 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before long there were five thousand 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now throughout this whole earth there are "apple groves" which have issued from Christ's resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From Europe to Africa to North and South America and all the way to the Far East are spread these apple groves, expressing and glorifying the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A church is simply an apple grove, bearing the fruit of the resurrected Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord Jesus as the Son of God is glorified by our thus expressing Him, the Father is also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What the Lord Jesus was praying that night in John 17 was for the proper church life, with all His disciples expressing Him the way apples express the apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are His apples, expressing Him in resurrection that the Father may be glorified!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The proper church life, in other words, is the glorification of the Son and of the Father, the glorification of the Father in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's prayer, "Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You," is fulfilled in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we understand this first verse, then we can come to some understanding of this whole prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord goes on to pray four times for the oneness of all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>1 "Holy Father, keep them in Your name that they may be one even as we are" v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>2 "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us" v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>3 "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one" v. 22 .</S>
