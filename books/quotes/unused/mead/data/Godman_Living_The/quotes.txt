[1]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE ONE BORN OF GOD THROUGH REGENERATION Scripture Reading: John 3:16; Eph 1:5, 9; Gen 1:26; Prov 20:27; Gen 2:7; Eccl.
[2]  3:11; Gen 2:9; 3:24; John 14:6; Heb 10:19-20; John 1:1-5, 11-13; 3:6b, 3, 5 OUTLINE God so loved the world that He gave them His only begotten Son, that they may receive Him by believing into Him to have the eternal life the divine life John 3:16.
[3]  His good pleasure is to be one with man and make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in His Godhead Eph 1:5, 9.
[4]  In this series of messages we want to see the God-man living.
[5]  This God-man living is the eight major items of Christ s organic saving: regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, conformation, and glorification.
[6]  To touch the God-man living means to touch these eight major items.
[7]  The way for man to contact God as the tree of life was closed due to man s fall by God s glory, signified by the cherubim, God s holiness, signified by the burning flame, and God s righteousness, signified by the slaying sword Gen 3:24 .
[8]  These ones are born not of blood the physical life , nor of the will of the flesh the will of fallen man after man became flesh , nor of the will of man the will of the man created by God , but of God, who is the source of life and the fountain of life v. 13 . God is the source of life.
[9]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE TWO UNDER THE ORGANIC FEEDING AND SHEPHERDING OF CHRIST AS THE GOOD SHEPHERD Scripture Reading: John 11:25; 14:6; 10:10b-11, 14, 16; 21:15-17; Eph 4:11-13; 1 Pet 5:4; Heb 13:20; 1 Pet 2:25, 2; 1 Cor 3:2; Heb 5:13-14; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 5:29; Col 1:28; Eph 6:17; 1 Cor 12:11; Eph 4:4; 1 Pet 5:2; Acts 20:28 OUTLINE The Gospel of John, as the gospel of life, unveils to us that Christ is not only life 11:25; 14:6 for Him to be life to us that through Him we may be regenerated by God, but also a good Shepherd 10:10b-11, 14, 16 who feeds and shepherds us as His flock.
[10]  After their spiritual birth, as newborn babes, the believers need the feeding and the shepherding of Christ, as He charged Peter, His first apostle, to take care of the believers as His lambs and sheep by feeding and shepherding them John 21:15-17.
[11]  In the church life Christ as the Head distributes His gifts to the mature ones, among whom are the shepherds, for the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12.
[12]  The believers growth in the divine life is by feeding on the word of God, which is also the Spirit of God Eph 6:17 , and the manifestation of the believers functions in the Body of Christ is also by the Spirit 1 Cor 12:11 ; hence, the feeding of Christ is related eventually to the Spirit who is altogether for the Body of Christ Eph 4:4 to consummate the ultimate goal of God s eternal economy.
[13]  In Song of Songs the Lord instructs His lover to go to the place where He pastures His sheep by following the footsteps of His flock 1:7-8 .
[14]  Later, He also pastures His flock among the lilies, that is, among those who seek the Lord and live a life of trusting in God with a pure heart 2:16; 6:3 .
[15]  The shepherds feeding is not only for the growth unto the believers daily salvation but also unto their maturity in the divine life which is needed for the God-men to be built up in the Body of Christ Heb 5:14; Eph 4:12-13 .
[16]  FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 2:7-16; Matt 2:1-23; Luke 2:21-24; Col 2:11; Luke 2:25, 34-35, 40, 49, 52; 3:23; Isa 53:2-3; 52:14; Heb 4:15b; 2:18; Num 4:3 OUTLINE In His infancy: Lying in a manger Luke 2:7-16.
[17]  Growing to be strong, filled with wisdom referring to His deity , and the grace of God referring to God s grace in His humanity being upon Him Luke 2:40.
[18]  Early, at the age of twelve, the first God-man was in the things of His Father, that is, in the things concerning His Father s house, which is the church issuing in the Body of Christ, which will consummate the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God s eternal economy.
[19]  In this message we want to see the first God-man s living.
[20]  Many of us know the term God-man, but we need to be able to give a clear portion in the New Testament where this God-man is mentioned.
[21]  This verse implies the God-man because the Word refers to God Himself who became a man in the flesh.
[22]  The Lord s infancy shows two things: His lying in a manger Luke 2:7-16 and His fleeing from His opposers.
[23]  IN HIS SILENCE BETWEEN THE AGE OF TWELVE AND THE AGE OF THIRTY A. Growing Up like a Tender Plant before Jehovah and like a Root out of Dry Ground
[24]  The Lord s being a root out of dry ground Isa 53:2a meant that He came from a poor family.
[25]  FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 3:13-17; 21:32; John 1:14; Rom 1:3-4; 8:3; Matt 12:17-19; Heb 1:9; Matt 4:1-11 OUTLINE In His ministry: The commencement of the first God-man s ministry for the accomplishing of God s eternal economy: Through His baptism by John the Baptist Matt 3:13-17: To fulfill the righteousness according to the way of righteousness brought in by John v. 15; 21:32.
[26]  In sending His Spirit to descend upon Him, indicating that the Triune God would be one with Him as the source, supply, power, and authority of His ministry.
[27]  His temptations: At the beginning of His ministry Matt 4:1-11: A temptation under the leading of the Holy Spirit of God arranged by God for the God-man to be tested before His assuming of His ministry v. 1a.
[28]  1b-10: 1 The devil, based upon God the Father s saying in His anointing to the God-man that He was God s beloved Son, tempted Him to make a show of Himself being the Son of God for His self-exaltation and self-glorification and to do a miracle to bid the stones to become loaves of bread for His hunger, but the God-man defeated him by not making a show of Himself and not caring for the loaves of bread but for every word of God vv.
[29]  2 Again, the devil, based upon God the Father s saying that the God-man was His beloved Son, tempted the God-man to jump from the wing of the temple so that God would command His angels to bear Him up, but the God-man overcame him by telling him that it is written, You shall not test the Lord your God vv.
[30]  In this initial fighting for God s economy, the first God-man won the war for the glory of God, and the angels of God came triumphantly and ministered to the God-man, taking care of His forty-day fasting hunger v. 11b.
[31]  Matthew 3:13 through 4:11 reveals how the Lord began to live in His ministry, which commenced when He was thirty years old Luke 3:23 .
[32]  When He became thirty, God established Him to carry out His ministry for the purpose of accomplishing God s eternal economy.
[33]  Recognizing That, according to His Flesh, He Was Good for Nothing but Death and Burial
[34]  The Lord Jesus recognized that according to His flesh His humanity John 1:14; Rom 1:3; 8:3 He was good for nothing but death and burial.
[35]  His anointing by God the Father declared to the whole universe, particularly to the angels, that according to the Spirit of holiness His divinity Rom 1:4 He is the Son of God, the Beloved of the Father, in whom is the Father s delight.
[36]  with the Kingdoms of the World and Their Glory
[37]  The devil took the God-man to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and said to Him, All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me, but the God-man conquered him by not loving the worldly kingdoms and their glory and saying to the devil, Go away, Satan!
[38]  For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve 4:8-10 .
[39]  Knowing that God wanted to destroy him by the man, in his flesh, that is, in his humanity, whom he had poisoned and spoiled, Satan took the strategy of tempting the first God-man to assume that He was the Son of God, standing far off from the position of His humanity.
[40]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE FIVE A WORD OF DEFINITION 1 OUTLINE The way of righteousness:
[41]  The Old Testament dispensation of law ended at the commencement of the first God-man s ministry: The law of the Old Testament dispensation charged man to do good according to the law that man might be justified by God according to His law Lev 18:5 , yet men sought to establish their own righteousness, not subject to the righteousness of God Rom 10:3, 5.
[42]  The outcome of the law was that man was exposed to be sinful before the righteous God Rom 4:15; 5:20; Gal 3:19 and no man of the flesh could be justified by God Rom 3:20 .
[43]  In this message we want to give a word of definition concerning the way of righteousness and concerning the proper and righteous base of Jesus baptism.
[44]  When I was young, I wondered why the Lord Jesus, who was not a sinner, needed to be baptized.
[45]  Furthermore, after He died judicially for these repentant people, Christ resurrected to live within them that they may live by Christ s life, a life of righteousness to be justified by God all the time.
[46]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE SIX A WORD OF DEFINITION 2 OUTLINE The devil s first stratagem in tempting the first God-man to ignore His human status of being a man Matt 4:3-4: In His anointing the first God-man, God declared that He was His beloved Son Matt 3:17.
[47]  But the first God-man defeated His tempter by standing firmly in His position of a man and answering him by saying, Man shall not live..., insisting to indicate that He was a man Matt 4:4.
[48]  The devil s second stratagem in tempting the first God-man to assume His divinity of being the Son of God Matt 4:5-7: Again, it was based upon what God declared the first God-man was.
[49]  But the first God-man overcame His subtle tempter by saying, You shall not test the Lord your God, indicating strongly that He was a man before God who should not test the Lord His God.
[50]  God in His eternal economy wanted to have a man as one of His creatures to deal with His enemy Satan, another creature, but the enemy tempted the first God-man to assume His divinity as the Creator of all things.
[51]  The devil s third stratagem in seducing the first God-man to love the glory of the kingdoms of the world, worshipping him as God and serving him as his subordinate Matt 4:8-11; Luke 4:5-8: It should have been that in the preadamic age, God appointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age Ezek.
[52]  In the previous message, we saw the definitions of the way of righteousness and the proper and righteous base of Jesus baptism.
[53]  Jesus received the baptism by John the Baptist, standing on the base of realizing that He was a man in the flesh.
[54]  Romans 8:3 says that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He was still in the flesh, which in the eyes of God is altogether condemned, rejected, and worthy only of death and burial.
[55]  Before the Lord Jesus began to do anything for His ministry, the first thing He did was to come to John to receive such a baptism to declare to the whole universe that He did not depend at all upon the flesh for God s ministry.
[56]  The tempter said to Jesus, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone v. 6 . This was a temptation enticing Jesus to show that as the Son of God He was able to act miraculously.
[57]  FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 22:15-46; 26:57-68 OUTLINE In His ministry: His temptations: During His ministry Matt 22:15-46: The tempter s intention to ensnare Him in His words v. 15.
[58]  When they showed Him, He asked them whose image and inscription were on the coin; they answered, Caesar s. He answered them, Render then the things that are Caesar s to Caesar and the things that are God s to God.
[59]  In the previous message we saw the devil s stratagems in tempting the Lord at the beginning of His ministry.
[60]  In this message we want to see the temptations suffered by the Lord during His ministry and at the end of His ministry.
[61]  e. The First God-man Turning the Test to Them
[62]  All those who tested the Lord were defeated, muzzled.
[63]  FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS 4 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:8; Matt 11:28-29; 12:16, 19-20; 9:36; 11:5; Luke 4:18-22; John 11:35; Luke 9:58, 53-56; Isa 53:3, 7; 1 Pet 4:1; 2:21-23; Luke 23:34a, 42-43; Heb 2:18; 4:15; John 5:19, 30; 8:28; 14:10; 6:38; Matt 26:39, 42; John 7:6, 8; 1 Tim 3:16a OUTLINE In His ministry: His living for His ministry: Based upon the significance of the water baptism: Realizing that a man in the flesh is good for nothing but death and burial.
[64]  Thus far, we have seen the first God-man s living in His infancy, in His youth, and in His silence between the age of twelve and the age of thirty.
[65]  nor Making Anyone Hear His Voice in the Streets
[66]  Matthew 12:19 and 20 say, He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
[67]  In His crucifixion He prayed for those who were crucifying Him, that the Father would forgive them their sin of ignorance Luke 23:34a .
[68]  FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS 5 Scripture Reading: Matt 3:16; Heb 1:9; Acts 10:38a; Luke 4:18-19; Matt 12:18a; 4:1-2; Luke 4:1; John 3:34; Acts 10:38b; Matt 12:18b, 28; Rev 1:5; 3:14; 1 Tim 3:16; Heb 9:14 OUTLINE In His ministry: His moving for His ministry: Under the Spirit s anointing: After He was baptized in the water, God anointed Him with the Spirit descending upon Him as a dove Matt 3:16.
[69]  Anointed by God with the oil of exultant joy above His partners Heb 1:9.
[70]  Now that we have seen the living of Christ for His ministry, we want to go on to see His moving for His ministry.
[71]  A MAN OF PRAYER 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 3:12-14, 8; John 10:30; Acts 10:38c; John 8:29; 16:32; 1 Pet 2:23b; Luke 23:46; John 14:30b; Matt 3:13 4:11; 6:5, 16; 17:21; Acts 13:2-3 OUTLINE A man of prayer: Not as a common man praying common prayers to God.
[72]  The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: After His baptism in the water, and God s anointing from the heavens with the great commission for Him to bring in the kingdom of the heavens to the earth, He, under the leading of the Spirit, went to the wilderness to fast forty days and forty nights Matt 3:13 4:11: He should have felt that: His Father s divine commission to Him concerning the kingdom of the heavens was a great and critical burden to Him.
[73]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the first God-man s living by seeing Him as a man of prayer.
[74]  He did not live as a common man praying common prayers to God, as a pious man, a so-called godly man, praying to God in a religious way, or as a God-seeking man praying to God for the divine attainments and obtainments.
[75]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE ELEVEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[76]  A MAN OF PRAYER 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 6:5-18; 7:7-8 OUTLINE The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: In His supreme teaching on the mount, the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens taught His disciples twice concerning prayer: The first time is in the central part of His supreme teaching, unveiling to His disciples the heavenly vision concerning the prayer which is critical to the kingdom life, with four negative charges as warnings Matt 6:5-18: The prayer: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.
[77]  We want to continue to see the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man, who was a man of prayer.
[78]  His mystical human life was a divine realm, and this realm is the kingdom of God.
[79]  This means that the Triune God prays with us and that we pray by living with the Triune God.
[80]  Today the world is not God s kingdom but His enemy s kingdom.
[81]  the Power, and the Glory Belong to the Father Forever
[82]  A MAN OF PRAYER 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 9:36 10:4; 11:25-30 OUTLINE The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: He taught His disciples to pray concerning the harassed and cast-away sheep of God Matt 9:36 10:4: The first God-man as the Shepherd of God s elect, seeing that God s elect were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd and being moved with compassion, charged His disciples to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest 9:36-38.
[83]  Then He sent His twelve disciples, who were appointed by Him as the twelve apostles, and gave them authority to cast out unclean spirits and heal all kinds of diseases 10:1-4.
[84]  In Luke s parallel record of this case, we are told that the Lord Himself went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[85]  In this message we want to cover two examples of prayer uttered by the Lord Jesus, the first God-man.
[86]  The first God-man, after reproaching the surrounding cities for not being willing to receive His teaching and repent Matt 11:20-24 , prayed to the Father, and based upon His prayer, He gave a wonderful teaching to His disciples vv.
[87]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[88]  The Lord s surpassing prayer and His unveiling teaching in Matthew 11:25-30 are regarding four major items: regarding God s eternal economy, regarding God s pleasant will, regarding the first God-man as the Head of the Body, the prototype, and the model, and regarding His believers as the members of His Body, His mass production, and His duplication.
[89]  The mass production is from the prototype, and the duplication is from the model.
[90]  God s eternal economy is seen in Matthew 11:27, where the Lord says, All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
[91]  The Father has delivered all His elect to the Son for the building up of the Son s Body v. 27a; John 6:37, 44, 65; 17:6b; 18:9 . God the Father has given all His chosen ones to the Son, not for them to go to heaven or merely for their salvation but for the building up of the Body of Christ.

[93]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[94]  A MAN OF PRAYER 5 Scripture Reading: Matt 14:19, 23 OUTLINE The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: In the performing of the miracle of feeding five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, He trained His disciples to learn from Him Matt 11:29 that: Before performing the miracle, He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven indicating that He looked up to His Father in heaven , and blessed them Matt 14:19 , indicating that: As the Son on earth sent by the Father in heaven, He was one with the Father, trusting in the Father John 10:30.
[95]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Lord s pattern as a man of prayer in the record of Matthew.
[96]  The Lord did not seek His own will but the will of Him who sent Him John 5:30b .
[97]  After performing the miracle, the Lord went up to the mountain privately to pray Matt 14:23; cf.
[98]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[99]  A MAN OF PRAYER 6 Scripture Reading: Matt 15:36-39; 17:19-21; 18:15-22; 19:13-15 OUTLINE The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: In the performing of the miracle of feeding four thousand people with seven loaves and a few small fish Matt 15:36-39 , He trained His disciples again to learn from Him that: Before performing the miracle, He gave thanks Matt 15:36 , indicating that: He honored His Father as the source of the supply of the people s necessities, standing on the position of One sent by His Father.
[100]  He trained His disciples to give thanks to God the Father for their necessities and in everything 1 Thes 5:18; Eph 5:20 .
[101]  We have seen from Matthew 11 that the Lord Jesus told us we have to learn from Him v.
[102]  G. Answering His Disciples Question concerning Why They Were Not Able to Cast Out a Demon 1.
[103]  The disciples could not succeed in attempting to cast out a demon, so they asked the Lord why this was so.
[104]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[105]  The nation of Israel lost her capacity in fulfilling God s economy because of her rottenness.
[106]  Because their condition of not bearing fruit but having only leaves still remained after the first God-man s ministry among them, God intended to give them up Matt 21:33-43.
[107]  At this juncture, the first God-man cursed her to dry up, according to God s will in fulfilling His economy Matt 21:19.
[108]  The first God-man s prayer here, like all His prayers in the synoptic Gospels, was prayed by Him in His humanity; this prayer here, made by Him when He was exceedingly sorrowful and deeply distressed, corresponds with the one in Paul s writing in Hebrews 5:7 in which He offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears, asking God to save Him out of death.
[109]  We have been fellowshipping concerning the prayers of the first God-man made by Him in His humanity as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens.
[110]  All the prayers offered by the Lord in Matthew, Mark, and Luke the synoptic Gospels were made by Christ in His humanity.
[111]  This prayer was offered by the Lord after His discourse in John 14 through 16 concerning the union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people.
[112]  Based upon this background, the first God-man taught His disciples to pray for executing God s will according to His economy by faith Matt 21:21-22 .
[113]  The Lord told them to ask God that their flight would not be in winter nor on a Sabbath Matt 24:20 .
[114]  THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE FIRST GOD-MAN S LIVING
[115]  A MAN OF PRAYER 8 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:20-30, 36-46; Luke 23:33-34; Matt 27:46; Luke 23:46 OUTLINE The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God s salvation: In His prayer in Gethsemane before He was arrested, judged, and sentenced to be crucified, He prayed and taught His disciples to learn from Him how to pray Matt 26:20-30, 36-46: He taught His disciples how to watch and pray: He came to His disciples and found them sleeping.
[116]  Matt 27:46: Christ s crucifixion lasted for six hours from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Mark 15:25; Matt 27:45 . In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 . In the last three hours of His crucifixion God had caused our iniquity to fall on Him Isa 53:6 and made Him sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 , so God left Him at that juncture.
[117]  According to John s record in the mystical view concerning Christ in His divinity, God the Father with Him and the Spirit as the Triune God are always one essentially, coexisting and even coinhering; this is what is called the essential Trinity; whereas according to the record of the synoptic Gospels in the physical view concerning Christ in His humanity, God the Father left Him economically when He was made sin for us on the cross; this is what is called the economical Trinity.
[118]  Many readers of the Bible feel that in studying the four Gospels, the easiest thing to study is Christ s prayer.
[119]  It is difficult to reconcile this portion of the Word with what the Lord said in John concerning God the Father s always being with Him as God s sent One 16:32; 8:16, 29 .
