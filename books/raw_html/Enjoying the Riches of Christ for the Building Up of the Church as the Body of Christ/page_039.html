<h2 class=head1>GROWTH IN LIFE REVEALED IN MATTHEW 13</h2><p>The growth in life is revealed in Matthew 13. In this chapter the Lord Jesus told us that He came not as a teacher but as a Sower to sow Himself as the seed of life into us (vv. 3-8). This is very meaningful. We must drop the concept that we can be wonderful, spiritual Christians by collecting knowledge. We must be revolutionized in our concept. The Lord came as a Sower, and He sowed Himself into us as the seed of life. According to Matthew 13, after this sowing, we all need to grow.<p>The first parable in Matthew 13 reveals the sower (vv. 3-8). In the second parable the seed sown grows up into wheat (vv. 24-30). Then the fourth parable refers to fine flour (vv. 33-35). Fine flour comes from the grains of wheat. These grains are good for making a loaf, and this loaf signifies the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). We are many members yet one Body, one bread.<p>In the fifth and sixth parables a treasure is hidden in a field, and a merchant finds a pearl of great value (vv. 44-46). In principle, the treasure hidden in the field must be composed of gold and precious stones, items which are transformed substances. These transformed items are the materials for building the house of God (1 Cor. 3:12). This is very meaningful. For the producing of the church we need growth and transformation. Then we can have the building. The growth is for transformation, and transformation is for building.<h2 class=head1>GROWTH IN LIFE BY FEEDING, NOT BY TEACHINGS</h2><p>Many in Christianity hold the wrong concept that teachings are needed for growth in life. Christianity cares too much for teachings. Satan is very subtle. In fundamental Christianity he has used dead teachings to cover people’s eyes. Teachings upon teachings are like layers upon layers covering people’s eyes. The more they study theology, commentaries, and expositions, the more they are blinded, covered, and veiled. More than thirty years ago I had many layers of veils over my eyes. It took more than fifteen years for all the veils to be removed. To grow in life we need feeding. Regardless of how much we teach others to grow, no growth will take place. Teaching does not help the growth, but feeding does. We must help the brothers and sisters to eat and drink.<p>Ephesians 4:14 says, “Tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching.” It does not say by the “wind of heresy” but by the “wind of teaching.” This teaching is not false doctrine but good, sound, scriptural, and fundamental doctrine. It is doctrine as wind that carries people away from the Body, from the church, and from the Head, Christ. In the Lord’s recovery He has released us and freed us to come back to Himself and to His Body. Now in the church I am so happy. Forty years ago I was distracted by knowledge, but praise the Lord, now I am liberated and recovered! I do not care for mere doctrine. I only care for Christ and the church, for the Head and the Body.<h2 class=head1>THE GIFTS NOT HELPING US TO GROW IN LIFE</h2><p>The exercise of the gifts does not help our growth in life. Some people consider that we need gifts such as divine healing, but for a person to receive divine healing will not help him to grow in life. Some using 1 Corinthians 14:4 say that tongue-speaking edifies people. However, if we check into the tongue-speaking practiced today, much of it is not genuine. Some people lay hands on others, telling them to say, “Praise Jesus,” quickly over and over, or to speak nonsensical syllables. To be honest, this kind of speaking in tongues does not help people to grow.
