<p>Christianity&rsquo;s belief in organization is based on the apostles&rsquo; appointing seven men to serve tables. The Chinese term for <em>organization</em> does not necessarily imply hierarchy, but in English the term <em>hierarchy</em> is often associated with religious organizations. The development of hierarchy among believers began in the second century when Ignatius, a Bible expositor, erroneously taught that elders and overseers are two different groups of people. This teaching led to the establishing of hierarchy among the believers. In Acts 20:17 Paul called for the elders of the church in Ephesus. In verse 28 he said, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo; This indicates that <em>elders</em> and <em>overseers</em> refer to the same people. <em>Elder</em> denotes a person&rsquo;s condition; he is a person who is somewhat mature. <em>Overseer</em> denotes the function and responsibility of an elder, which is to oversee the church. Ignatius, however, taught that elders were lower than overseers and only responsible for one locality, while overseers were higher and responsible for churches in a region. This erroneous teaching brought in a hierarchy of elders and bishops and eventually archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</p>
<p>In society it is difficult to form people into a group without organization. But according to history, the formation of the nation of Israel did not depend on organization. Soon after man was scattered in Genesis 11, kings were produced. Hence, kings are a natural issue when humans form nations. Throughout the years of human history, human society has always had kings. However, when the people of Israel were established as a nation, God did not want them to have a king; He did not want them to have organization. He gave them only the priesthood, and they were governed by the priesthood. They also had the five books of Moses as their law and constitution. The nation of Israel was established by their dependence on the books of law in the Old Testament. The books of law do not speak of a national assembly, a king, or members of a cabinet. The nation of Israel had only a unique priesthood who taught the people. When there were problems among them, the high priest would bring the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim into the presence of God (Exo. 28:30). God&rsquo;s leading was revealed by means of light shining through the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
<p>Later the children of Israel followed the custom of the nations and insisted that Samuel appoint a king for them (1 Sam. 8:5, 19-20). Even though Jehovah their God was their King, they wanted another king. This offended God (v. 7; 12:17). It was Jehovah who sent Moses and Aaron to lead their fathers out of Egypt; He also saved them out of the hands of their enemies all around (vv. 8, 11). Therefore, God was the heavenly and living King of Israel. If God were not living, how could the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate shine? Nevertheless, the people of Israel wanted a king, and in 9:17 God gave them Saul. Saul was a negative king, who was used by God to discipline the people of Israel. After Saul, God established the proper kingship with David. David was not of the tribe of Levi; he was not a priest who was required to wear an ephod or the breastplate, yet he wore a linen ephod (30:7). This implies that David was not like the kings of the Gentile nations. Rather, he was like a priest who wore the breastplate to inquire of God.</p>
<p>This light concerning organization is lacking in Christianity. Many think that when the apostles laid their hands upon people at the time of Pentecost, they were setting up an organization. If this were the case, who organized the apostles on the day of Pentecost? Who appointed Stephen to teach the word or Philip to preach the gospel as an evangelist? Neither of them was appointed by man. They were appointed by the Holy Spirit. This is referred to in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14: the Spirit gives gifts to men. There was no organization at the time of Pentecost.</p>
<p>Some may ask whether the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were a form of organization. Was Paul&rsquo;s becoming an apostle not a matter of organization? This had nothing to do with organization. Paul and Barnabas were not appointed according to man&rsquo;s will; they were set apart by the Holy Spirit. According to Acts 13:1-3 the prophets and teachers in Antioch gathered and prayed, and the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; This was not organization. Paul and Barnabas were not apostles. It was after they were sent out that they were referred to as apostles (14:4-5, 14). This indicates that they became apostles when they were sent out; an apostle is one who is sent out. This is not a matter of organization.</p>
<p>Ignatius made a big mistake, and based on that mistake the Catholic Church believes that a priest governs only a small church; above priests are bishops, who are over regions; above bishops are archbishops; and above archbishops are cardinals, who are cabinet ministers of the church and form a central governing body called the curia. A person rises from being a priest to a bishop, then to an archbishop, and then to a cardinal. When he becomes a cardinal, he can participate in the election of the pope. When the pope dies, the cardinals hold an election among themselves to choose the next pope from among themselves. The pope is at the top, the cardinals and archbishops are beneath him, next are the bishops, and under them are priests. This is religious hierarchy. But the Lord Jesus&rsquo; asking the disciples to make the people sit down in groups and the apostles&rsquo; arranging for seven men to distribute food to the saints were not related to hierarchy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
