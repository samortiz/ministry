CHRISTIANS BEING A SPEAKING PEOPLE</H2><P>In the previous four lessons we have seen the essential work of the Spirit within the believers. But we know that there is the economical aspect of the Spirit as well. God's economical Spirit of power is mainly for speaking. He is the speaking Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 9:16 Paul said, "Necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel."</P><P>[We all have to realize that it is God's desire that we Christians should be a speaking people, and we have to try our best to fulfill His desire.] </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Witnesses of the Living Christ</H2><P>[In Acts 1:8, the Lord Jesus told the disciples, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth."] [Not just in our meetings, but even in our daily life, we must be people all the time speaking Christ, all the time speaking for Christ, and all the time speaking forth Christ. Whenever and wherever we open up our mouths, we speak Christ, we speak for Christ, and we speak forth Christ....A witness is a speaking one, one who only speaks things concerning the one he is testifying. We are His witnesses and we have to speak Him, speak for Him, and speak forth Him on every occasion. Even when young ones go to their grandparents, they should not speak that much concerning other things. They should speak Christ, speak for Christ, and speak forth Christ.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. With the Spirit Upon Us and Within Us</H2><P>[According to the principle revealed in the Scriptures, to speak God, to speak forth Christ, and to speak for Christ, surely we need the Spirit. Without the Spirit, we would not speak, and even if we would speak, we would feel shameful. When you talk about science, geography, history, or the political situation, the more you talk, the more you feel quite proud. There is no restriction or frustration in speaking about these things. But whenever you speak about Jesus, the feeling of shame follows right away. It seems hard to open up your mouth to speak about Jesus to people. Unless we have the Spirit, it is really hard for us to speak Christ. But when we are filled with the Spirit, we become crazy; we like to speak things concerning Christ to people.]</P><P>[To speak we need the Spirit. This Spirit is upon us and this Spirit is within us. Hallelujah! We were baptized in the Spirit; therefore, the Spirit is upon us. We are also drinking the Spirit; therefore, the Spirit is in us. We have the Spirit. Now we just need to exercise, to amen what the Bible says. The Bible says the Spirit is upon us. We say, "Amen." The Bible says the Spirit is within us. We say, "Amen." We do exercise such a spirit to realize that we are really in the spirit, and the Spirit is upon us and is also within us. When I speak, He is speaking in my speaking. We have to practice this all the day long. If there is no one to speak to, just speak to the angels in the air or the demons around you.]</P>
