   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: The Ten Commandments in Exodus 34 are different from the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 34:28 says clearly that Jehovah wrote these commandments with His finger.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Liu, Shantung</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: There is no clear record of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 34.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Ten Commandments are only recorded in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus 34:10-26 are not the Ten Commandments, but God's speaking outside of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we read carefully verses 27 and 28, we will know that there is a difference between "these words" in verse 27 and "the words of the covenant" in verse 28.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"These words" in verse 27 refer to the words in verses 10-26; they are what God ordered Moses to write down.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The words of the covenant" in verse 28 refer to the Ten Commandments and were written by God Himself Deut 10:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God made the covenant with the people of Israel Exo 34:27 according to the words of verses 10-26.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The words of the covenant are the Ten Commandments v. 28 . From this we know that the words in verses 10-26 are not part of the words of the Ten Commandments; they are merely words according to which God made the covenant Ten Commandments with the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that Moses went up to the mountain twice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first time, God wrote the Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to him Deut 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, because the people of Israel sinned, Moses broke the tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he went up to the mountain the second time, the Bible says: Jehovah "wrote upon the tablets as He had done the first writing, the ten words" Deut 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Ten Commandments that Moses received twice on the mountain are completely the same without any difference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Deuteronomy 5 is a recount of Exodus 20, whereas Deuteronomy 10 is a recount of Exodus 34.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Deuteronomy 10:4 clearly proves that the Ten Commandments received in Exodus 34:28 are the same as those in Exodus 20.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, our conclusion is that the Ten Commandments received in Exodus 34 are the same as those received in Exodus 20, but they were not itemized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As to the words in 34:10-26, they are merely God's words besides the Ten Commandments that Moses recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD OR SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: Second Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 record the same incident.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Samuel says God moved David to number Israel, but 1 Chronicles says that Satan did it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The number of men that drew the sword is different in these two records also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How are these explained?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Liu, Shantung</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Answer: Dr. Gaebelein said that 2 Samuel 24:1 can be translated as "the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel and permitted David to be moved." Hence, 1 Chronicles states directly that Satan moved David, whereas 2 Samuel tells of God's stand concerning David's being moved, that He permitted David to be moved by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the two portions are not contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the story should be as follows: The anger of God was kindled against Israel; Satan took the opportunity to move David to sin, while God allowed this to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As to why God was angry toward Israel, we find no clear record about this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the second matter, the number of men who drew the sword, the records are as follows in the two books: Second Samuel says, "There were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men" 24:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Chronicles says, "All they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword" 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles speak of are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second Samuel tells the number of valiant men who drew the sword, whereas 1 Chronicles records the number of men who drew the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dr. Scofield said, "Some discrepant statements concerning numbers are, however, found in the existing manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are most naturally ascribed to the fact that the Hebrews used letters in the place of numerals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The letters from Koph to Tau express hundreds up to four hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Five certain Hebrew letters, written in a different form, carry hundreds up to nine hundred, while thousands are expressed by two dots over the proper unit letter: e.g., the letter Teth, used alone, stands for nine; with two dots it stands for nine thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Error in transcription of Hebrew numbers thus becomes easy, preservation of numerical accuracy difficult."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>See footnote on 1 Corinthians 10:8 in the Scofield Reference Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should know that God is not responsible for mistakes in copying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For instance, on page 2057 of the Chinese Union Bible, the word gathered was misprinted as marry translator's note: the Chinese characters for these two words are very similar .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Numbers 3:35 the name of Merari was also misprinted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are proofreading mistakes for which God is not responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can we say that the Bible is in error because of these mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May God bless you and lead you away from putting your trust in the unbelieving tune of the absurd higher critics.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>ADAM AND EVE, AND SOLOMON</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Question: Are these three people saved or lost?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Liu, Feng Village</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Answer: We do not have to worry about whether dead persons are saved or lost, because God is just, and with Him there is no respect of persons Rom 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, these three are probably all saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God made coats of skins Gen 3:21 , which represent the salvation of the Lord Jesus, for Adam and Eve, so they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Solomon is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, he cannot possibly be lost.</S>
