<p>All of us need to be those who are begetting, nourishing, and teaching others. To go and knock on doors is for begetting, bringing forth, children. The full-timers should bring forth or beget one child every week. After one is baptized, that one is delivered. Baptism is a kind of delivery. Then the child needs nourishing and feeding. Without nourishing and feeding, no child can grow. After nourishing there is the need of teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING PEOPLE TO GROW IN THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
BY NOURISHING THEM<br />
WITH THE MILK OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>To carry out the growth in the divine life is a crucial and central point in the divine revelation. The main point in leading people to grow is to nourish them. In 1 Peter 2:2-3 and Hebrews 5:12-14 there is the secret of the nourishing of our spiritual children. No other verses are better than these two portions. First Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we need to long to drink the milk of the word. This indicates clearly that the word in the holy Scriptures is considered by Peter as milk. All the mothers know that the best nourishment for their children is to feed them milk. If we have tasted the Lord (1 Pet. 2:3), then we will long for the nourishing milk in His word. Once a little babe tastes milk, he will long to drink more all the time. When little babies cry, their crying is a kind of prayer. The mothers answer their prayer by giving them some milk to drink. Every day, even in the night, the children &ldquo;pray&rdquo; this way because they have tasted the good taste of milk.</p>
<p>You have to believe that once you baptize a person, that person should have tasted the good taste of God&rsquo;s word. When you visit people, do not speak your own word; present them with God&rsquo;s word. Their enjoyment of the good taste of God&rsquo;s word will create an appetite within them. The little babes do not know what milk contains, but they have tasted the taste of milk which creates an appetite within them to long for milk. Perhaps on your second visit to a person&rsquo;s home, he will get baptized. Then when you go to them the next time, you will set up a home meeting. In these following times, you have to learn how to nourish them, how to feed them. In the matter of nourishing and feeding, there is much to learn. In this matter I do not consider that I have graduated. I am still learning how to nourish people, how to feed people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE NEW LIFE LESSONS WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>According to what I have learned, the first thing in leading people to grow in the home meetings is to nourish them with the milk of the word by using the <em>New Life Lessons.</em> The titles of the ten lessons are as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>Lesson One&mdash;Assurance of Salvation</li>
<li>Lesson Two&mdash;Prayer</li>
<li>Lesson Three&mdash;Reading the Bible</li>
<li>Lesson Four&mdash;Meeting</li>
<li>Lesson Five&mdash;Preaching the Gospel</li>
<li>Lesson Six&mdash;Fellowshipping with the Lord</li>
<li>Lesson Seven&mdash;Consecration</li>
<li>Lesson Eight&mdash;Living in the Spirit</li>
<li>Lesson Nine&mdash;Experiencing Christ</li>
<li>Lesson Ten&mdash;Knowing the Church</li>
</ul>
<p>At most you can cover one lesson at a time in each meeting. Every lesson is very short, but you have to learn how to use these lessons. First, you should train the new contacts how to pray. Before reading, it would be good to say, &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo; Then you may need to explain a little bit what prayer is. To pray at this juncture is to ask the Lord to breathe upon His word, to anoint His word by His Spirit. We ask the Lord to do this through His blood which washes us all the time. You have to explain this to a new one. This is the way to train them. Do not explain too much though. They will learn. Then take the lead to pray. Sometimes, depending upon the environment and atmosphere, after you pray one or two sentences, you could charge the new contacts (maybe one or two of them) to pray once and again. After a few times of your visitation, these new ones will learn to pray. Their learning how to pray is a kind of nourishment. You are nourishing them.</p>
<p>After this prayer, with a little amount of training to pray, open to the first page and ask the new contact to read with you. Not only should he read, but you also need to read with him. You have to learn to cooperate with the new contacts in the reading and stress the main points. Then at every stress of an important or crucial point, you should pray together&mdash;only two or three sentences of prayer. Always keep praying along with the reading of the lesson. Thus, you will impress them with the crucial points and also train them to pray, even to mingle their prayer with the word. Actually, this is pray-reading. Every lesson is so short; therefore, this would not take a long time.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Way to Carry Out the Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
