   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Small Groups Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Nature of Home Nurturing,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whereas Joint Meetings Being</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the Nature of School Education</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, the most essential component is the need for strong family units.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A family unit will produce and nurture strong, healthy descendants who will be strong citizens of a country.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without sufficiently strong families, there will be weak citizens of a weak country.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This principle is the same for the church; if a family is not strong, it will be difficult for the saints to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, another essential component is the need for a matching system of education.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Homes are for nurturing, and schools are for educating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both of these components are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, after studying our situation, we realize that there is still a need for joint meetings in the church life, which are in the nature of school education, and for small group meetings, which are in the nature of home nurturing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the citizens of a nation have proper nurturing in the homes plus a good education at school, its young people will grow spontaneously to become strong citizens who will make the nation powerful and prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church also has a need for proper nurturing in the family units of the small groups and, at the same time, for gathering together in joint meetings from once a week to at least once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During these times, there should be some education in the truth, which is in the nature of a school.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From now on we should stress both sides because everything needs two sides in order to go forward with balance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a person with only one leg has difficulty walking, and a person with one eye has difficulty seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for a church to go on in a good way, there must be home nurturing and school education.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we must have small group meetings for home nurturing, and we must also have joint meetings to educate in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the past we relied only on joint meetings and neglected the nurturing in the homes; consequently, many people did not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, without the family units in the homes, our newborn children were not nurtured and could not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must recover the small groups and build them up as the base of our increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Small Groups Being the Genuine Base</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>for the Church s Increase and Spread</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forming small groups has another advantage of not needing additional large facilities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord blesses us in our pursuit of our vow to bring one person to the Lord in the coming year, we will double in number.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, if we continue to recover the saints who have not been meeting for some time, the number in the Lord s Day meeting in the church in Taipei will surpass ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are dependent upon big meetings, where could these people meet?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We would not be able to keep up with the need even if we immediately began to build new meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if our homes are the base, whether or not we have a meeting hall will not be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even without a meeting hall, people can meet in homes and receive care.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if there are no homes, many people will have no place to go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we cannot rely solely on the big meetings; instead, we must rely on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there are five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, there needs to be at least five hundred small groups; if the number of people meeting increases to ten thousand, then we need to form one thousand small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In principle, the number of homes and the formation of small groups should increase proportionately to the increase in the number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, with or without meeting halls, we can still have the church life and take care of people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we have homes as our base and set them up well, all our basic problems can be addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if we have no schools for higher education, we can provide a general education, even if it is at a high school level.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, our first responsibility is to recover the small groups and to make them more effective than before.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that all of us would be impressed deeply and receive this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not for others but for us so that all our homes can be opened from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the means and the base for the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once this way is established, even denominational groups in Christianity will adopt this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today Christianity is not flourishing because they rely on big meetings and on one preacher or pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although this is better than nothing, it is not the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The proper way involves small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once small groups are established, there will be the increase.</S>
