<h1 class="msg">Lesson Three</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SON BEING THE EMBODIMENT<br>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Jn. 1:1; 20:28; Phil. 2:6; Isa. 9:6; Jn. 14:9-10; Matt. 1:18, 20;<br>Jn. 6:46; 2 Cor. 3:17; Col. 1:19; 2:9.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Son being God</li><li>The Son being the Father</li><li>The Son's incarnation being of the Holy Spirit</li><li>The Son coming "from-with" the Father</li><li>The Son being the Spirit</li><li>All the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Him</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><P>So far we have seen that God is one. But this God is triune&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit. All Three are God, eternal, coexisting, and coinhering eternally. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Spirit is God. The Father, Son, and Spirit do not exist at different times as three different modes of one God. They are not three separate Gods, but one Triune God. What a mysterious God! But even though He is mysterious, we can experience and enjoy Him. Hallelujah! In this lesson we shall see something more of this great mystery: the Son is even the Triune God. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SON BEING GOD</H2><P>John 1:1 says, "The Word was God." John 20:28 says, "Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!" Philippians 2:6 says, "Who subsisting in the form of God." All these verses tell us that the Son, Jesus Christ, is God Himself. Some people think that He is merely the Son of God (as though He were not God Himself), but the Bible clearly reveals to us that even though He is the Son of God, He is God Himself. He is not a separate person from God. He is God. He was God in the beginning (eternity past); He was God when He lived as a man two thousand years ago; He is God today and will be God forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SON BEING THE FATHER</H2><P>Another part of this mystery is that the Son is the Father. Let us look at Isaiah 9:6: "Unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...everlasting Father." The Lord Jesus said in John 14:9-10, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father...I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me." Here again the Bible makes it clear to us that Jesus the Son is also the Father. The Father and the Son are one. The Son is even the Father. We do not know how the Son can also be the Father, but this is what the Bible says&#151;we just believe it.</P>
