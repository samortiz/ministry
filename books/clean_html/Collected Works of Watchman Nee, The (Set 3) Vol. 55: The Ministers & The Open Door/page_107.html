Lessons 1 through 16 cover the experience of a person from his beginning as a sinner through his knowledge of salvation. Lessons 17 through 26 cover matters that a believer should practice after he is saved. Lessons 27 through 52 cover things that a believer should know and pursue after he is saved.</p><p>For believers who are not clear about their salvation, the goal of studying these lessons is to know the Lord's salvation. For believers who are clear about their salvation, the goal is to provide them a foundation in all the basic matters of the Bible.</p><p>There is much light in these topics. (Some of it was not discovered by the editor, but was communicated through men whom God has used in the past, and subsequently became light to the editor.) All of these topics are very precious, and are desperately needed by many of God's children.</p><p>Witness Lee, Editor</p><h2 class="head3">Table of Contents</h2><p>1) The Condition of Man, 2) God's Love, 3) The Redemption of Christ, 4) The Work of the Holy Spirit, 5) Repentance and Believing, 6) Forgiveness, 7) Cleansing, 8) Sanctification, 9) Justification, 10) Reconciliation with God, 11) Regeneration, 12) Eternal Life, 13) Release, 14) Salvation, 15) The Proof of Salvation, 16) The Assurance of Salvation, 17) Obeying the Sense of Life, 18) Living in the Fellowship of Life, 19) Consecration, 20) Dealing with Sin, 21) Guidance, 22) Obeying God's Will, 23) Being Filled with the Holy Spirit, 24) Preaching the Gospel, 25) Serving the Lord, 26) A Few Matters concerning the Believers' Living, 27) The Knowledge of God, 28) God's Faithfulness and His Righteousness, 29) God's Choosing and Predestination, 30) The Union of God and Man, 31) The Person of Christ, 32) The Precious Blood of Christ, 33) Law and Grace, 34) In Adam and in Christ, 35) The Believers' Two Natures, 36) Three Lives and Four Laws, 37) Union with Christ, 38) Service in the New Testament, 39) The Believers and Sin, 40) Reward, 41) Entering the Kingdom of the Heavens, 42) Sufferings, 43) The Church, 44) Angels, 45) The Devil, 46) The World, 47) Sin, 48) Death and Resurrection, 49) Judgment, 50) Heaven and Hell, 51) The Believers and the Rapture, 52) Christ's Second Coming.
