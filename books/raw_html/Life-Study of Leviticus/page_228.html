<h2 class=head4>b. Of a Female from Twenty to Sixty Years Old, Thirty Shekels</h2><p>“And if it is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels” (v. 4). Here we see that the valuation of a female from twenty to sixty years old is thirty shekels, second to that of the males above. The female signifies those who are weaker than and inferior to the male. This is God’s ordination and it is according to His creation.<h2 class=head4>c. Of a Male from Five to Twenty Years Old, Twenty Shekels</h2><p>“If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels” (v. 5a). Those in this category, the third most valuable, signify those who are spiritually young in the church (cf. 1 John 2:13-14).<h2 class=head4>d. Of a Female from Five to Twenty Years Old, Ten Shekels</h2><p>The valuation of a female from five to twenty years old is ten shekels (v. 5b), second to the male.<h2 class=head4>e. Of a Male from One Month to Five Years Old, Five Shekels</h2><p>“And if the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver” (v. 6a). Those in this category are the least valuable of the males and signify those who are spiritually the young children (cf. 1 John 2:13).<h2 class=head4>f. Of a Female from One Month to Five Years Old, Three Shekels</h2><p>The valuation of a female from one month to five years old is three shekels (v. 6b), the least valuable.<h2 class=head4>g. Of a Male from Sixty Years Old and Upward, Fifteen Shekels</h2><p>“If the person is from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, the valuation shall be fifteen shekels” (v. 7a). The age from sixty years old and upward indicates a male’s deterioration. This signifies those who are spiritually deteriorated.
