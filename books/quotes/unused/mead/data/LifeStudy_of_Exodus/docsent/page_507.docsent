   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:22-33 THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was young, I heard many messages from the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I often heard about the Passover lamb and the manna, and I heard a few messages about the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, I did not hear anything concerning the compound spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel stayed at Mount Sinai to receive the law and the ordinances and then to receive the revelation of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some teachers pointed out that the law was given as God s test of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did not intend that the children of Israel would keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But because of their ignorance, it was necessary for Him to give it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God tested the children of Israel by giving them the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately after the decree of the law, God gave Moses the revelation of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These teachers pointed out that this revelation is a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:17 says, For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus Christ is the reality of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When this tabernacle came, grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some teachers had light concerning this; however, their experience was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because they were short of experience, they could not properly understand the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Experience is not necessary simply to teach the tabernacle doctrinally as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as we have objective light, we can teach this type in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But to touch the real significance of the compound ointment in our teaching requires spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the teachers were lacking in experience, they did not know the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bible teachers have pointed out that the oil in Exodus 30, as elsewhere in the Old Testament, typifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have even taught that the oil poured by Jacob on the stone in Genesis 28 signifies the Spirit poured upon God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But although these teachers of the Bible have seen the significance of the oil, they have not seen the significance of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ointment in Exodus 30 is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, in itself, oil is not a compound, but rather a single element without any other ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ointment was a compound formed by blending four spices with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This compound ointment can be compared to paint.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paint is a compound containing more than one element.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same is true of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. A. Coates has much to say concerning the Spirit in his writing on Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He devotes nearly three pages to the ointment and the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this section of his writing he uses the terms the Spirit of Christ or the Spirit twenty-one times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not speak of the Spirit as the Holy Spirit or as the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once he speaks of the Spirit of the Man of God s pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He indicates that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the Man of God s pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Coates also speaks of the Spirit of another Man, even the Man sitting on the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. A. Coates says that the four spices represent all those features of grace which were so perfectly blended and harmonized in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that Coates realized something concerning the blending of the spices with the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, he does not say what are the features of grace that are blended in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regarding this, he did not have light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not see that myrrh signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ and that cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, he did not see that calamus, rising up out of a muddy situation and shooting into the air, is a symbol of Christ s resurrection, and that cassia, a substance that repels insects and snakes, typifies the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sequence of the four spices is significant: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, here we can see three complete units of five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There were five hundred shekels of myrrh and five hundred shekels of cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we have two complete units.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But there were two hundred fifty shekels each of cinnamon and calamus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Together these half units make another complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is significant that it is the second unit that is split into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is at least an indication that the Second of the Trinity was split into two parts on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, with the ingredients of the holy anointing oil and the measurements, we have symbols of the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, in the spices we also see the effectiveness of Christ s death and the power of His resurrection.</S>
