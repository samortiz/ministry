   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Eating the Word Spoken</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by Christ as Spirit and as Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is to eat the word spoken by Christ as spirit and as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ speaks the word, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the word, the Spirit, and life are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Speaker of the word is the processed Triune God, and His speaking transmits the processed Triune God into us in the form of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After entering into us, this word becomes the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, when we utter this Spirit out to others, the Spirit becomes the word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When others receive the word into them, it becomes the Spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, when they speak the Spirit out to others, He again becomes the word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, when we receive the word into us, the word becomes the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the transmission of the Triune God into us as our life supply, first in the form of the word, then in the form of the Spirit, and ultimately in the form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way the Triune God becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By Drinking the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>through Believing into Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>to Flow Rivers of Living Water</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>out of Our Innermost Being</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by drinking the Spirit through believing into Christ to flow rivers of living water out of our innermost being John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rom 15:30; 1 Thes 1:6; 2 Thes 2:13; Gal 5:22-23 , originating from the one unique river of water of life Rev 22:1 , which is God's Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The one river in Genesis 2:10-14 became four heads.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way, not just one river but many rivers flow out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By Following Christ to Have the Light of Life</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and by No Means Walk in Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ in the Gospel of John is by following Him to have the light of life and by no means walk in darkness 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By following Christ, we shall by no means walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am grateful to the Lord that I have the feeling that I am walking in the light and that I am not in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A living person has light, but a dead person is altogether in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An electric light may shine intensely, but a dead person will receive no light because he has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, a living person under the same light will immediately receive light because he has life.</S>
