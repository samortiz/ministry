   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isa 9:6 ...A Son is given to us...and His name will be called...Eternal Father...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 14:9 Jesus said to Philip ...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 Cor 3:17 And the Lord is the Spirit...</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rom 8:15 For you have...received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, two of the main divine titles used are God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God in Greek is Theos.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God, Theos, equals God, Elohim, in the Old Testament, denoting the unique yet triune God 1 Cor 8:4, 6; 1 Tim 2:5a the Father being God 1 Pet 1:2-3 , the Son being God Heb 1:8 , and the Holy Spirit being God Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Theologians have accurately pointed out that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three separate gods, but three hypostases, or supporting substances, of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, theologians began to use the word persons for the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Person comes from the Latin word persona, which was an actor s mask.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One person can have three masks or appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some have said wrongly that the three of the Godhead, the Father, Son, and Spirit, are separate from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I published something pointing out that the three of the Godhead are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are always one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we have the Father, we have the Son and the Spirit because the three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Son is here, the Spirit and the Father are with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are distinct, but one....They are one God with three aspects the aspect as the Father, the aspect as the Son, and the aspect as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>19</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is three yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In essence God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In economy, in God s move, God is three.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the best theology refers to the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Essentially God is one, but economically God is three.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God the Father sent the Son in His economy, in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son did things by the Spirit in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father, Son, and Spirit are three economically in Their move and administration, but not in Their essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Essentially God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the Bible shows that the Son is the Father Isa 9:6; John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, Paul said that the last Adam, who was the Son in the flesh, after His death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said in 2 Corinthians 3:17 that the Lord, the Son, is the Spirit....This means that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Father</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another divine title used in the New Testament is Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Father, in Greek Pater, denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God s creatures Eph 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God s creation there are many families, such as the family of the angels, the family of mankind, and the family of the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The source, the Father, of these families is God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, there is a particular family, the highest family, which is the household of the faith Gal 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is the Father, especially of the household of the faith, which is begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We believers are a particular family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, we are the genuine family because we were not only created by God as the Creator, the origin, the source, but also regenerated, begotten by God....We have a Father in life who regenerated us, who imparted His very life essence into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father is also called Abba Aramaic Father Greek .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus addressed God as Abba Father Mark 14:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostle Paul also told us we cry Abba, Father in the spirit of sonship Rom 8:15; Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Abba Father is an intensified expression of intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we say Father, this is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we say Abba, this is sweeter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when we say Abba, Father, this is the sweetest.</S>
