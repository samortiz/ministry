   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life is for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is the need of life because God's intention is to express Himself, and life is the means to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In creation all the lower lives are for the higher lives, all the higher lives are for the highest created life, and this highest life is for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man as the highest created life is living to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that man is after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man is not in his likeness, but in God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man is not in his image, but in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>James tells us that man uses his tongue not only to bless the Lord but also to "curse men, who have been made according to the likeness of God" 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to realize that all men have been made according to the likeness of God, so we should not despise any man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 11:7 says, "For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God's image and glory."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man was made in God's image Gen 1:26 to express God and glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say that God is our glory, but this verse says that we are God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may realize that God is our glory and may want to experience God as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we also have to realize that we are God's glory because we are going to express God by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without life, man can never express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, life is the means for us to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The plant life and the animal life are for the human life, for us to live for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The human life, the highest created life, is for the divine life, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man was created not only to express God but also to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been committed, entrusted, with God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God has authorized us to be His representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we have dominion over all things on earth except God Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is above us; we are under God, but we are above everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are above the things in the water, the things on the earth, and the things in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man is the real commander-in-chief of the land, of the sea, and of the air, and he was made to represent God by life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's eternal purpose is to have Himself expressed through the created human life, but Satan came in to frustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did everything he could to damage God's purpose, to frustrate God from accomplishing His eternal intention.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a struggle, a war, in the universe between Satan and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's direction is toward the expression of Himself, and Satan's direction is against this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in this universe there are two directions: the divine direction and the satanic direction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two directions contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is going to fulfill His purpose, and Satan is doing everything he can to frustrate God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the unique war and struggle in the entire universe, and this war is also going on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within us there is a struggle between Satan and God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants to express Himself through us, and Satan is doing everything to frustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before man was created, Satan rebelled against God and ruined and even usurped the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, the right of God on this earth has been robbed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The earth was and still is, in a sense, under the usurping hand of the enemy 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no problem for God in the heavens, but there is a real problem for God on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why the Lord Jesus prayed, "Let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth" Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no problem for God's will in heaven, but there is a real problem for God's will on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why we need to pray that the Father's will would be done on earth as it is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The real problem is that Satan today is usurping the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The earth is under his usurping hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why God said in Genesis 1 that the life that resembles Him has to conquer the earth, to subdue the earth v. 28 . The earth has to be subdued and conquered because of the rebellion against God on this earth instigated by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The rebellious earth needs to be conquered by man living with God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To conquer, to subdue, the earth we need the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Genesis 1:26 tells us that man was to have dominion "over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among the creeping things is the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The serpent signifies Satan, the Devil, who is the leader of the creeping things cf.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Luke 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To have dominion over the creeping things means to rule over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To conquer means to conquer the rebellion of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since God is almighty, all-powerful, it would be easy for Him to get rid of Satan on His own.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But God would not get rid of Satan directly by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wanted another creature, man, to be used by Him to get rid of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the human life is the means for God to get rid of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In His creation of man, God desires to accomplish two things: He wants to express Himself, and He wants to get rid of His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God uses man to express Himself and to get rid of Satan.</S>
