If we are the appreciators of the law, as David was in Psalm 1, we are on the line of good and evil. People may wonder what is wrong with good and evil. But if we trace this line to the end of the Bible, we arrive at the lake of fire. When you "drive" to and arrive at the end of the divine revelation on this line, you know you are wrong. The line of good and evil leads to the lake of fire.</P><P>The person in Psalm 2 takes refuge in the Son and kisses the Son, loves the Son (v. 12). This one surely is on the line of life leading to the New Jerusalem. We need to be those who are on the line of life. The person in Psalm 15 is on the line of good and evil. Psalm 16, however, reveals Christ as the God-man. He has been, still is, and always will be on the line of life. Those of us on the line of life will eventually be in the New Jerusalem, the city of living water.</P><P>After the fall of man, the Bible tells us that Adam had two sons. Actually, I believe Adam had more sons, but only two sons are recorded in the Bible because these two sons represent two lines. The first son was Cain, and the second son was Abel. Cain was a representative of good and evil. At first, he was good. He presented the offerings of the labor of his own hands to God. This was good according to Cain's way, but he was rejected. God rejects man's evil. God also rejects man's good as evil. Then when Cain was rejected by God, he immediately turned to kill his brother. This was evil (Gen. 4:1-8). On the one hand, he did something good. On the other hand, he did something evil. Both good and evil are in the same line. Cain was in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Abel, however, was not in this line. He enjoyed Christ as his burnt offering to contact God and to take God as his portion. Abel was in the line of life.</P><P>The title of this message is a question. This is the question David asks in Psalm 15&#151;"What kind of man may dwell with God for His heart's desire and good pleasure?" We may think that the man of good can dwell with God, but not the man of evil. Good and evil are our two lines. Teachers of philosophy and those of many religions would all say that if there is a God, only a good man, not an evil man, could dwell with Him. All of them would hold the same concept. But thank the Lord, in the Bible, which is His divine revelation, we have a pair of psalms, Psalms 15 and 16, to show us what kind of man God wants. God does not want an evil man or a good man. God rejects the good man as the evil man. They are of the same source, in the same nature, and in the same entity. They are in the same line and will arrive at the same end. Only a God-man can satisfy God's desire and fulfill His good pleasure.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
