The Life in the Word Being the Light of Man</H2><P>The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John as the "trunk" is that, first, in the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life (v. 4a). Then, the life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is (vv. 4b-11). We have the definite, assured, affirmed revelation of what God is. We see God. The life as light is shining forth to reveal, to speak, to tell us, what God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Receiving the Shining Light</H2><P>Whoever receives the shining light, which is Christ Himself, can have the divine life, carried forth by the light, that they may be born of God to be His children as the constituents of the house of God, Bethel (vv. 12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Consummating the New Jerusalem</H2><P>This trunk produces a branch. In this branch is life, and this life is the light shining over people. Whoever receives this light will have the authority to be the children of God. This ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem organically for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy revealed to us by the same writer, John (Rev. 21:2). The book of Revelation, written by John, is the consummation of his Gospel. What is revealed in his Gospel is the initiation of the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE WORD, GOD, AND THE SPIRIT<br>COOPERATING AND COORDINATING TOGETHER<br>IN THE SPEAKING FOR GOD</H2><P>The Word, God, and the Spirit cooperate and coordinate together in the speaking for God. Three-in-one speak together by cooperating and coordinating.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
