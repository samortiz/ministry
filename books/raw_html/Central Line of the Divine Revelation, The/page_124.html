<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN THE TYPES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Enjoyment of the Items of the Passover</H2><P>The divine economy and the divine dispensing are shown in the types of God's anticipated redemption and salvation in the enjoyment of the items of the Passover (Exo. 12:1-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Flesh of the Lamb<br>to Be Eaten by God's Redeemed,<br>Signifying the Redeeming Christ to Be Dispensed<br>into His Believers as the Life Supply</H2><P>First, the flesh of the lamb was to be eaten by God's redeemed people (v. 8a). This signifies that the redeeming Christ is to be dispensed into His believers as the life supply (1 Cor. 5:7b). The Lamb, which is the redeeming Christ, is dispensed into His believers in order to give them the strength and energy to go the way ordained by God.</P><P>The flesh of the lamb was eaten by God's redeemed people to satisfy them (Exo. 12:4; Matt. 15:32) and to strengthen them to run God's way (Exo. 12:11; 14:22; 15:13, 22; Heb. 12:1b; 2 Tim. 4:7b). First, the meat of the lamb was for their satisfaction. Then, once they were satisfied, the meat of the lamb strengthened them and gave them the energy to run God's way. The children of Israel would not have been able to take the way that God had ordained for them if they had not eaten the flesh of the lamb on the night of the Passover. The dispensing of the flesh of the lamb as their life supply gave them the strength and energy to walk the long way ordained by God in order to reach God's goal. By this strength they journeyed from Egypt to Mount Sinai, and there they were trained and built up by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Unleavened Bread<br>to Be Eaten by God's Redeemed,<br>Signifying the Sinless Christ to Be Dispensed<br>into His Believers as the Unleavened Element</H2><P>The unleavened bread was to be eaten by God's redeemed (Exo. 12:8b), signifying that the sinless Christ is to be dispensed into His believers as the unleavened element (1 Cor. 5:8). The lamb signifies the redeeming Christ; the unleavened bread signifies the sinless Christ. Bread was used as a meal offering (Lev. 2). The meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity. All men have the element of sin in their flesh, but Christ as a man had no sin in His flesh (2 Cor. 5:21). Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ came in "the likeness of the flesh of sin." He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He had no reality of the sin of the flesh. He had no substance of sin within Him. Christ had no sin and committed no sins (1 Pet. 2:22a); He had nothing to do with sin. Apparently, He was in sinful flesh. Actually, there was no reality of any sin in the flesh of Christ, because He was not born of Adam. He was born of a virgin through the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20, 23). As a result, He took on flesh, but His flesh had no sinful element. Christ is sinless. This sinless Christ is to be dispensed into His believers as the unleavened (sinless) element.</P>
