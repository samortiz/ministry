   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ASSUMING AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who truly possess authority never have to defend their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nine out of ten persons are prone to touch men, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God may or may not have appointed one to be an authority, but it is always unsightly for a man to recommend himself as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians the apostles were ranked first, but in 2 Corinthians the apostles were ranked last.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first book the apostles were the first to be mentioned; this relates to truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the second book Paul said they were the last because there he was speaking on his own behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both books are right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Corinthians despised the apostle, and placed him, who should have been first, in the last place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul said that he was indeed the last.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he was attacked, he defended himself by saying that he was less than the least; yet he was not without grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are always two sides to every spiritual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is equally wrong for an authority to expect submission from others and for a rebellious man to refuse to submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If Brother Witness comes here, the brothers have to take care that he eats well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Brother Witness has to exercise care that he does not eat too well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the brothers are concerned that Brother Witness is eating too well, they are probably not real brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if Brother Witness is afraid that he is not eating well enough, that is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are here to uphold God's authority, not our own.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must touch the matter of authority before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man only touches authority in man, the care he exercises will be nothing more than a sign of a weak conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY IN A THOROUGH WAY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have said enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have we touched God's authority?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every one of us has to settle this question within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not important whether the policeman is called Chang or Hwang.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a citizen of the state we have seen that we must obey the police.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are not subdued in this matter, we are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In covering the matter of authority, we cannot appoint one or two disobedient persons to go out and preach obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is useless if we only touch men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have a craving for others to submit to us, we are still an outsider.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am not here to pass on some teachings about authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am not saying that we should take these teachings to others and subject them to our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are for the humbling of our very person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are concerned with whether or not we have touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An authority is very tolerant of others' offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ was the greatest authority God ever appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet He experienced the greatest offense in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was offended throughout His life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the end He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Authority belongs to the Lord, not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The One who appoints authority is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we can prostrate ourselves before God, all of our problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are still craving submission from others and are concerned only about upholding our own authority, we are far from seeing the reality of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot be careless or loose in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will not let this matter slip by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to climb up a high mountain to see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to uphold God's authority and testify to this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should never consider how we can be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, we should learn submission and turn away from rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to learn to drain out every drop of our rebellious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that we will spend more time praying alone or in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that we will deal with this matter thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May we clearly see the principle of authority and submission as it is displayed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is wonderful that we can learn authority and submission here!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I pray that we will rise above the clouds and see everything clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>AN ADDITIONAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have an additional word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First Corinthians 16:16 says, "You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Who are the "such ones"?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should look back at verse 15: "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that anyone who has gone before us in the Lord should be an object of our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Concerning the house of Stephanas, the emphasis here is that they were given to minister to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although they might not have been that old, the believers should have submitted to them on account of their seniority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First Timothy 5:17 says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should obey the elders who take the lead in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who are younger should be subject to the elders, and everyone should be subject one to another.</S>
