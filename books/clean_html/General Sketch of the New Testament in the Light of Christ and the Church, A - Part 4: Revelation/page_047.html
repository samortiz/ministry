<h2 class="head3">Receiving the Life Supply by Following the Flow</h2>
<p>In the flow there is the tree of life, the life supply. We can prove this by our experience. When we have the flow within us, we have the way, and when we follow the flow, we are satisfied and nourished. We have something to feed on, and we are satisfied, strengthened, liberated, refreshed, and revived day by day.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says that the tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. Our experience should not be like the children of Israel who ate the same food, the manna, every day for forty years. We should have new fruit, that is, new experiences of Christ. Some dear brothers and sisters enjoy the same fruit for twenty years. They testify of their experience of Christ one year, and many years later they testify of the same experience. Eventually they lose their taste to repeat their testimony. Their experiences are good but too old. We need new experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is unlimited and unsearchably rich. The river of living water is the flow of the Holy Spirit, and the tree of life is the living Christ. That the tree of life grows in the flow of the river signifies that the living Christ is in the flow of the Holy Spirit. Wherever the living flow of the Spirit is, there is the living Christ. We all need to experience the river of life and the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Leaves of the Tree<br />
Being for the Healing of the Nations</h2>
<p>The last part of verse 2 says that the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. The nations on the new earth will be those people who remain after the final judgment on the rebellious mankind at the end of the millennium. They will be transferred from the millennial kingdom to the new earth to be the nations. The believers are the regenerated ones who are born anew to be kings in God&rsquo;s royal family and components of the New Jerusalem. The restored nations, however, are not regenerated but simply restored according to God&rsquo;s dispensation for them.</p>
<p>The one thousand years of the coming kingdom will be a period of restoration. All creation, including the plants, the sun, and all things, will be restored to their original condition in creation. According to Isaiah 30:26 the light of the sun in the millennium will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days. Due to the fall of man, the entire creation became degraded, but at the time of the millennial kingdom, all things will be restored. Even the human race will be restored. During this time if someone lives to a hundred years of age, he will only be a lad (65:20). After this, the restored human race will be transferred from the millennial kingdom to the new earth to be the nations and the peoples under the rule of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>How can the peoples of the nations live forever, not having been regenerated? It is by the leaves of the tree of life. Whereas the regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life. Leaves here are a symbol. Leaves are the covering of a tree, like clothing, and in the Scriptures clothing typifies man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). That the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life signifies that they take the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation. Living by the example of the Lord Jesus will heal the nations and solve their problems. We the regenerated believers, however, will enjoy Christ as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSINGS OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED IN ETERNITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">No More Curse and Having the Throne of God and of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:3a says, &ldquo;And there will no longer be a curse. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it.&rdquo; In the new heaven and new earth there will be no curse because sin and death will be gone. However, there is an additional principle here: Where the throne of God is established, there the curse is gone. To have a curse means that we do not have the throne. If the throne of God is within us, we will have no curse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Serving God and the Lamb</h2>
<p>Verse 3b goes on to say, &ldquo;And His slaves will serve Him.&rdquo; We will not only rule and reign with the Lord, but we will serve Him as priests. To reign with the Lord is the aspect of kingship, while to serve the Lord is a matter of the priesthood.</p>
