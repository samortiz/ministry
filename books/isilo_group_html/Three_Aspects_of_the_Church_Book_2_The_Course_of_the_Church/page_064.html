<p>It would be ideal if in every city there was a church that we were at peace with in our conscience; then there would be no need for us to set up other meetings. However, the practices of some Christians bother our conscience; the way they do things makes it impossible for us to maintain a pure conscience.</p>
<p>The believers should love one another, but we do not love one another merely because we serve the Lord together. Brotherly love is based on whether we can preserve a pure conscience; this is not a debatable doctrinal point. If we can maintain a pure conscience, we can pass through anything. If we can maintain a pure conscience, we absolutely must not establish &ldquo;our&rdquo; meetings in any locality.</p>
<p>The preceding four items are negative&mdash;not participating, not interfering, not criticizing, and not mentioning. On the positive side, we should take every opportunity to preach the gospel to unbelievers and to minister life to believers. This is our attitude.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Caring for Others&rsquo; Criticism<br />
but Standing before God</h2>
<p>As long as we have a proper attitude, we do not need to fear criticism or opposition. We should not expect that there will not be any criticism or opposition; the only thing that we should care about is our standing before God. If we care about what others say and are influenced by them, then we will not properly follow the Lord&rsquo;s way. We must learn to be humble, to not fear the criticisms of others, and to live before the Lord.</p>
<p>It is wrong for some brothers to seek to draw others into our meetings; other brothers are afraid of criticism, and this also is wrong. The proper attitude is to live as though Christianity does not exist and know only of the Lord, sinners, and Christians.</p>
<p>We must learn the lessons of life before the Lord and learn to receive grace to seek opportunities to minister life to others. If someone misunderstands and criticizes us, we should simply let it go. It is not our responsibility. We should not be proud, but if we are afraid of criticism, we are weak. The fact that we do not participate in Christianity will cause some to criticize us; we cannot avoid criticism for not participating in Christianity. We must keep a pure conscience in order to stand on the ground of oneness and walk in the way of oneness. The issue at hand is not of leaving the denominations but of having a pure conscience. The most important thing is to live purely before God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
