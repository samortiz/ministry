<h2 class="head1">SIN WITHIN MAN BEING A LAW</h2><p>What do we know about the sin that lies within man? Paul says that this inward sin is a law in our members (Rom. 7:23). What is a law? A law is something that acts the same way all the time. For example, a nation may establish a law saying that whoever kills another man will lose his own life. It does not matter who you are; as long as you kill someone, you will lose your life. If you kill someone this year, you will lose your life; if you kill someone next year, you will still lose your life. A law, once passed, will never change. Consider the law of gravity. When you drop something, it falls immediately to the ground. Regardless of whether you are in Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai, England, or America, the minute you drop something, it will fall to the ground. This is a law. Every phenomenon that acts the same way all the time and never changes is a law. According to Paul the sin that is within us is a law.</p><p>Sin is a law because we follow a pattern or a track when we sin. Whenever someone rebukes us, we feel unhappy. If we are rebuked in the morning, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked in the evening, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked today, we feel unhappy; and if we are rebuked tomorrow or the day after, we also will feel unhappy. Every day of the year, we feel the same way. When others praise us, we feel happy, and the happiness that we feel is the same every day of the year. Our reaction is the same no matter what day of the year it is. Our sins behave the same way. All of our sins are very specific. In the world there are Ph.D.'s in many fields. But I have never met a Ph.D. in committing sins. A person can only commit one or two kinds of sin; he cannot commit every kind of sin. This may sound strange to you, but one must realize that it is not easy to invent new sins. The same one or two sins always come back to us; they always bother and control us. We have become specialized in one or two sins. A stubborn person is stubborn in whatever he does. He will not give in at all. A proud person is always proud; a hot-tempered person always has his temper. Sin is a law in us. It controls us all the time and causes us to commit the same kind of sins over and over again. It is very rare for a person to commit one kind of sin today, another kind tomorrow, and yet another kind the day after.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you are very familiar with at least one sin. If you are twenty years old, perhaps this sin has followed you for twenty years. If you are fifty years old, this sin may have followed you for fifty years. If you are not saved, this sin will follow you for the rest of your life. This is what Paul referred to as the "sin which is in my members." This sin cannot be taken away simply by forgiveness, because after a sinful act is forgiven, the law of sin is still present. We can be saved, but after we are saved, sins may still follow us.</p><p>Paul also had a sin which followed him. Even after he had made up his mind not to sin, he continued to sin. Even though he rejected this sin, he could not be free from it. Later, he exclaimed, "Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (Rom. 7:24). The words "body of this death" had a special connotation to the Romans. The Romans had a form of punishment in which a murderer was tied to a dead corpse, face against face, feet against feet, and legs against legs. When the murderer sat down, the corpse would also sit down with him. When he walked, the corpse would walk with him. The corpse would follow him wherever he went, and he would never be freed from the corpse. Paul said that his sin was like a dead corpse that tenaciously followed him, pursued him, and attached itself to his body. Brothers and sisters, have you seen that there is a kind of sin that is like a dead corpse which follows you all the time? It will not let you go. If you have not realized this, you will not be delivered. God wants to point out how evil the sin within you is. It is as repugnant and detestable as a dead corpse. There is no alternative other than getting it out of the way. Only then will you be rescued. Some people know that they need forgiveness through the blood when they sin. But they do not know that there is a sin within them, urging and forcing them to do many things against their will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS DEALING WITH THE SIN WITHIN MAN</h2><p>In the Bible there are two different ways of dealing with sin: The sins before God are taken away by the blood, but the sin in the flesh must be dealt with by the work of the cross. The effect of the blood and the effect of the cross are entirely different. The blood is for God. It is outward and objective. The cross is for man. It is inward and subjective. The Bible only speaks of man being crucified with Christ; it does not speak of man shedding blood with Christ. Only Christ can deal with outward sins. Man cannot do this. However, in order to deal with inward sin, the old man has to be annulled by the power of the cross (Rom. 6:6). The old man is the old "I."</p><p>Romans 6:6 speaks of three things: the old man, the body of sin, that is, the body that belongs to sin, and sin itself. First, there is sin, then there is the old man, and finally there is the body. What does it mean for a person to no longer be a slave to sin? Sin is the lord and master, the one who has the power over man. In the original Greek, as well as in English translations, the word "sin" is singular in this verse. This is the inward sin, the motivating power that urges and compels us to sin. Some have been serving this sin for decades, and they are still not free from it. Sometimes they resist a little, but they are always defeated. Even though sin is powerful, we cannot blame it for our acts of sins. The one to blame is our old man. The old man is the one that has descended from Adam's fall.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what happens when we sin? When we are about to sin, something in us tells us that it is wrong to sin. However, a power within compels us and causes us to sin. Suppose someone says something that is not very nice about us. Something within urges us to argue with him. The thing that is urging us to commit a sin is the inward sin. We are Christians, and we know that it is wrong to argue with others, but if we do not argue, we feel unhappy. After we argue, we feel better because we have vented our anger. It seems as if a company director is giving us all kinds of instructions, while a company executive is ratifying all his instructions. The result is the actual carrying out of the sinful actions.</p><p>Sin is a power that induces us to sin. It is our old man that determines to sin because it likes to sin. One brother told me that if he tried to be patient, he would get an ulcer. Can you see how powerful the inward temptation is? Sin gives the suggestion, and the old man gives the consent. One does the persuading, and the other performs the actions. The body is merely the acting faculty. No sin can be carried out without the body. The body is like a puppet. When you tell it to sin, it sins. When you tell it to act, it acts. The Bible calls it the body of sin. All evil things come from the body. The eyes behold evil things, the mind thinks evil things, the hands perform evil things, and the legs walk on evil paths. All the evil things are done by the body. According to the Bible, sin proposes, the old man consents, and the body acts. When these three work together, man sins.</p>
