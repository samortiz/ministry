   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AN INTRODUCTION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE BODY CHAPTER ONE THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most men today consider man as being made up of two parts: the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The soul is the invisible part, the psychological part within man, and the body is the visible part, the outward form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is man's fallen concept.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there is some ground to it, it is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Outside of God's revelation, no ideas in this world are reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is, of course, true that the body is the outward shell of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Bible never mixes the soul with the spirit or considers the two as the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to being different terms, the soul and the spirit are actually two different substances; they are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Word of God has not divided man into two parts, the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it has divided man into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse clearly divides a person into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the apostle mentioned the believers' being sanctified "wholly."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the whole being of the believers is to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What did he mean when he said that a person is to be sanctified wholly?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He meant that a person's spirit, soul, and body are to be preserved complete.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is very clear; a complete person has a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse also tells us clearly that there is a distinction between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, it would not have said "your spirit and soul."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, it would have said "your spirit-soul."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since God has spoken this, we can see that there is a distinction between man's spirit and his soul, and from this we can conclude that man is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the significance of distinguishing the spirit from the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has much to do with the spiritual life of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If believers do not know the boundary of their spirits, how can they understand the spiritual life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they do not understand the spiritual life, how can they grow in their spiritual living?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because believers are either negligent or ignorant of the distinction between the spirit and the soul, they never grow in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, many times they take something soulish as spiritual, constantly remain in a soulish living, and do not seek after spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we mix up what God has separated, we are bound to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spiritual knowledge has much to do with the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the most important thing is whether or not a believer is willing to be humble and to receive the teaching of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he is, the Holy Spirit will, in his experience, separate his soul from his spirit, though he may not even have the knowledge about this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A believer with very little knowledge concerning the distinction between the soul and the spirit can experience the difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, a very knowledgeable believer may be well acquainted with the truth about the distinction between the soul and the spirit, and yet be without any experience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is best that one has both the knowledge as well as the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most believers are lacking in the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why it is good to let them know the different functions of the soul and the spirit so that they will seek after spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only does 1 Thessalonians divide man into three parts; other passages in the Scripture do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the apostle divided the non-physical elements of man into two parts, the soul and the spirit, and he considered the physical part of man to include the joints and the marrow, which correspond to the mind and will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as a priest divided up a whole sacrifice and cut it apart with a knife so that nothing remained hidden, in the same way the Lord Jesus divides those who belong to Him, through the word of God; He pierces and divides every part, whether it be the spiritual, the soulish, or the physical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the soul and the spirit can be divided, the two must not be the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, this portion of the Word also considers man to be composed of three elements: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the versions of the Bible we ordinarily use do not follow a literal translation of the words "spirit" and "soul" in a strict way, readers find it difficult to differentiate between the two just by looking at the translated words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In translating the Bible, we should translate these words literally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When men in the world translate books, they invent many new terms.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why cannot the translation of the most widely circulated Book do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since God has used two different terms for the spirit and the soul, we should not confuse them.</S>
