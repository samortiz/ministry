   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the New Testament Peter spoke of the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He showed us what it is: "Having eyes full of adultery and not ceasing from sin; enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised for covetousness, children of curse" 2 Pet 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the emphasis is on the habitual exercise of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Covetousness is a matter of the heart, yet it can become a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a man is taken over by covetousness once, twice, or many times, his covetousness becomes his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness" v. 15 . What happens when a person falls into habitual covetousness? He forsakes the straight way, goes astray, and follows the way of Balaam, the son of Beor! Brothers and sisters, God has set before us "the straight way." Which way should we go? Some have forsaken the straight way, gone astray, and followed the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is "the way of Balaam"?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a prophet who loved the wages of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows us clearly that the way of Balaam is a way that involves the selling of one's prophetic ministry for a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the gospel is not sold, and the prophetic ministry is not sold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can neither sell God's gospel nor the ministry of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet here was a person who sold his prophetic ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His way was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His heart was filled with covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason he went astray as soon as temptation came.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Balaam did not accept Balak's offer as a result of one thought of covetousness; it was the result of habitual coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this point?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the reason he went astray as soon as Balak offered him the money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the power of mammon is not eradicated from us, our feet will run after it as soon as its bait is dangled before us, and we will sacrifice our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we want to run a straight course, we have to deny mammon absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, we outwardly may be seeking for leading, praying for guidance, and pursuing God's will while our feet remain on the wrong path.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Balaam prayed, pursued God's will, and waited on God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet he still took the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember that as long as money occupies a place in our heart and covetousness becomes a habit, we can pray all we want for God to stop us from going to a certain place, but money will eventually direct our footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will be unable to run a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jude also speaks of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 11 says, "For they have...rushed out in the error of Balaam for reward."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are strong words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have rushed out for reward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To rush means to run quickly, speedily, and hurriedly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have rushed out in the error of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's children have to be fully delivered from the enticement of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, they will have no choice but the way of error.</S>
