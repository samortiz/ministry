   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has spoken in the Son, and the Son is God; this indicates that God speaks in Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are considered as one in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today God is speaking through a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the Son mentioned in Hebrews 1:2 is corporate.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before His crucifixion and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was restricted by the flesh; it was not possible for Him to be universal.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the day of Pentecost Christ came down as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples to make them members of His Body.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now, just as our whole body speaks whenever we speak, so the Body of Christ speaks whenever Christ speaks as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today the Son of God is no longer merely an individual; He is a corporate, universal man.</S>
