   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WILL NOT BEING ABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WITHSTAND THE LAW OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The statistics of sin are the cumulative experiences of all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they are exhibited before our eyes, we can do nothing but bow down and confess our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul struggled so hard that he eventually discovered sin to be a law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sin is not something accidental or incidental; it happens spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unless many people first experience the "I find..." in 7:21, they can never have the "thanks be to God" in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without discovering this, they find themselves going around in circles for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man can have a tooth removed when it bothers him, but he cannot get rid of a law with an operation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, consider the traffic lights at a crossroad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You can run the red light once, twice, or many times without being caught by the police.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But you cannot run the red lights all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sooner or later you will be caught by the police.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Halting at a red light is a law, and one cannot forever go against this law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sin is not the result of an accidental weakness in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not try to fight with sin, because sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This law of sin is very real within man, and it is impossible for man to overcome the law of sin with his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once you realize that sin is a law, you should no longer try to fight it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you try to fight it, you will lose because a law cannot change; it remains the same forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 6 and 7 are the foundation for spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless sin is dealt with, nothing can be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet it is impossible for us to overcome sin by our will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A man can hold up a hymnal by his will, but he cannot do this forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the beginning he may not feel the weight of it, but gradually it becomes heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, the hymnal has not increased in weight, but the force of gravity operates on the hand and wears it out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you try to be good and love others by yourself, you will be like the hand in the illustration above.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sooner or later you will become tired, and sooner or later you will have to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a losing prop- osition to fight the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also a losing proposition to counter this evil law with our good will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our need today is to acknowledge our corruption in Adam and our newness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE WAY OF DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way of deliverance is to realize that sin is a never-changing law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we lose hope in ourselves, we will breathe a sigh of relief just like Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Salvation does not depend on any resolution we make within ourselves; it depends on our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law of sin has no effect on our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is not only free from sin; He is a sinless man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Him there is no law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today this Christ lives within us as our life, and we have a new law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law of sin does not exist in Christ; He is like a helium balloon that is constantly ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can hold down a helium balloon for a while, but we cannot hold it down forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today Christ lives within us, and there is a new life and a new law that overcomes the law of the will of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet many people have not yet discovered this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is like a person who has never opened a gift that he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very precious to realize the blessings that come from a genuine regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we have received is not just a life, but a new law, and this law is able to overcome the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One brother once remarked, "When I exercise my will, I lose my temper less and sin less.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not exercising my will would be unthinkable."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this is not the Christian way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Christian way is not in the exercise of the will, but in the discovery of another law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the illustration of the hymnal and the hand, it matters little where you put the hymnal; the law of gravity operates everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are not regenerated, it is true that you should not let go of your will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You must control yourself before you can behave in a more proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once you let go, you will sin, just as the force of gravity will act on any object that is placed in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A regenerated Christian, however, will not need to struggle or strive to do good or to free himself from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a law within him, the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A Christian first discovers the law of sin and then the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without discovering the law of sin, one cannot discover the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today many people do not know that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result they do not know anything about the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am not merely teaching; I am helping you to know this law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First we must realize that sin is a law, and then we must realize the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the way we will overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Prayer: Lord, in the past we considered sins to be isolated events and countable acts of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We did not realize that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today we have seen that these seemingly isolated sins are actually a law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Lord, these words may be repetitious, but may those who have heard them receive blessing from them.</S>
