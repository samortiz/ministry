"After that" here means after being fully consecrated to the Lord (vv. 13-14). God does not want us to work for Him before we are fully His. If He has not gained our life, He will not want our work.</P><P>"Offer them as a wave offering." Notice the order here: (1) the atonement-this is our salvation; (2) offer up as a wave offering-this is our consecration; (3) "to Me"-this is the Lord's acceptance; (4) caring for the things of the tabernacle-this is our work of service to the Lord; (5) offer up as a wave offering-this is the second time that they are offered. Is one time not enough? Indeed, we should consecrate ourselves to God all the time. Before we work we have to consecrate, and while we work we also have to consecrate. "Cleanse...offer"-Consecration has much to do with the Lord's holiness.</P><P>Verse 16:"For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel; instead of all that open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them for Myself." "Wholly"-may the Lord gain us wholly!</P><P>Verse 17:"For all the firstborn among the sons of Israel are Mine, both of man and of beast, on the day that I slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself." According to the law, when the Lord has redeemed us and purchased us unto Himself, we belong to Him (1 Cor. 6:19-20).</P><P>Verse 19:"And I have given the Levites as ones given to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make propitiation for the sons of Israel, that there may be no plague among the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel  approach the sanctuary." We are God's gift to Christ (John 17:6, 9).</P><P>Verse 24:"This is what pertains to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and above they shall go in to serve in the service of the tent of meeting." Five is the number of man's responsibility before God. The Levites began to serve from the age of twenty-five (five times five), which means that they began working after they were fully ready to take up responsibility (five fives). The period of working was also five times five, which is twenty-five years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROVERBS 16</H2><P>Verse 1:"The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord." The Lord can control our tongues!</P><P>Verse 3:"Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established." Commitment is an act of faith.</P><P>Verse 6:"By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil." The fear of the Lord is expressed in departing from evil.</P><P>Verse 30:"He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass." Although Proverbs for the most part teaches us to be few in words, sometimes what we say by not speaking is more evil!</P><P>Verse 32:"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." "Better than the mighty"-because one has overcome himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 1</H2><P>Verse 4: "Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust." To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be regenerated. Since a person is regenerated, he should also develop this regenerated life. "For this very reason also, adding all diligence..." (v. 5).</P><P>Verse 11:"For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you." In the future, in the glory of the kingdom, believers will be divided into at least two categories: (1) those who are merely saved (1 Pet. 4:18) and (2) those to whom the entrance into the kingdom of our Lord will be richly and bountifully supplied.</P><P>Verse 13:"And I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder." Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 90</div><br></body></html>
