<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SAINTS’ LOVE FOR  THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalm 84</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 84:1-12</h1><p>In Book II we have reached the highest peak, with the house and the city as the stepping-stone for the Lord to regain the earth. But we still need more, for by the end of Book II we have only seen the positive side. There is also the negative aspect. Following the day, we have the night; therefore, after Book II we have Book III, revealing the possibility of losing the enjoyment of the house and city of God.<p>How wonderful it is to be in the house and in the city, but we must realize that it is possible for this sweet enjoyment to be lost. There is even something which will affect us in a more personal way than this: at a certain point God will take away even all our material blessings; we will be stripped. According to our past experiences, this is exactly what has happened. After we have come to the local church and enjoyed it greatly, the stripping hand of God has come to take away many things. How contrary this experience is to our religious concept! In religion we are told that if we love the Lord, we will be healthy and prosper in every way. We have taught others and have even taught our children in this way. I would not say that this concept is either wrong or right, but that it is wholly religious. If it is right, it is religiously right. According to our experience, however, we can testify that, when we love the Lord, He begins gradually to strip us of many things. I myself have gone through the very experience of the Psalmist in Psalm 73. While I was suffering and being stripped, I looked at others in the world with their prosperity, and I asked the Lord, “What is this?” Sooner or later, perhaps not today, but someday the Lord will begin to take away, even from the young brothers and sisters who love Him, all the good things. The Lord will strip you. Not until you go into the sanctuary will you understand. He strips us that we may enjoy Himself in an absolute way. This is the first aspect of the Psalms in Book III. When we learn to say with the Psalmist, “Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee,” we have made a real improvement.<p>The second aspect of Book III is that among the Lord’s children we must continually give Christ the pre-eminence. If the Man at the right hand of God is not given His rightful position, we will have a problem with the house of God and lose the enjoyment of the local church. The right hand of God is the first place in the entire universe, and that is the position we must give Christ in the church life. This brings in the restoration, which swallows up all the desolation in the local churches.<h2 class=head1>A DEEPER LOVE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 84, which depicts how the saints love the house of God and desire to dwell therein. Surely by now we can say with the Psalmist in verse 1, “How lovely are thy dwelling places!” There is not only one dwelling place, but many dwelling places. No doubt these dwelling places signify the local churches. The local churches can be so lovely to us; we can even be homesick for them. Many of you have been in the local churches for only a short time, perhaps not more than a year or two. This is a honeymoon. The honeymoon will not last too long. But after all the desolation and negative experiences are past, you will sense that the house of God is much more lovely than it ever was when you first came into it.<p>I can never forget my first five years in the local church—it was a real honeymoon. I felt that every day was so wonderful. Indeed, it seemed that my honeymoon with the local church would never end. But one day the trial came: it was a real problem, and the entire church was nearly swept away by it. Then, for almost ten years, one trial after another came upon the local churches. But, praise the Lord, after all these difficult experiences, the local church became sweeter and more lovable to me than ever before.<p>Psalm 84 does not precede the stripping and the desolation of God’s house, but follows it. After the stripping and desolation, in the recovery and restoration, the house of God is sweeter than ever before. How lovable are the dwelling places of God! Young brothers and sisters, keep this in mind: if the Lord delays, you will see ten years from now how much sweeter the local churches are to you than they are today. I cannot tell you how lovable they are to me. In John chapter two we read about the best wine. But, I tell you, in my experience the local churches are better and sweeter than the very best wine.<p>If I could check with the sisters concerning the love they have for their husbands, I believe many would testify that the love they now have, after going through many trials and experiences together, is stronger, deeper, and sweeter than the love of their honeymoon. Over the years and through many trials they have built up a love so strong that nothing can break it.<p>The love in Psalm 84 is not a honeymoon love; it is a love which follows many trials. It is not the love of Psalm 26:8 (“Lord, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth”), nor is it the love of Psalm 27:4 (“One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple”). In the church life there is the honeymoon period, and there is the period following many experiences and trials. In Psalm 84 we have a hint of the trials: “Passing through the valley of weeping, (they) make it a place of springs…” (v. 6). This is not initial love; this is love matured through many trials. It requires some years to come to this point. Keep in mind that Psalm 84 is not in the first book of the Psalms, but in the third book. It is not only long after the honeymoon, but it even follows an extended time of “married life.” After a certain period of trials, we can testify how lovable the local churches are.
