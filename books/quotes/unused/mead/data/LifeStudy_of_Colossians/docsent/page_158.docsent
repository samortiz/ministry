   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO HAVING BEEN ROOTED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BEING BUILT UP IN HIM 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:7a, 19; 3:10-11; 1 Cor 3:6, 9; 6:17; Eph 2:21; 4:13b, 15-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In reading or studying the Bible, it is easy to take things for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may read a verse such as 2:7, which speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him, and we may assume that we understand it, when actually our understanding is very superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same may be true even of verses such as John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, we have some understanding of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But, on the other hand, we may take very much for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, in reading the Bible we may have the tendency to avoid difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may prefer not to dig into certain verses, pray about them, and ask the Lord to open them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we consider a number of verses from Colossians, 1 Corinthians, and Ephesians, we should not take things for granted, and we should not avoid any difficulty presented by these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular, my burden is for us to see the implications in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ROOTED, GROWING, AND BEING BUILT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:7 Paul speaks of having been rooted and being built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word rooted is very rich in its implications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be rooted is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A plant that has been rooted in the soil grows in the earth and even into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a living organism which grows in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If, on the contrary, a dead stick is thrust into the earth, that stick cannot be said to be rooted in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the roots of a plant spread into the soil, they absorb the riches from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The nourishment that is absorbed into the plant becomes the very element by which the plant grows.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for a plant to grow, it must receive through the roots a certain substance or element.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is by this substance that the plant increases in size.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As believers, we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This implies that we are living organisms, not lifeless and rootless sticks thrust into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we have been rooted in Christ, we now may absorb the riches of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These riches, absorbed from Christ as the soil, become the very element which enables us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Colossians 2:7 speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more a plant grows, the more it builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A tree, for example, builds itself up by absorbing into itself nourishment from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This implies organic activity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through this activity the nourishment from the soil is absorbed into the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant that in 2:7 Paul puts being rooted and building together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason for this is that being rooted is for growing, and growing is genuine building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Growth is not only for building, but is actually the building itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a tree grows, it builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same is true of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As all mothers realize, the more their children are nourished with healthy food, the more they grow, and by growing, they are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The organic activity that takes place within them causes them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This growth is the building of their physical bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being rooted brings in the growing, and the growing is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not grow, we cannot have any building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We grow by absorbing the rich, nourishing element of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having been rooted in Christ, we now are being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have been rooted in Christ, and we grow by absorbing His riches into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This leads to growth, which is the building up of ourselves in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>HOLDING THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 2:19 Paul speaks of holding the Head, out from Whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Holding the Head is equal to abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, to hold the Head implies that we are not detached, or severed, from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the time Paul wrote to the Colossians, they had been somewhat detached from Christ by their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Culture can be a form of insulation which keeps us from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To hold the Head is to remain in Christ without any insulation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The words out from Whom in verse 19 indicate that something is coming out from the Head to cause the Body to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head, just as the growth of a plant depends on what comes into the plant from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a plant does not absorb nutrients from the soil, the plant cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Likewise, if we do not receive what comes out from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Holding the Head is, therefore, equal to being rooted in Christ as the soil.</S>
