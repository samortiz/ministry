<p>We must also pray if we want God to flow out of us in order to supply others. It is through prayer that the living water of life can flow into us, and it is also through prayer that this living water of life can flow out of us. Our spirit is weak, and we are short of the supply for others because we do not pray enough. The primary purpose of prayer is for us to exercise our spirit and absorb God. Asking for things is secondary. For example, when we play basketball, our primary concern is to exercise our body; whether or not we win is secondary. Likewise, prayer is primarily for us to exercise our spirit. Sometimes our prayers will be answered, but that is not always the case. God often does not answer our prayers according to our desire. However, whether or not our prayers are answered is secondary. The fact is that we have prayed and thus exercised our spirit. When our spirit is strengthened, we can supply others whenever we open our mouths.</p>
<p>In order for the brothers to have a strong spirit while they give a message, they cannot be short of prayer in their daily life. A brother who lacks prayer and does not exercise his spirit to contact God in his daily life will not have a living, strong, and released spirit when he ministers the word. This is a law. Athletes who run daily are swift when there is a need to run. Those who train in boxing can hit someone with force when there is a need. Likewise, if the brothers would pray daily, their spirit would be strong and released when they stand up to give a message, and they would be able to touch the saints. The brothers who minister the word must not rely on eloquence or knowledge. They must pray daily so that their spirit is strong and enriched.</p>
<p>The early apostles prayed. They said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). The apostles continued steadfastly in prayer. They placed prayer before the ministry of the word. This shows that in their feeling, prayer was more fundamental and more important than the ministry of the word. They prayed not only to ask God to manifest His power, to save souls, and to bless His work but also to exercise their spirit. In Acts the apostles prayed steadfastly day by day. Hence, it is not a wonder that their spirit was uplifted and prevailing. When they stood up to speak, their spirit was released.</p>
<p>Just as we need to exercise our spirit in order to give a message, we need to exercise our spirit in order to supply the saints through visiting them and fellowshipping with them. We need prayer to receive the Spirit, and we also need prayer for the Spirit to be released. This is the only way for the church to be built. If we are not delivered to spend more time to pray, God will not be able to do anything among us. As a result, the messages we give concerning building will touch only the minds of the saints, and God will not have the real building of the church. Therefore, we must exercise our spirit in prayer. We must function as priests by being strengthened in our spirit through constant exercise so that we can release our spirit in any situation. This is the way for the church to be built up. The building up of the church depends on the prayer of the priesthood. A praying church is a built-up church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE MOVING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we want the Spirit to move in us, we must not wait passively. Ten years ago I exhorted the saints to pray according to the move of the Spirit. However, we cannot find a verse in the Bible that tells us to wait until we are moved by the Spirit before we pray. On the contrary, 1 Thessalonians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo; It is not a matter of waiting for the Spirit to move us. The Spirit is constantly moving in us. It is a matter of not quenching the move of the Spirit. There are other verses in the Bible, such as Romans 12:11, &ldquo;Be burning in spirit,&rdquo; and Ephesians 5:18, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit,&rdquo; which are concerning the move of the Spirit. The word <em>be</em> in these verses indicates that we must be active in order to be burning or filled in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE WELL IN ORDER<br />
FOR THE LIVING WATER TO FLOW OUT</h2>
<p>Being filled in spirit refers to the flowing of living water from within us. In the Old Testament, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, they often encountered the problem of a shortage of water. Shortly after they crossed the Red Sea, they came to Marah and to the twelve springs of water at Elim (Exo. 15:22-27). At Meribah Moses struck the rock, and water flowed out (17:1-7). In Numbers 20:2-13 the children of Israel encountered a shortage of water again, and God instructed Moses to speak to the rock so that it would yield its water for the people to drink. In verses 16 through 18 of chapter 21 the children of Israel came to Beer. On this occasion they did not strike the rock, nor were there visible springs. Rather, they dug a well for water to spring up. On one hand, they used the scepter and their staffs to dig the well; on the other hand, they sang, &ldquo;Spring up, O well!&rdquo; Many Bible students pay attention to the twelve springs at Elim and to the water that flowed out of the smitten rock, but they neglect the digging of the well in Beer. We are focusing on the type of digging a well in order to get water. We are not concerned with the springs at Elim or with striking the rock. The rock has been cleft, and the springs are flowing into us. Our present need is to dig the well. We must dig until the living water springs up.</p>
<p>Digging the well does not refer to seeking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit only in Acts, not in the Epistles. The spirit that is spoken of numerous times in the Epistles does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the mingled spirit, that is, God&rsquo;s Spirit mingled with our spirit. For example, Romans 8:4 speaks of walking according to the spirit. The word <em>spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of God mingled with the spirit of man, that is, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit. We can say confidently that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is not referred to in the Epistles. Romans 5:5 says, &ldquo;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.&rdquo; There is a distinction between the love of God being poured out through the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit being poured out upon the believers. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit recorded in Acts was outward, upon the believers, just like water covering people outwardly so that they are submerged in water. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was an extraordinary experience, not a daily matter. It was something done by God to meet a particular need. Now God is in our spirit as the spring of living water. We do not need to search for outward springs or to strike the rock, nor do we need to wait for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We need only to dig the well, to open a hole in our being, so that the spring of water hidden in our spirit will flow out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Digging the Well through Prayer</h2>
<p>We dig the well through prayer. The more thoroughly we pray, the deeper we dig. Ephesians speaks of being filled in spirit (5:18) and of &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (6:18). In order to be filled in spirit, we need to pray in spirit. If we want our spirit to be strong and released so that God can flow out of us, we must exercise our spirit through prayer daily. Then our spirit will be strong, and we will be able to express the sense within our spirit. If we would be faithful to exercise our spirit, in a short time our spirit will be released, and living waters will flow out. Moreover, we will be able to supply the saints and lead them to release their spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINGING HYMNS TO MATCH OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>Besides exercising our spirit to pray, we must exercise to sing hymns. There is often the need to sing hymns that match our prayer in order for our spirit to be released. We have not practiced singing regularly, so we do not know how to sing in the meetings. Singing greatly affects the release of the spirit. Hence, we need to diligently practice singing in order to make up for our lack. Although it is difficult for those who are over forty years old to learn to sing, it is still better for them to learn and to practice. We do not require the saints to become vocalists, but we hope that everyone will be willing to learn in humility. After a period of time, we will see some improvement. We particularly need to learn to sing with our spirit the new hymns that are frequently called in the meetings. Giving a message and listening to a message both involve the mind, but genuine prayer and singing involve the exercise of the spirit. It is through praying and singing that our spirit can be released. At least one-third of our meetings depends on singing hymns. This is particularly true concerning the bread-breaking meeting. If we cannot sing a hymn well, the spirit of the meeting will be dampened. Conversely, if we can sing a hymn well, the entire meeting will be uplifted. I believe that we have experienced this.</p>
<p>If we want to have a strong spirit, we must exercise to pray and sing more. Formerly, we used mainly our mind to listen to messages and to study them. Now we must have a change&mdash;we must use our spirit more than our mind in order to pray and to sing the hymns. It is not enough to merely utter words clearly or to sing with a loud voice. Our spirit must come out with the words we utter and with our voice when we sing. This is the way to have a strong spirit and to release the spirit of the saints. This is also the way for living waters to flow among us and for the church to be built.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
