Our meetings are living; that is, they are full of the enjoyment and expression of the divine life, which we as the children of God possess
These meetings are for nourishing the new ones and are held in the homes of the saints or of our newly saved believing friends
We meet in homes at least weekly so that we may lead our relatives, neighbors, friends, and colleagues to accept the Lord's salvation
Once they are saved, we continue to meet with them in the homes in order to nourish them and help them grow in the Christian life
During these times, we help the new ones to enjoy the Lord through prayer, singing, fellowship, and Bible reading and study
These perfecting meetings are also held in the homes of the saints and consist of around ten to fifteen brothers and sisters
These meetings are characterized by much mutuality in teaching, questioning, answering, shepherding, interceding, and caring
In the intimate fellowship of these meetings, we can be corrected by others in love so that we can be perfected in our function
The church, as the pillar and base of the truth , meets together to express the Lord corporately in its locality
The apostle Paul also speaks of another kind of church meeting in his first Epistle to the Corinthians: 'What then, brothers?
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
According to the pattern of the New Testament, we also have meetings for the release of the New Testament ministry
A degree of perfecting occurs in these ministry meetings that cannot be attained in any other meetings of the saints
