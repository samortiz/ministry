In saving us and in building up a relationship with us, God came to visit us personally and affectionately. How personal and affectionate Jesus was in the Gospels! But this was His visitation to His chosen people in the physical life. He was a man physically, but was not yet the Spirit. </p><p>One day He told His disciples of His intention to die. They could not understand this. They thought that He had come to build up the kingdom of God and that they would be with Him on the throne. James and John wanted to sit at His right and left in His kingdom. When the other ten heard this, they were indignant, showing that they also were ambitious to be with the Lord on the throne (Matt. 20:20-28). They were in the physical realm.</p><p>Through His death and in His resurrection, He became &ldquo;another kind of Jesus.&rdquo; He was no longer physical, because He became a life-giving Christ, a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam, who was Jesus in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). I would like to ask, &ldquo;Are you still preaching and ministering a physical Jesus or a pneumatic Christ?&rdquo; Mostly, those in Christianity preach a physical Savior, but the Bible unveils to us that this physical Savior, after He accomplished God&rsquo;s full redemption through His death, changed into a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. They do not believe that Christ has become another kind of Person, not physical but spiritual.</p><p>When Christ was in the flesh, He could visit His disciples outwardly and openly, but there was no possibility for Him to visit His disciples inwardly and privately. Today Christ visits us privately and spiritually because He is the life-giving, compound, consummated, all-inclusive Spirit. He is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, so He visits people secretly, privately, not openly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KING, CHRIST, BRINGING US INTO<br />HIS INNER CHAMBERS, OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT</h2><p>First, in Song of Songs the Lord captivates His seeker, and she with all her companions follows Him. To pursue Christ for satisfaction is the first &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; in Song of Songs. The second crystal is the King bringing His seeker into His inner chambers. Song of Songs is a book of figures. In a figure of speech, the king&lsquo;s inner chambers signify our regenerated spirit as Christ&rsquo;s inner chambers.</p><p>God created man that man may become Him by His being received by man so that He can enter into and stay in man. For this reason God created us with a spirit. According to the New Testament teaching, our regenerated spirit is not only for us to have a means to receive Him but also for us to contain Him. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:16 says that we need to be strengthened into our inner man. The inner man is our regenerated spirit. Ephesians 2:22 shows that our spirit is a habitation, a dwelling place, to God. The real inner chambers to God are our spirit.</p><p>Regretfully, the majority of Christians in today&rsquo;s Christianity do not believe that there is such a thing as the human spirit. They say that the human spirit is synonymous with man&rsquo;s soul or heart. The Chinese translation of the Bible mixes up the heart, the soul, and the spirit by using the terms &ldquo;spirit-soul&rdquo; or &ldquo;heart-spirit.&rdquo; Not many Christians today know definitely that they have a spirit. When I came to the United States in the early 1960s I began to teach concerning the human spirit. Many told me that before I taught this, they never knew that they had a spirit.</p><p>There are three verses in the New Testament that show the divine Spirit and the regenerated human spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; In this verse are God the Spirit and our spirit, with which we worship God the Spirit. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; I came to the United States with a burden to release all the high-peak truths. One among these is the human spirit. Another is that Christ, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our human spirit, and these two spirits are mingled together to be one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p><p>In this message we want to stress the words <i>private</i> and <i>spiritual</i>. Christianity preaches the physical Jesus, but we preach the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This One is private and spiritual. We have seen that the king&lsquo;s chambers signify our spirit. He visits us in our spirit privately, and He comes to us in a spiritual way, not a physical way. He visits us privately as the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit.</p><p>Christ the King brings His seekers into His chambers, that is into their regenerated spirit, His dwelling place. Let us consider the application of this. When I was young, I was taught to pray to God as the heavenly Father. I was also told not to pray to the Spirit, because in the entire New Testament you cannot find a verse concerning praying to the Spirit. But the more we pray, the more we have the feeling that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us (Eph. 4:6; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9). According to our experience, our spirit is the Holy of Holies&mdash;the dwelling place, the inner chambers, of the Triune God. In this first chapter of Song of Songs He and we have the private and affectionate fellowship.</p><p>The seeker in Song of Songs prayed, &ldquo;Draw me; we will run after you.&rdquo; Then the king drew her and she followed, but she did not know where to go. The King knows where to go. We must go to our spirit. The inner chambers of Christ are His lovers&rsquo; regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11) and are the practical Holy of Holies in Christ&rsquo;s lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God (Heb. 4:16).</p><p>After we were saved we began to pray and eventually we realized that the heavenly Father, the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit are all in us. But at that time we did not know in what part of our being the Triune God dwelt. We did not know that we had a human spirit, but gradually we found out that the Triune God dwells in our regenerated spirit. The seeker followed the Lord, and He immediately brought her to her regenerated spirit to have fellowship with Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
