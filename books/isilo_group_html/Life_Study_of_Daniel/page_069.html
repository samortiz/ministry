THE CONTENTS OF THIS VISION</H2><P>The contents of this vision concern the destiny of Israel from the last part of the kingdom of Persia to the last three and a half years of the present age, even including the kingdom age and eternity, as the truth that was inscribed in the writing of truth (10:21) told to Daniel by the angelic messenger (11:2&#151;12:13).</P><P>The vision in chapter eleven covers the details of the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire to its very end under Antichrist. As we will see, shortly after defeating the kingdom of Persia, Alexander the Great died, and his kingdom was divided into four kingdoms under his four generals. Two of these kingdoms, Egypt and Syria, fought wars back and forth through the land of Israel. Eventually, this chapter stresses the kingdoms and evils of two kings: Antiochus Epiphanes, one of the kings of the north (vv. 21-35), and Antichrist, the king of the restored Roman Empire (vv. 36-45).</P><P>I would emphasize once again that the great human image in Daniel 2 is the controlling factor of the entire prophecy of this book. This means that the principle of Daniel's prophecy is to cover the entire human image from the head (Babylon) to the toes (Antichrist with the ten kings). We may say that the first five chapters of Daniel give us a full definition and description of the Babylonian Empire. Chapter six begins to speak concerning the Persian Empire. In chapter seven we have a sketch of the four beasts, which from another angle portray the empires signified by the various parts of the great image. The ram in chapter eight refers to the Persian Empire, and the goat, to the Grecian Empire. In chapter nine Daniel received the vision of the seventy weeks, and in chapter ten, the vision concerning the excellent Christ, the One who is the centrality and universality of God's move. Chapter eleven provides further details regarding the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the restored Roman Empire under Antichrist during the last three and a half years of this age. From this we see that the book of Daniel covers the entire human government from the Babylonian Empire to the Roman Empire. In keeping with this principle, chapter eleven does not stop with the Grecian Empire but includes a word about Antichrist, the king of the restored Roman Empire.</P><P>Daniel 11 speaks first of the type, Antiochus Epiphanes, and then of the fulfillment of that type, Antichrist. This is according to the principle found in 9:26-27. Verse 26a speaks of Christ's crucifixion. Then the rest of the verse refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by Titus and his army in A.D. 70. However, the next verse refers not to Titus but to Antichrist, the one who makes "a firm covenant with the many for one week." In 9:26-27 first the type is revealed, then the fulfillment. The principle is the same concerning Antiochus Epiphanes and Antichrist in chapter eleven.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Daniel &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
