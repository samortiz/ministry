   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Seventeen MAN S RELIGION AND GOD S SAVING WAY Scripture: Gen 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not easy to give a clear picture of salvation by using the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis 4 as a gospel subject, because the main points are usually missed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if you use Man s Religion and God s Saving Way as the subject for this portion, it will be easy for you to speak, because the story of Cain speaks of man s religion, and that of Abel speaks of God s saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This subject is divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is better to give it in two meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man s religion The origin of man s religion is that it was invented by man s concept in his presumptions about God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Any human religion is invented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should talk about the origin of each so-called religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man is made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because man has a spirit within him, there is always within man an inclination toward worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So there is a concept of God within all men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man has invented ways to worship God based upon this concept of God within himself, and this invention is called religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meaning of man s religion is that it is a teaching according to something or someone that is worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On one hand, you teach yourself, and on the other hand, you teach others how to worship God and behave as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Worship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is always an object of worship, either a god, a person, or some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the five main religions, two worship God Christianity and Islam , and three worship a person: Confucianism worships Confucius, Buddhism worships Siddhartha Gautama, and Taoism worships Lao-tzu.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to teach others, according to what you worship, how to worship God and behave as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The central point and main emphasis of man s religion is to cultivate moral conduct by human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The central point of any religion is to cultivate moral conduct by human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this respect Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism and Islam are all very similar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even today s Christianity as it is generally understood is no different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man s religion has the hope of achieving a good result by means of human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All religions hold out the hope of somehow earning a future reward based on the merits of good works.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hope of all who practice cultivating moral conduct is to achieve some kind of immortality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, for a Buddhist, this would mean to become a Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within man s religion is a hidden motivation which is a part of the Devil s scheme to damage God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The central point of all religions is to cultivate moral conduct by human effort and to exhort others to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God does not care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many think that the central point of Christianity also is to exhort others to do good, but people must know that to do good is not God s saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The central point of all religions is the confusion of Satan to cover up God s saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All who pay attention to the central point of any religion are cheated by Satan and are damaged in relation to God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three points fully expose the hidden motivation of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a presentation is attractive as well as persuasive, opening up an understanding of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The destiny of those in man s religion is that they are not accepted by God, and they are fallen into sinfulness and destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those who rely on the central point of religion to please God are not accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may use Cain as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who rely on the central point of religion cannot have fellowship with God; instead, they are farther away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result is to become more and more sinful, and the end is destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These three points should be based upon the story of Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His offering of the produce of the field to God is to cultivate moral conduct by human effort, and the result was threefold: he was not accepted by God, he was farther away from God, and later he committed murder and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s saving way The origin of God s saving way is by God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Human religion was man s invention, but God s saving way came by God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should repeat this until people see that religion is man s invention, but the saving way is by God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a revelation is something never thought of by man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever man can think of is totally a matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Explain that what Abel did was not a matter of religion but something by God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should make it clear that Cain s method or way of worshipping God came out of his own presumptions; thus it was his own invention, so that what he did was religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What Abel did was not of his own guesswork or invention but of God s revelation, which he had learned through his parents, Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After Adam and Eve sinned, God killed an animal, and He clothed them with the skin of the animal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam and Eve must have told Abel about this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hebrews 11 says that Abel offered up sacrifices by faith, and Romans 10 says that faith is by hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It can be seen that Abel s faith came by hearing from his parents, and therefore what Abel did came out of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The origin of religion requires no faith, but the origin of the saving way requires faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because religion was invented by man, you only need to guess a little.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only God s saving way is God s revelation; therefore it requires faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Guessing will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The meaning of God s saving way is to serve God based upon God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The meaning of religion is to belong to a sect and be taught accordingly, but the meaning of the saving way is to serve God based upon God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the saving way, there is the experience of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s salvation is to cause us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We serve Him not by a teaching, but by the salvation we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God s salvation is to save us to such an extent that we can serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The central point of God s saving way is the redemption of Christ and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Explain how man has committed sins and how the problem of sins must be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The problem of sins cannot be dealt with no matter how much man tries to cultivate moral conduct and to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only by the death of Christ and His shed blood can man s sins be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once we believe in Him, His Spirit and His life will enter into us to be our power and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Compare the central points of religion and of the saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The central point of religion is to cultivate moral conduct and to do good, which cannot 1 resolve the problem of the sins committed in the past; 2 and much less save man from sin and enable him to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In contrast, the central point of the saving way is Christ s redemption and salvation, by which 1 the problem of our past sins can be resolved through redemption; and 2 we are enabled to overcome sin and to be free from sins through salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The hidden meaning of God s saving way is the fulfillment of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s saving way implies the fulfillment of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God has His strategy and arrangement, and these make up His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God s plan is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The way God works Himself into man is by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To receive God s saving way to believe in Christ is to receive God s life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The destiny of those who receive God s saving way is to be accepted by God and delivered from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The redemption of Christ is by the blood of Christ; the salvation of Christ is by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We can be accepted by God only by having the blood and the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Abel was accepted by God not by his own merit, but by the animal that was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>That animal typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Being accepted by God enables us to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God s saving way delivers us from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Abel suffered persecution; yet he did not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He was killed; yet he did not perish.</S>
