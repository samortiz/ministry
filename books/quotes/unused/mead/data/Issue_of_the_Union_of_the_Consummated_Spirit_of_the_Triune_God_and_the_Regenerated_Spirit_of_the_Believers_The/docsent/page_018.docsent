   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. This Is the Mass Reproduction of</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Firstborn Son of God as the Prototype</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Make Every Believer a God-man Just Like Christ, the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The transformation of the believers is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man to make every believer a God-man just like Christ, the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Spirit of God transforms the believers into the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we can see that in the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation, the Spirit of God is working step by step in our human spirit to make us God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN CONFORMING THE BELIEVERS A. Being the Consummation of</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>the Transformation of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in the Life of Christ as the Firstborn</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Son of God, the First God-man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is also seen in the conforming of the believers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, which is just the consummation of the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is that we are made God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Being Also the Preparation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>of the Believers before the Transfiguration</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>and Glorification of Their Body</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Conformation is also the preparation of the believers before the transfiguration and glorification of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philippians 3:21 says that when Christ returns, He "will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what is mentioned in Romans and Ephesians as the redemption of our body Rom 8:23; Eph 1:14; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The transfiguration of our body, or the redemption of our body, is not something accomplished instantly; it is the issue of the gradual working of the Spirit of God within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This working begins with regeneration, passes through sanctification, renewing, and transformation, and arrives at conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the consummation of our transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Conformation can be likened to a college graduation; glorification can be likened to the graduation ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person does not grow and is not transformed, when the Lord comes back, it will be impossible for him to be transformed instantly to arrive at conformation and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, conformation is the consummation of our transformation in life as well as the preparation before the transfiguration and glorification of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN GLORIFYING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is seen consummately in the glorifying of the believers Rom 8:30, 23; Eph 4:30; Col 3:4b; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Tim 2:10; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers begins with His regenerating the believers with the life of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After regenerating the believers, the Spirit of God continues, step by step, with His work of sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming to transfuse the believers with the Triune God Himself as glory, until the glory of God's life saturates the believers and is manifested in their body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus the work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers reaches its ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The consummation of this work is to make man God in life and nature, with no share in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE ABOVE SIX STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ARE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE JOINING OF</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT" AS "ONE SPIRIT"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The above six steps are accomplished by the joining of "the Spirit with our spirit" Rom 8:16 as "one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this were not so, even though the gospel of God is "powerful" Rom 1:16 , it still would not have any power or accomplish anything in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only through the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in these six steps can the transforming work of making man God be fully accomplished.</S>
