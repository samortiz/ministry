   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 19, 1948, 6:30 a.m.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee THE SOLID CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We believe that many of the critical issues in consecration have to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first factor has to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consecration is not simply us handing ourselves over to the Lord, but us handing ourselves over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A consecration that does not result in handing ourself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch our money and occupation is not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>MONEY The Relationship between God,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All Things, and Money</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How does God see money?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first is the relationship between God and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second is the relationship between all things and money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God made from one all things Acts 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan is God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet he cannot deal with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</S>
