   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO ONCE FAR OFF, BUT NOW NEAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 2:1-3 gives us a picture of our condition by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we need to see that verses 11 and 12 portray our position according to our status.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of our sinful nature, we were in a condition of death; according to our status, we were far off from God, Christ, God s kingdom, God s blessings, God s promise, and everything related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE NATIONS IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first point concerning our status is that we were the nations in the flesh v. 11 . The Greek word translated nations also means Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, according to our status, we were the Gentiles in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The man God created to fulfill His purpose was pure, without sin or any kind of negative mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into man through the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the evil nature of Satan entered into man, it firstly caused man s body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually caused the whole being of man to become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a very real sense, God created only the body of man, not the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when sin came into man s body, the body was changed in nature and became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The body was the pure vessel created by God; the flesh is the corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God did not create the lusts in man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The lusts came from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible, eventually fallen man in his entirety became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fallen people live according to the flesh, not according to the spirit, the conscience, or reason.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because in the eyes of God fallen man has become flesh, the Bible says, By the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word flesh in this verse denotes a fallen person who lives according to the flesh and has become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because his whole being had become the flesh, man was damaged and thus prevented from fulfilling God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since mankind as a whole could not fulfill His purpose, God came in to call out of fallen mankind a race Abraham and his descendants for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God then commanded Abraham and his descendants to be circumcised, that is, to put away the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, circumcision indicates that God s chosen people must put aside their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fact that the called race was circumcised meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are called the circumcision, those who are separated from the fallen situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rest of mankind are called the uncircumcision, those who remain in the fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Abraham and his descendants, the called race, were circumcised, those who remained in the fallen estate became the nations in the flesh, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were in this category before we were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>UNCIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11 says that the nations in the flesh were called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words uncircumcision and circumcision in this verse both apply to people; they do not refer to actions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The circumcision are those who are circumcised, and the uncircumcision are those who are not circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>APART FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 12 says that we were at that time apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ, in whom all God s blessings to His chosen people are embodied, came out of Israel, the circumcised people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were separated from Israel, we were apart from Christ, having nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>ALIENATED FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 12 also says that we were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The commonwealth here refers to the citizenship, the civil rights, of God s chosen people, including God s ruling, blessing, and presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the fall, mankind lost all the rights which God intended for man in his creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By calling Abraham, God brought His chosen people back to all these rights through circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we, as uncircumcised Gentiles, still remained alienated from them.</S>
