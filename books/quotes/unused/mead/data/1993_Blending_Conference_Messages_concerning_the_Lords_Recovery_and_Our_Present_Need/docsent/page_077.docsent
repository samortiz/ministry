   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE SEVEN THE VITAL GROUPS OUTLINE The vital groups cannot be formed by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A vital group could come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a desperate saint would spontaneously contact others by the Lord's leading and gain some companion or companions for him to have a vital group.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They should definitely and absolutely fulfill the first four basic requirements: Intimate and thorough fellowship that they may be blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thorough confession of sins, transgressions, defects, wrongdoings, etc. Thorough consecration of themselves and of all that they have and do to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Praying unceasingly that they may be brought into the infilling and the outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should pick up the burden and take the action to contact others, either sinners or Christians: Always taking care of two or three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not expecting to have a quick result, but setting a definite goal with a strong determination to gain at least one remaining fruit yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With inexhaustible patience and unceasing intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They should have their group members meeting together once a week to fellowship about and study every case of their candidates to find out the best way to take care of each candidate and the best helper or helpers to catch the candidate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a candidate is gained and baptized, they should try their best to bring him or her to their group meeting and help him or her to participate in the fellowship of the group meeting and learn how to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should instruct and guide the newly baptized ones to gain others and to prophesy in the church meetings.</S>
