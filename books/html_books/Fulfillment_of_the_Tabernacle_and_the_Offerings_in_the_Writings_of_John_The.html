In giving these messages I take it for granted that you have read through all the messages in the Life-study of John. If you have not read those messages, I would encourage you to read them. Otherwise, certain matters that we shall cover in this series of messages may be puzzling to you.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>These messages also assume some knowledge of the book of Exodus. Do you know what was the goal of the exodus of God&#8217;s people from Egypt? The goal was that the Lord would have a dwelling place on earth with a serving priesthood. Actually, the dwelling place and the priesthood are one. First Peter 2:5 says that we are &#8220;being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood.&#8221; This verse indicates that the spiritual house and the priesthood are one. Therefore, the priesthood is the building, and the building is the priesthood. In the typology in the book of Exodus we have two matters-the tabernacle and the priesthood. But in the New Testament fulfillment of these types, the building and the priesthood are one. The building is God&#8217;s spiritual house, and it is also a group of priests, a body of serving ones. Today, on the one hand, we are God&#8217;s dwelling place; on the other hand, we are a priesthood serving God. It is God&#8217;s goal to have this dwelling place, this priesthood. If we understand this, we shall be prepared to see the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings in the writings of John.<h2 class=head1>EXTRACTS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>As we proceed chapter by chapter through the Gospel of John, our concern will be with what we may call the extract of each chapter. We shall not study the chapters verse by verse. What is the extract of chapter one of John? An extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is &#8220;spirit,&#8221; which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form, especially by distillation. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance. It is not our purpose in these messages to repeat the Life-study of the Gospel of John. Our purpose is to see what is the extract, the spirit, of each chapter. In this message we shall consider the extract of John chapter one.<p>Many teachers and expositors say that the first eighteen verses of John 1 are a prologue, an introduction, to the entire Gospel. This understanding is correct. However, after further study of this Gospel, we have come to realize that all of chapter one is an introduction or prologue to the Gospel of John. Often the introduction to a book is actually an extract of the book, for it usually gives the reader a brief outline of the book as a whole. Such an outline is the extract of the book. In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have an extract of the substance of the following twenty chapters.<p>The extract of John 1 includes six matters: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, the stone, and the house of God. John 1:51 says, &#8220;And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&#8221; This refers to Jacob&#8217;s dream of a ladder with angels ascending and descending on it. Jacob called the name of the place where he had that dream Bethel, which means the house of God. In the first chapter of John, we see the Word (1:1), the tabernacle (1:14), the Lamb of God (1:29), the dove, which is a symbol of the Spirit (1:32), the stone (1:42), and the building, the house of God, Bethel (1:51). The first of these six items, the Word, is found in verse 1, and the last, the house of God, Bethel, in verse 51. In between we have the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, and the stone. In verse 51 we see the ladder that joins heaven to earth, and earth to heaven. This is the house of God, Bethel. These six matters are the extract of John 1.<p>You may have read this chapter through many times without seeing this extract. If some were asked what chapter one of John talks about, they may say, according to their experience, that this chapter tells us that all those who have received Christ have been given the authority to become children of God, those who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (vv. 12-13). This, of course, is a wonderful matter. Others may say that John 1 reveals that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God. However, not many readers of the Gospel of John have seen as a whole the six matters of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the dove, the stone, and the house. We need to be deeply impressed that the extract of John 1 includes these six matters.<h2 class=head1>GOD AND THE WORD</h2><p>John 1:1 and 2 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&#8221; By itself verse 1 does not indicate definitely that the Word was with God from the beginning. If we only had this verse, some might think that the Word was in the beginning, but doubt that the Word was with God from the beginning. They may think that the Word was with God only after a certain time. This concept concerning the Word was the source of a serious heresy in John&#8217;s time. Certain heretics taught that the Logos, the Word, was not eternal. These heretics claimed that the Word was made by God and that the Word was not self-existing. In order to refute this heresy, John added verse 2: &#8220;He was in the beginning with God.&#8221; In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God.<p>It is not the case, as supposed by some, that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God. Christ&#8217;s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God, and He is God.<p>John&#8217;s concept is that the Logos, the Word (no doubt, this refers to the Lord Jesus), was not made, was not created. On the contrary, the Word is self-existing, without beginning or ending, because He is God. Therefore, in these two verses we have a strong argument against heretical teachings concerning the Person of Christ and a strong inoculation against such heresies.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERIES IN JOHN&#8217;S WRITINGS</h2><p>All of John&#8217;s writings are concerned with mysteries. His Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation are full of mysteries. The first three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are called synoptic Gospels. The word synoptic means having the same point of view. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all share the same point of view. If you read through these three Gospels, you will see that the narratives in them are very much the same. But after these three Gospels comes another Gospel with another point of view. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all speak of the Lord Jesus as a Man. In Matthew we see that the Lord Jesus is the King; in Mark, that He is a servant; and in Luke, that He is a Man. Since a king and a servant are men, all three of these Gospels speak of Christ in His humanity, one as the King, one as the Servant of God, and one as the proper Man. But the Gospel of John is concerned with Christ in His divinity.<p>The humanity of Christ is not a mystery. However, the divinity of Christ surely is a mystery. With respect to His humanity, Jesus of Nazareth was not mysterious. Like all human beings, He had to sleep, eat, and drink. He even wept as others do. But within Him there was the divine nature. This is a mystery.<p>People knew the Lord Jesus in His humanity. They could say that they knew His brothers and sisters and His mother, that He was the son of a carpenter. Regarding all this, it seemed that there was nothing mysterious. But the divinity within the Lord Jesus was a great mystery. Sometimes even His disciples wondered who He was. For example, after He had rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm, the disciples marveled and said, &#8220;What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&#8221; (Matt. 8:27).<p>In His deity, Christ is God, the eternal Logos, the self-existing One, the One without beginning. The name of Jesus refers to the Lord after His incarnation. Therefore, we cannot say, &#8220;In the beginning was Jesus.&#8221; It was the Logos, not Jesus, who was with God in the beginning. Jesus was born as a man according to the record in chapter two of Luke. He was then taken to Egypt and eventually lived in Nazareth. But as we have pointed out, within this Jesus there was a great mystery, the mystery of His divinity. It truly is a mystery that the man Jesus is God. The Gospel of John is concerned with the mystery of the Lord&#8217;s divine Person.<p>Christ is mysterious not only in His deity, but also in His divine work. Therefore, the Gospel of John speaks of the mysteries of Christ&#8217;s Person and work. Concerning the mystery of Christ&#8217;s divine work, John 19:34 says, &#8220;But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.&#8221; Here we see that two substances came out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, dealing with sin (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, dealing with death (John 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (John 12:24; Eph. 5:29-31). The Lord&#8217;s death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins, and, on the positive side, to impart life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the three other Gospels is only for the redemptive aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death, but John&#8217;s record is not only for the redemptive aspect, but also for the life-imparting aspect. In Matthew 27:45, 51; Mark 15:33; and Luke 23:44-45, darkness, a symbol of sin, appeared, and the veil of the temple which separated man from God was rent. Those are signs regarding the Lord&#8217;s redemptive death. The Lord&#8217;s redemptive death is also depicted by the words spoken by the Lord on the cross in Luke 23:34, &#8220;Father, forgive them,&#8221; and in Matthew 27:46, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; (because He bore our sin at that time). But the flowing water in John 19:34 is a sign regarding the Lord&#8217;s life-imparting death. This death that imparts life releases the Lord&#8217;s divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, composed of all His believers into whom His divine life is imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat falling into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains (John 12:24). Hence, it is also the life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death.<p>If we do not see the mystery of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, we shall not know the significance of the blood and water flowing out from His side. The flowing of the blood and water is mysterious. Blood is for redeeming, but water is for life-imparting. This is mysterious because life-imparting is a mysterious matter. As we have pointed out, the Lord&#8217;s death on the cross was likened to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die in order to bring forth many grains. This aspect of Christ&#8217;s death is also a mystery.<p>Another mysterious aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death is referred to in John 3:14 and 15: &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.&#8221; This is the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses (Num. 21:4-9). When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents. God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God&#8217;s judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all might live. That was the type. In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself. As the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole, the Lord was lifted up on the cross to deal with Satan, the old serpent. This is certainly a mystery.<p>Of course, the incarnation is a great mystery. Christ&#8217;s deity is a mystery, and His becoming flesh is also a mystery. How could the very God become flesh? This is mysterious.<p>All the Gospels record miracles done by the Lord Jesus. But in Matthew, Mark, and Luke they are called miracles. However, the miracles in the Gospel of John are not called miracles; the Greek word is signs. For example, in Cana of Galilee the Lord changed water into wine. This was a miracle. But John 2:11 says, &#8220;This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.&#8221; A sign signifies something invisible. It is a symbol that points to a mystery. All the miracles in the Gospel of John, being signs, signify certain invisible mysteries. Every sign in this Gospel is a symbol of a mystery. Therefore, the Gospel of John is a book of mysteries.<p>As a book of mysteries, the Gospel of John is the story of God. It is not merely the story of a man named Jesus. It was the very God who lived in this Man who performed these miracles, these signs. Therefore, we may say that the Gospel of John is the story of God in the Man Jesus. This God does many signs. Whatever He does is a mystery. We may know all the miracles recorded in this Gospel, but we may not have seen that these all are signs of mysteries. I point this out because we need to realize that the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is altogether a mysterious matter.<p>We have seen that the Gospel of John, along with his Epistles and Revelation, is a book of mysteries. This Gospel speaks of the mystery of Christ&#8217;s divine Person and work. John 1:14 says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; Here we see three mysteries. The Word is a mystery, the flesh is a mystery, and even the tabernacle is a mystery. The Word, the Logos, is a mystery to us. In eternity Christ was the Logos, and in time this Logos became flesh. According to John 1:14, this flesh is a tabernacle. All this is a mystery that is beyond our ability to comprehend fully.<p>Sometimes we say, according to the Bible, that we are the dwelling place of God. This means that we are God&#8217;s sanctuary. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we would never refer to our meeting hall as a sanctuary. But we definitely have a sanctuary in the church life, for we, the believers in Christ, are God&#8217;s sanctuary. No, we do not have a so-called sanctuary built of wood, steel, and stone. Instead, we have a sanctuary built of the living members of Christ. Unbelievers are not able to understand this. If we tell them that we, the living members of Christ, are God&#8217;s sanctuary, they would say, &#8220;What are you talking about? I don&#8217;t understand how you people can be a sanctuary.&#8221; The reason unbelievers cannot understand how we can be God&#8217;s sanctuary is that this is a mystery.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB</h2><p>Let us go on from the mysteries of the Word and the tabernacle to the Lamb of God. According to John 1:29, John the Baptist said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; John, of course, did not see a lamb; he saw the Man Jesus walking. But he declared that this One is the Lamb of God. This also is a mystery.<p>In John 1:1 we first have God and the Logos, the Word. Then in John 1:14 we have the tabernacle. In the Life-study of Exodus we studied the tabernacle in great detail. The tabernacle in Exodus is a type of God&#8217;s dwelling place. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and this Word, which is God, became flesh. This flesh is the tabernacle. Hallelujah, we have God! We have the tabernacle!<p>Once we have the tabernacle, the next crucial matter is to behold the Lamb of God. The Lamb of God represents all the offerings, for this Lamb is the leading offering. Therefore, in John 1 we have God, we have God&#8217;s dwelling place, the tabernacle, and we have all the offerings.<p>The tabernacle signifies that it is possible to enter into God, or we may say that God is enterable. This is clearly indicated by the fact that the tabernacle, which signifies God incarnate, has an entrance. Therefore, the tabernacle with its entrance indicates that God Himself is enterable. But how can we enter into God as the tabernacle? According to the typology in the Old Testament, we enter the tabernacle by means of the offerings. In the Old Testament the offerings were the means by which the children of Israel could enter the tabernacle. Without the offerings, no one was allowed to come into the tabernacle. This indicates that apart from the offerings required by God, no one can enter into Him. This is the reason that after the tabernacle in John 1:14 we have the Lamb of God in 1:29 as the unique representative of all the offerings.<p>John 1:29 says that the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. This means that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away sin from the human race. The phrase &#8220;from the world&#8221; in this verse actually means from mankind. Through Satan sin has entered into man. Satan injected sin, his poisonous nature, into the human race. But the Lamb of God has come to take away this sin from the world, from mankind. Therefore, through this unique offering it is possible for fallen human beings to enter into God.<h2 class=head1>THE DOVE, A SYMBOL OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Following the Lamb, we have the dove, which symbolizes the Spirit. First, the Word, the Logos, becomes the tabernacle. Then the very One who is the tabernacle is also the offerings represented by the Lamb. Now we must go on to see that the One who is the tabernacle and the offerings has become the life-giving Spirit signified by the dove. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; This life-giving Spirit is the dove in John 1:32.<p>In the Life-study of Exodus we have seen that after the tabernacle and the offerings we have the ointment. The ointment in Exodus 30 typifies the life-giving Spirit. Hence, both the ointment and the dove symbolize the Spirit.<p>It is important to understand why the ointment is recorded after the tabernacle and the offerings and why the dove is mentioned after the tabernacle and the Lamb. The reason for this sequence is that first we need the incarnation, the crucifixion, and the resurrection. It was through resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is symbolized by the dove and by the anointing oil. This should help us to understand why the dove, a sign of the Spirit, must come after the tabernacle and the Lamb, the unique offering.<p>The symbols in the Bible are very meaningful. This is true in particular of the Lamb and the dove in John 1. A lamb is something on earth, and a dove soars in the heavens. Christ as the Lamb was a man walking on earth. But when He became the life-giving Spirit, He became the Spirit in the heavens signified by the dove.<p>Thus far in John 1 we have seen four aspects of one wonderful Person. In eternity past Christ was the Logos, the Word. Then in time He became the tabernacle and also the offerings. After becoming all the offerings, He became the life-giving Spirit, the dove from heaven. I am pointing out the mysteries of the Logos, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove in John chapter one. These are not ordinary words; they are signs. The Logos, the Word, is a sign. Likewise, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove all are signs.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB, AND THE DOVE</h2><p>As a sign, what does the Word, the Logos, signify? The Logos signifies God explained, defined, and expressed. The Logos, therefore, is a sign giving us a full picture of God.<p>As a sign, what does the tabernacle signify? The tabernacle signifies that the eternal God, after taking the step of incarnation, became one with man, who is in the flesh, and through a process of mingling became His own dwelling place. This is the significance of the tabernacle as a sign. The tabernacle signifies that through incarnation God became a man, mingled Himself with humanity, and became His own dwelling place. How mysterious this is! Because of matters like this in the Gospel of John, it is not easy to understand it.<p>Now we need to go on to ask what the Lamb signifies. The Lamb signifies that the incarnate God who has become His own dwelling place has also become all the offerings to take away sin from the world so that God&#8217;s chosen people may enter into Him.<p>What is the significance of the dove? The dove signifies that the One who became the tabernacle and who is all the offerings has become a life-giving Spirit to impart God into all those who accept the offerings in order to enter into God. This means that the life-giving Spirit imparts the divine Person, the divine Being, into the believers to be their life. How wonderful! Praise the Lord for the significance of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove!<h2 class=head1>THE STONE AND THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>What is the issue of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove? The issue, the result, is the stone. This is the reason the Lord Jesus looked at Simon Peter and said, &#8220;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).&#8221; Everyone who takes the offerings and enters into God, having the divine life imparted into him, eventually becomes a stone. First the life-giving Spirit regenerates the believers and imparts the divine life into them. Then He gradually transforms them one by one from clay into stone. In God&#8217;s creation we all are clay. But in God&#8217;s new creation we, the believers in Christ, will be transformed into stones for the building up of God&#8217;s dwelling place, Bethel. Therefore, the final issue of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the dove, and the stone is the house of God.<p>When the eternal God became flesh, He became the tabernacle. At the same time, He became the offerings to take care of the problem of sin. He has also become the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into His believers to be their life. As a result, the believers are regenerated and gradually transformed into stones for the building up of the house of God.<p>In chapter one of John we see the tabernacle toward the beginning and the house of God at the very end. In between the tabernacle and the house of God, we have the redeeming Lamb to accomplish redemption through the offerings, and the life-giving Spirit to impart life into the believers to regenerate them and transform them into stones. Then these stones will be built up into the house of God.<p>Is this not the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings? Certainly here in the writings of John we have the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament. All these matters are very mysterious. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, these mysteries, conveyed in the signs of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the dove, the stone, and the house of God, have become clear and visible to us.<h2 class=head1>THE INCARNATION OF THE DEFINED GOD</h2><p>I hope that after reading this message you will be able to tell others how the tabernacle and the offerings have their fulfillment in the Gospel of John. Regarding this matter, we should not speak according to our imagination or natural intelligence. We should speak according to what is revealed in the Gospel of John. In John chapter one we first have God defined, explained, and expressed by the Word. The Word is the definition of God. Hence, the Word is the defined God. This defined God, the Logos, became the tabernacle. This means that the type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament was fulfilled by the defined God coming to mingle Himself with man in the flesh. Let us be impressed that the defined God becoming incarnate to mingle Himself with humanity is the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle. In simple words, we may say that the tabernacle has been fulfilled by the defined God in His incarnation.<p>A number of songs and hymns have been written on the birth of Christ. One well-known hymn, written by Charles Wesley, opens with the words, &#8220;Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King.&#8221; Like so many others, this hymn is a praise concerning the birth of Jesus mainly according to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. But where can you find a hymn that is a praise concerning Christ&#8217;s incarnation and birth written according to the revelation in the Gospel of John? It is easier to write hymns according to what is written in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, because these Gospels are not so mysterious. But because the incarnation of the defined God as presented in John is very mysterious, it is difficult to write a hymn on this subject. Nevertheless, I would encourage some of the saints to try to compose a hymn on the incarnation of the defined God.<p>In traditional Christian teachings the matter of the incarnation of the defined God to become the tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place, has been neglected. The reason for this neglect is that a matter such as this is mysterious. How we thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has revealed this mystery to us!<h2 class=head1>A DOVE ON A LAMB</h2><p>Today we have the reality of the tabernacle and the reality of all the offerings by means of which we may enter into the incarnated God. Many Christians have not seen how this dear One, the One who became the tabernacle and who is all the offerings, has also become the dove, the life-giving Spirit. But in John 1 we see a dove on a Lamb, the heavenly dove upon a Lamb on earth. This Lamb of God is all the offerings. This dove is the life-giving Spirit who has regenerated us, who is now transforming us into stones, and who is also building us up into the house of God. This house is the Bethel that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. This is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Chapter one of John is the introduction to the entire Gospel of John. The remaining twenty chapters are filled with details showing how this One is the tabernacle and how He is the sin offering, the trespass offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and, eventually, the peace offering. In particular, in chapter fourteen we see how this One becomes the life-giving Spirit. First, as the Lamb of God, Christ is all the offerings. Then according to what is revealed in chapter fourteen, through death and resurrection He becomes the life-giving Spirit.<p>In John 14:16 and 17 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; The very He who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very I who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This means that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality. First Corinthians 15:45 confirms this. In dealing with the matter of resurrection, this verse says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221;<p>Therefore, when the Spirit of reality comes to be in us, the Lord Himself comes to dwell in us, for He has become the life-giving Spirit. Now, through the life-imparting and transforming work of the Spirit, all those who believe in Christ can be transformed from Simons to Peters and thereby become stones to be built up into the house of God, God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth.<p>As we will consider the following twenty chapters in the Gospel of John, we shall see the details concerning the six items that form the extract of chapter one: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, the stone, and the house of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER Two</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE,  AND THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51</h1><p>In the following two messages we shall consider in some detail the extract of chapter one of John as seen in the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. We shall consider in particular the significance of these six signs. In this message we shall give a preliminary word regarding the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. Our focus here will be on the meaning of the Word in John 1:1.<p>From the time I began to study the Bible as a youth, I have been trying to find out the definition of the Word in John 1:1. Although I have read some excellent books on this matter, nothing I have read concerning this has been fully satisfying to me. Some expositors and Bible teachers say that the Word in John 1:1 refers to the concept of the Logos in Greek philosophy. According to these writings, the Logos was a basic element or substance in Greek philosophical thinking. One book I read recently says that the Logos involves the inner conception plus the outward expression. According to this understanding of the Word, the Logos, first there is the inner conception. When this conception is uttered, there is the outward expression. Therefore, according to this interpretation, the inner conception plus the outward expression equals the Word, the Logos.<p>This definition of the Word in John 1:1 is not adequate. Deep within me there is still the desire to know what this term means in the divine revelation, in the Bible. Therefore, I have been exercising my inner being and looking to the Lord that He would give us the proper understanding of the Word in John 1:1.<h2 class=head1>INTERPRETING THE BIBLE BY THE BIBLE</h2><p>When I was young, I was taught some basic things that have been helpful through the years in my study of the Bible. One of these basic matters is that we should interpret the Bible by the Bible. According to this principle, a particular verse in the holy Word requires the rest of the Bible to define it. This means that the entire Bible is the full, whole, complete, and perfect definition of any word or term used in the Bible. For more than fifty years, I have been keeping this principle in my reading and study of the Word of God. I cannot deny that I have been helped by consulting reference books and expositions. Nevertheless, even after receiving help from such books, there is still the hunger and the thirst to know the real significance, the proper connotation, of the different terms in the Bible. Therefore, after studying the writings of others, I have always had to come back to the principle of interpreting any verse in the Bible by the entire Bible itself.<h2 class=head1>THE LIVING WORD AND THE WRITTEN WORD</h2><p>Recently I began to receive light from the Lord according to His entire divine revelation concerning the real significance of the Word in John 1:1. Many years ago I learned that Christ is the living Word and that the Bible is the written Word. Actually, these are not two words. The living Word and the written Word are one and correspond to each other. Although I knew this, I did not apply this understanding to the Word in John 1:1. Now I see that the Word in John 1:1 involves the written Word with the living Word as its reality.<p>In order to have the proper understanding of the Word in John 1:1, we need to come to the Bible and see what the Word refers to in the holy Scriptures. If we do this we shall see that first it refers to Christ as the living Word. This living Word needs a written Word. Without the written Word, we are not able to apprehend the living Word. We need a book, the Bible, to define and explain the living Person of Christ. Christ, the universal Person, is the living Word of God, and the Bible is the written Word. The Bible is the Book of books, and Christ is the Person. The Book is the definition of the Person. The written Word, the Bible, is the definition of the living Word, the living Person of Christ. This is the living Word with the written Word.<h2 class=head1>THE DEFINED GOD</h2><p>When we have the living Word with the written Word, we have the defined God. Because God is abstract, mysterious, and invisible, there is the need for God to be the Word in order to explain Himself, define Himself, reveal Himself. The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained God, the expressed God, the revealed God, the God made known to human beings. This is the Word. The Word in John 1:1 refers to our Lord, the living Word, with the Bible, the written Word.<p>In Revelation 19:11-13 we have a picture of Christ judging and making war. Verse 13 says, &#8220;And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God.&#8221; The name on the Lord&#8217;s thigh may be likened to a badge, label, or sign. As He fights against the enemy, He wears a sign saying &#8220;The Word of God.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord Himself is the Word of God. Do you want to know God? In order to know God, you need to read Christ, study Christ, behold Christ, contemplate Christ, gaze on Christ.<p>However, we cannot know the Lord, the living Word, simply by studying Him or contemplating Him. We also need the Book, the Bible, the written Word. If we would know God, on the one hand we need to contemplate this living Person and, on the other hand, we need to study the Book.<p>We have seen that the Word in John 1:1 refers both to the living Word and the written Word. The Word in this verse is great! This Word is actually God Himself.<p>Throughout the centuries there has been much debate among theologians concerning John 1:1. We have pointed out that, according to John 1:1, Christ is God. Others claim that the last part of this verse should not be translated, &#8220;and the Word was God,&#8221; but should be rendered, &#8220;and the Word was deity.&#8221; Some who prefer this translation deny that Jesus Christ is the very God Himself. They may say that He is deity, but not that He is God. They may hold the concept that the Lord Jesus is the Logos and is deity, but deny that He is God Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD DEFINED IN A LIVING PERSON</h2><p>The Word in John 1:1 is the Triune God defined in a living Person. That living Person is not only the Son of God-He is the entire God. Speaking of Christ, Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; It is difficult to define the word &#8220;fullness&#8221; as it is used in the Bible. Can you explain the difference between fullness and riches? Some who are familiar with what we have written elsewhere may say that the riches are what Christ is and the fullness is what we become as Christ&#8217;s Body as a result of enjoying Christ. However, this explanation is not so helpful here. According to biblical usage, the significance of the word &#8220;fullness&#8221; surpasses that of the word &#8220;riches.&#8221; Fullness is more formal. First we have the riches and then the fullness. We may say, therefore, that fullness surpasses riches. Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. This fullness does not dwell in Christ theoretically or invisibly; it dwells in Him bodily.<p>What does the expression &#8220;the fullness of the Godhead&#8221; refer to? Does it not refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete Person of God? Yes, the fullness of the Godhead is the entire Godhead, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. How, then, could we say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit? This would not be logical. Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God, but, the entire God.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD BECOMING FLESH AND TABERNACLING AMONG US</h2><p>John 1:1 and 2 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&#8221; In the beginning, that is, in eternity past, the Word that defined God, explained God, and revealed God, was with God. He was with God before the foundation of the world. Then one day He became a man. In John 1:14, the Word became flesh. The translation &#8220;was made&#8221; in the King James Version is not correct. The proper rendering of the Greek word is &#8220;became.&#8221; The Greek word here indicates a strong step related to having a new beginning. In eternity Christ, the living Word, was God without humanity. But through incarnation He took a strong step to have a new beginning. He became a man.<p>John 1:14 says that the Word not only became flesh but also tabernacled among us. In this verse there are two predicates: became and tabernacled. The story recorded in the four Gospels is a story of God incarnate tabernacling among us. The word &#8220;tabernacling&#8221; covers the four Gospels.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST CRUCIFIED AS THE LAMB OF GOD</h2><p>Toward the end of the record in the Gospels, the Lord Jesus went to the cross to die for our redemption. He died as the Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36). Therefore, in the four Gospels we see Christ as the tabernacle, and at the end of the Gospels we see Him crucified as the Lamb of God.<h2 class=head1>THE HEAVENLY DOVE</h2><p>After accomplishing redemption as the Lamb, Christ was resurrected and came as the Dove, as the life-giving Spirit. The Dove is actually Christ Himself in another form. First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This verse points to another new beginning, also indicated by the word &#8220;became.&#8221; When the Word became flesh, that was a new beginning. When in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, that was another new beginning. Now Christ is with us as the Dove. In John 20 and 21 we see Him as the Dove.<h2 class=head1>THE DOVE-LAMB</h2><p>In Acts and in the Epistles we have the record of the heavenly Dove, the Dove out of heaven. As the Lamb Christ walked upon the earth, but as the Dove He soars in the air. This soaring Dove descends upon us. When we lay our hand upon the Lamb, the Dove descends upon us. Now what we have is not the Lamb and the Dove, but the Lamb with the Dove. The Dove does not stand beside the Lamb. Rather, the Dove rests upon the Lamb. The Dove descends upon the Lamb and abides upon the Lamb. Therefore, the Dove and the Lamb are one. This Dove-Lamb is a single entity with two parts, the Lamb, the first part, and the Dove, the second part. As the Lamb He is the Redeemer; as the Dove He is the life-giver.<h2 class=head1>LIVING STONES FOR A SPIRITUAL HOUSE</h2><p>In the Epistles we see the transforming work of the Dove to make us stones. In the Epistles many stones are produced. The issue of these stones is the building up of a spiritual house. As Peter says, we are living stones being built up a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). This spiritual house will consummate in the New Jerusalem.<p>In this message we have seen a sketch of the whole New Testament. First we have the Word, the living Word with the written Word. Then we have the tabernacling of the incarnated Word among us. This tabernacling of the Word is described in detail in the four Gospels. At the end of the Gospels we see that the Lamb was crucified for our redemption. In resurrection the Lamb became the Dove. In the book of Acts and in the Epistles, we see Christ as the Dove. Furthermore, in the Epistles we see that the believers are transformed into stones and that all these stones are being built up together to be a spiritual house which consummates in the new Jerusalem. This is God&#8217;s economy. This is the central lane of God&#8217;s operation revealed in the Bible.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE, AND THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51</h1><p>In this message we shall cover a number of basic matters regarding John&#8217;s writings, the Gospel of John in particular. We shall also speak further on the six matters that form the extract of chapter one, which is a prologue of the entire book: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God.<h2 class=head1>I. JOHN&#8217;S WRITINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Not Only Supplementary but Also Consummating</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, teachers and expositors have agreed that John&#8217;s writings were the last of the New Testament writings to be completed. All of the Epistles of Paul and Peter were completed approximately A.D. 65. It was about a quarter of a century later, that is, approximately A.D. 90, that John composed three categories of writings: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation. The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation were the last books of the Bible to be written.<p>John&#8217;s writings are not only supplementary but also consummating. The Gospel of John consummates the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John&#8217;s Epistles consummate all the other Epistles, and John&#8217;s Revelation consummates the entire New Testament, even the entire Bible. John&#8217;s writings, therefore, are both supplementary and consummating.<h2 class=head2>1. Supplementary to the Synoptic Gospels with the View of Christ&#8217;s Deity</h2><p>The Gospel of John supplements the synoptic Gospels with the view of Christ&#8217;s deity. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called synoptic Gospels. The word synoptic means having one point of view. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written from the point of view of Christ&#8217;s humanity. Matthew reveals that Christ is the King; Mark, that He is the Servant of God; and Luke, that He is our Savior. The King, the Servant, and the Savior are all aspects of Christ in His humanity. But the Lord Jesus is God as well as man, divine as well as human. Therefore, there is the need of a supplement to the synoptic Gospels showing Christ&#8217;s deity. The Gospel of John is both supplementary and consummating, for it unveils the divine side of the wonderful Person of Christ. In John&#8217;s writings we have a view of Christ&#8217;s deity.<h2 class=head2>2. Consummating the Divine Revelation with the Divine Person, the Divine Life, the Divine Nature, and the Divine Accomplishments of the Triune God</h2><p>The writings of John consummate the divine revelation with the divine Person, the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine accomplishments of the Triune God. In John&#8217;s Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation we can see how much the divine Father has accomplished. Whatever He has accomplished is divine. In John&#8217;s writings we also see how much has been accomplished by the Son and the Holy Spirit. Whatever is accomplished by the Triune God is divine and mysterious.<h2 class=head2>B. Not Only Polemical but Also Unveiling</h2><p>Some theologians say that John&#8217;s writings are polemical or argumentative. The word &#8220;polemical&#8221; is derived from the Greek word for war and denotes a controversial argument, in particular an argument against some opinion or doctrine. John&#8217;s writings are polemical in that he was fighting against the heresies regarding Christ&#8217;s Person. However, his writings are not only polemical but also unveiling. They unveil the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God. In the writings of John one veil after another is taken away. The book of Revelation is a book of unveiling. (In Greek, the word &#8220;revelation&#8221; means unveiling.) Even now, God&#8217;s administration is being carried out in the universe. Unbelievers do not see God&#8217;s administration and do not have any knowledge of it. But because the veil has been taken away, we can see that Christ is on the throne in the heavens carrying out God&#8217;s administration. This is one of the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God. John&#8217;s writings are not merely polemical or argumentative, but even the more, they are unveiling.<h2 class=head2>C. Not Only Conciliatory but Also All-inclusive</h2><p>John&#8217;s writings are not only conciliatory but also all-inclusive. The word conciliatory means reconciling. Some theologians say that John&#8217;s writings are conciliatory in reconciling doctrinal controversies concerning Christ&#8217;s Person. One school of thought claimed that Christ was divine but not human. Of course, this is heretical. According to 1 John 4, some spirits do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is to deny the fact that Christ is human as well as divine. Another school of thought claimed that Christ was human and not divine, that He was merely a good man but not God. According to this heretical school, after His resurrection Christ became divine. John reconciled these matters when he said that the Word is God and that the Word became flesh (John 1:1, 14). The Word is divine, even God Himself. The &#8220;flesh&#8221; in John 1:14 denotes humanity. Therefore, in these verses John shows that Christ is both God and man, both divine and human.<p>We would prefer to say that John&#8217;s writings are not merely conciliatory but all-inclusive. The writings of John are all-inclusive in the truth of Christ being all in all. Those who do not see Christ&#8217;s all-inclusiveness can be compared to blind men touching different parts of an elephant. Some touch the trunk, and others touch the legs, the side, or the tail. But all think that they have a full understanding of what an elephant is. Instead of trying to reconcile the differences among these blind men, John would speak concerning the entire elephant. It is a kind of blindness to deny any aspect of Christ&#8217;s all-inclusiveness.<p>Christ is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature. Years ago, certain ones declared, &#8220;Our Christ is the Creator, but He is not a creature.&#8221; When I heard this, I said to myself, &#8220;It is foolish to say that Christ is not a creature, but that He is only the Creator. If Christ were not a creature as well as the Creator, how could He be a man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones? Are these not the elements of a creature?&#8221; Because of the heretical teaching of Arius, who was condemned at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, some are not willing to say that Christ is a creature as well as the Creator. (Arius falsely taught that Christ was merely a created being, not the very God Himself.) According to the Bible, our Christ is all-inclusive. Because He is God, He is the Creator. But because He is also a man, He is a creature with a body made up of created elements.<p>If Christ were not a creature, how could He have had the blood to shed for our sins? The divine Being does not have the blood required for our redemption. Because we are human beings, we need human blood to be shed for us. The redemption accomplished through the blood of Jesus gives us eternal salvation. This blood has eternal efficacy. First John 1:7 speaks of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God. The name Jesus denotes the Lord&#8217;s humanity; the title Son of God denotes His divinity. It is the blood of Jesus that redeems us, and it is the divinity of the Son of God that insures the eternal efficacy of this redeeming blood. If Christ were only divine, He would not have had the blood to shed for us. But because He is both human and divine, both a creature and the Creator, He had the blood to shed for our redemption.<p>John&#8217;s writings reveal the truth of Christ being all in all. Christ is God, man, the Creator, the creature, and even our spiritual food, water, and air. Because we teach the all-inclusiveness of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, others have falsely accused us of teaching pantheism, the heretical doctrine that everything in the universe is God. Those who condemn us falsely for teaching pantheism say, &#8220;Witness Lee teaches that grass, water, air, sunshine, and wind are all God. He claims that everything in creation is divine. Therefore, he is pantheistic in his teaching. We know that he came from the Orient, and that oriental people are pantheistic.&#8221; This is their accusation, but I strongly declare that I am not pantheistic. According to the Scriptures, I teach that Christ is all-inclusive. My Christ is God and man, the Creator and a creature. Christ is my Redeemer, my Savior, my Master, my Lord, and the life-giving Spirit. He is the real life, light, spiritual food, water, and air. Christ is even my spiritual clothing. Oh, He is everything to me! Is this pantheism? Certainly not! This is the truth of Christ&#8217;s all-inclusiveness revealed in the writings of the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>D. Books of Mysteries</h2><p>John&#8217;s writings are books of mysteries because his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation all speak of divine things, and divine things are mysterious. Everything related to divinity is a mystery. God Himself is mysterious. It is extremely important that we see the mysteries in this universe. If we do not see these mysteries, we are blind. All the mysteries are related to divinity. In the Gospel of John, in particular, we see the mysteries of the divine Person and the divine work of Christ.<p>In the Epistles of John we see the mysteries of the divine life within the believers. The mystery of the divine life includes the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed. As those who have received the divine life, we participate in the fellowship of the divine life. This fellowship is a mystery. We also have within us the divine anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed. All these matters are mysterious.<p>In the book of Revelation we have the mysteries of Christ as the life supply to God&#8217;s children for His expression and as the center of the divine administration of the Triune God. In Revelation the veil is open so that we may have a view of the divine administration. In this book we can see the universal &#8220;White House.&#8221; Even now, Christ, the Lamb on the throne, is the mysterious Administrator, the mysterious center of God&#8217;s universal administration. At this very moment, Christ is carrying out God&#8217;s administration.<h2 class=head1>II. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><h2 class=head2>A. A Book of Signs</h2><p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs, not of miracles. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke we read of miracles. But in the Gospel of John the word miracle is not used. Instead, this Gospel speaks of signs. For example, the changing of water into wine is called the beginning of signs (John 2:11).<p>A sign is a symbol with a particular significance. All the figures in John&#8217;s Gospel are signs. John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word....&#8221; The Word is a sign. Some teachers of the Bible would argue that the Lamb and the Dove may be signs, but that the Word is not a sign, because it is a title of Christ. Revelation 19:13 says that His name is called The Word of God. I would reply that every name is a sign. A street sign, for example, bears a name. Also, on the street we have signboards, and signboards bear names. Why are these boards not called name-boards instead of signboards? The reason is that a name is a sign. In John 1:42 the Lord Jesus told Simon that he would be called Peter, a name that means a stone. This indicates that the name Peter is a sign that Peter is a stone. The same is true in principle of the Word being a sign.<p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs signifying the divine Person, divine things, and divine matters. It is rather easy to see how the signs are related to the divine Person. However, the divine things in the Gospel of John may be somewhat puzzling. What are the divine things in this Gospel? The divine things include the divine life, divine light, divine grace, divine truth, divine glory, divine authority, divine children, divine food, divine water, divine breath, the divine vine, divine oneness, and divine building. These are the divine things in this book.<p>What are the divine matters? One divine matter is divine enlightenment. Divine light is a thing, but divine enlightenment is a matter. Other divine matters are regeneration, resurrection, reproduction, sanctification, building up, and glorification. In the matter of divine reproduction, one grain of wheat produces many grains. Sanctification is a matter, whereas holiness is a thing. Building up is the procedure, the action, of the building work. Eventually, in John 17, we have both sanctification and glorification. In this chapter the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&#8221; (v. 1). Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have the divine Person, the divine things, and the divine matters.<h2 class=head2>B. The Prologue of the Entire Book</h2><p>Chapter one is the prologue of the Gospel of John. In this prologue we have the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God. The Word is the defined God (vv. 1-2). The tabernacle is the defined God mingled with humanity to be His own dwelling place among men (v. 14). The Lamb of God is the representation of all the offerings for the solving of the problem of sin between man and God so that man may enter into God, enter into the tabernacle (vv. 29, 36). The Dove upon the Lamb is the Redeemer becoming the life-giving Spirit so that God may enter into man to be his life that man may be regenerated, transformed, and built up with the divine life to be the house of God (v. 32). The stone signifies the natural man as clay transformed into precious stone for the building of God&#8217;s house. The house of God is the building up of the transformed believers as stones to be the enlarged Christ as the house of God, the gate of heaven, a ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven (v. 51). All these signs are wonderful. With the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house we have the extracts of chapter one of John&#8217;s gospel. Hallelujah for the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIX SIGNS IN JOHN 1</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-5, 14, 16-18, 29, 36, 32-33, 41-42, 12-13, 51</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the significance of the six signs in John 1. These signs are the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.<h2 class=head1>I. THE WORD</h2><p>The Word is eternal; that is, it is self-existing, without beginning (Heb. 7:3). This is contrary to the heretical teaching that says the Word, the Logos, was created by God. According to the revelation in John&#8217;s Gospel, the Word was not created. However, the Word became flesh (John 1:14), and the flesh is a created element. John 1:1 says that the Word was in the beginning. This reveals that the Word is eternal. Then John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, something created by God. By this we may say that John reconciles the schools of thought that say respectively that Christ was God and not man and that He was man and not God. This is the reason some teachers say that John&#8217;s writings are conciliatory. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, we prefer to say that the writings of John are all-inclusive. John reveals that, on the one hand, the Word is eternal, uncreated, but that, on the other hand, He became flesh, something created by God.<p>The Word is living, a divine Person, Christ the Son of the living God (Rev. 19:13). The eternal Word is our Lord Jesus Christ, and the living Word is also He. Furthermore, Christ is the written Word, the holy writings, the Bible (Heb. 10:7; Luke 24:27, 44). Christ is also the spoken Word, the rhema, the instant word to be spirit and life to man (John 6:63). Therefore, Christ is the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word. Such a Word signifies the mysterious and invisible God defined and expressed. Concerning this, John 1:18 says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; Also, according to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the express image of His substance. As the Word, Christ is the definition and expression of God. Therefore, He could say, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&#8221; (John 14:9).<p>Through the Word all things came into existence (1:3; Heb. 11:3). According to John 1:4 and 5, in Him are the divine life (God imparted) and the divine light (God shining).<h2 class=head1>II. THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; This incarnated Word is a tabernacle. This tabernacle signifies the Word becoming flesh as God&#8217;s expression. Here the word &#8220;expression&#8221; is the same in significance as the gold in the tabernacle. The tabernacle was built with boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Anyone who entered the tabernacle would see the shining gold, the gold that signifies God expressed. When Christ was on earth, there was a certain kind of shining with Him. That shining is the expression of God, which is typified by the gold of the tabernacle. Eventually, we also shall be overlaid with shining gold.<p>As the tabernacle, Christ, the incarnated Word, shared in humanity. For the Word to become flesh means that the Word took on human nature. Humanity is typified by the acacia wood of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15, 29). The shining gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature of Christ and His human nature, His humanity.<p>As the tabernacle, Christ is God&#8217;s embodiment. Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; Not only was the Father embodied in Christ, but the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in Him. This means that the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment is God&#8217;s dwelling among men.<p>The fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle so that man can enter into God and enjoy Him. Originally, God was mysterious, invisible, and untouchable. But now God has been embodied in a tabernacle that can be entered, one that we may call an enterable tabernacle. This means that God is enterable; we can enter into Him and enjoy Him. Once we enter into God, we may say that we can walk around in Him to enjoy Him. We may enjoy Him as our life supply, signified by the bread on the showbread table, and as our light, signified by the lampstand. In particular, we may enjoy Him as the ark. Then we may abide at the incense altar not only to commune with Him, but also to intercede for His eternal purpose. How marvelous!<p>Our God today is different from the God of the Jews. In a sense, He is even somewhat different from the God experienced by many Christians. The God we experience and enjoy in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the One revealed in the Bible. Hallelujah, our God is enterable, and we can enjoy Him!<p>With the tabernacle we have grace (God enjoyed) and reality (God realized). John 1:16 and 17 say, &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&#8221; Grace is the enjoyment of God for man, and reality is the realization of God for man. Therefore, grace is God enjoyed by man, and reality is God realized by man. When we enter into the tabernacle, we may enjoy the bread, the light, and the ark. All this is grace. What grace we enjoy at the showbread table and at the lampstand! We especially enjoy grace at the ark, with the hidden manna and the cherubim. As we are enjoying God, we fully realize Him. He becomes our life supply, our light, our hidden manna, our budding rod, and our law. What a marvelous reality this is!<p>The tabernacle in John 1:14 is just a beginning. This tabernacle will consummate in the eternal tabernacle in the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:2-3). The entire Bible consummates in one item-the tabernacle. Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God. The tabernacle we have today will have a consummation, and the consummate tabernacle will be the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>III. THE LAMB OF GOD</h2><p>John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; The Lamb of God signifies the Word in the flesh as the representation of all the offerings to accomplish God&#8217;s full redemption. Christ is the totality of all the offerings. He is not only the sin offering, but also the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, the freewill offering, and the drink offering. With Christ as all the offerings we have God&#8217;s full salvation and full redemption. Through Christ as the Lamb of God representing all the offerings, we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature (John 3:14-15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Because of Christ as the Lamb of God, we are well able, even enabled, to enter into God. We may boldly come into God, knowing that God does not have the right to reject us, because we come through the Lamb. We have full redemption in Christ, and therefore we are enabled to enter into God to enjoy all that He is.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE DOVE UPON THE LAMB</h2><p>According to John 1:32, John the Baptist testified, saying, &#8220;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.&#8221; The One upon whom the Spirit descended was the Lamb. Matthew 3:16 says, &#8220;And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him.&#8221; Therefore, we have the Dove upon the Lamb. John the Baptist could testify that he saw a heavenly Dove descending upon the Lamb of God and abiding upon this Lamb. In this way the two, the Lamb and the Dove, became one entity. We may refer to this entity as a Dove-Lamb.<p>Some theologians use the term &#8220;pneumatic Christ.&#8221; The Dove-Lamb is the pneumatic Christ. The word pneumatic, meaning spiritual, is an adjective derived from the Greek word for spirit, pneuma. After His resurrection, Christ became the pneumatic Christ, the Dove-Lamb. However, many theologians and Bible teachers see Christ only as the Lamb, not as the Dove-Lamb. This means that they see only the Christ in the flesh, not the pneumatic Christ. Who is this pneumatic Christ? According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, He is the last Adam who has become the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. Today Christ is not merely the Lamb nor merely the Dove. He is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the Dove-Lamb.<p>The Dove-Lamb signifies the Redeemer in the flesh, after accomplishing redemption, becoming the life-giving Spirit to impart the divine life into man. This is for man to be regenerated (John 3:5-6), transformed (2 Cor. 3:18), and built up into the house of God to express Him in a corporate way (1 Tim. 3:15-16). This is a marvelous vision that we all need to see. How I thank God that He has given us the light concerning this and the utterance to express it!<h2 class=head1>V. THE STONE</h2><p>According to John 1:42, when the Lord Jesus first looked at Peter, He said, &#8220;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).&#8221; The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:12). The stone in John 1:42 signifies the believers in Christ, after being born of God, regenerated, by receiving Him (vv. 12-13) to be transformed into living precious stones. This is for the building of the church, the house of God (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). How wonderful it is to be transformed into living precious stones for the building of the church!<h2 class=head1>VI. THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>The house of God (John 1:51) signifies Christ increased with the church built up with the believers as stones and with the life-giving Spirit as the oil to be the enlarged house of God (Bethel) for the fulfillment of Jacob&#8217;s dream (Gen. 28:10-19). As the universal ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven and thereby makes God and man one for eternity. Jacob&#8217;s dream is being fulfilled today. We in the church are experiencing the fulfillment of this dream. We have Christ in His humanity as the universal ladder joining earth to heaven and heaven to earth. In Him God and man become one for eternity.<p>John 1:42 reveals that the believers are stones, and verse 51 refers to the house of God. We are not only individual stones-we are a part of the house of God. This requires that we be built up together as God&#8217;s house. What is your situation with respect to the building of God&#8217;s house? Are you scattered, piled up, or built up? To be scattered means that we do not come together with the believers in the meetings. To be piled up together means that we do nothing more than come to the meetings. The gathering of building materials is for the building up. For example, several years ago we bought a great many materials for the building of this meeting hall in Anaheim. First those materials were piled up on the building site. But after several months, those materials became the building. Now we no longer have materials piled up-we have a building. This is an illustration of the fact that in the church life we should not be only a pile of materials, but materials which have been built together into God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE SIX SIGNS COVERING BOTH THE SPAN AND THE SCOPE OF THE CENTRAL LINE OF GOD&#8217;S ENTIRE ECONOMY</h2><p>The six signs in John 1 cover both the span and the scope of the central line of God&#8217;s entire economy. God&#8217;s economy is the universal story, a story that involves a number of great mysteries. The first of these mysteries is the universe itself. The vastness of the universe is beyond measure. We may say that the measure of the universe is Christ Himself, for in Paul&#8217;s words, Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth (Eph. 3:18). Our human mind is not able to comprehend such vastness. In this vast universe there is an economy, a divine operation.<p>God&#8217;s economy as the universal story is fully embodied in the Word. At the beginning of both his Gospel and his first Epistle, John speaks concerning the Word. As the story of the universal economy, the Word is the embodiment of the Triune God. Although the Triune God is mysterious, He is nonetheless embodied in the Word. The Word denotes the definition, explanation, and expression of God. The Triune God embodied in the Word is explained, defined, and expressed. Therefore, the Word is the definition and expression of the mysterious and invisible God.<p>The Word is the wonderful, all-inclusive, divine Person. He is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature. He includes all the divine things and all the divine matters. This Word is revealed and developed in the writings of John in his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation.<p>According to John 1:14, the Word as the embodiment of the Triune God became flesh. This flesh is the tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>In the four Gospels we see a portrait of the tabernacle in motion. When Christ was on earth, He was a living and moving tabernacle. He could travel from Galilee to Judea. He could stay for a while in Jerusalem and then go to Samaria. Hence, we may say that He was a traveling tabernacle.<p>While the Lord Jesus was on earth as God&#8217;s tabernacle, no one was able to enter into Him, because the way had not been prepared and the entrance was not open. For this reason, after thirty-three and a half years on earth, He suddenly told His disciples that He was going away. This troubled the disciples, for they thought that He was leaving them forever. Then the Lord revealed to them that His going was actually His coming. It seems that the Lord was saying to them, &#8220;If I do not go away, I would only be here among you. You would not be able to enter into Me, and I would not have a way to come into you. Therefore, I need to go away through death and resurrection to accomplish redemption for you and to open the way for you to come into Me.&#8221; Through death and resurrection the Lord opened the gate and prepared the way for us to come into Him as the living, moving tabernacle, the very God embodied in the flesh.<p>Furthermore, after dying to accomplish redemption, the Lord changed His form and in resurrection became the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit. This makes it possible for Him to enter into us. Therefore, in John 14 the Lord also seemed to be saying to the disciples, &#8220;On the day of My resurrection you will know that I am in the Father, that you are in Me, and that I am in you. Today I am still the tabernacle among you, but outside of you. You are outside of Me, and you have no way to come into Me. Neither is there a way for Me to enter into you. This is the reason that I must die to accomplish redemption and open the way that you may enter into Me as the tabernacle and that the Triune God, embodied in Me, may enter into you. Then where I am, there you will be also (John 14:3; 17:24). You will know that I am in the Father, that you are in Me, and that I am in you.&#8221;<p>On the day of His resurrection, the Lord appeared to His disciples. Although the door was shut, He suddenly and mysteriously appeared. Then He breathed on them and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). In this way He entered into the disciples.<p>In John 1 we have the Lord as the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the Dove. The Dove is one with the Lamb, becoming the Dove-Lamb. The Dove-Lamb is another aspect of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is the embodiment of the Word, and the Word is the embodiment of the Triune God. Now the Triune God in the Word, the Word in the tabernacle, and the tabernacle through the Lamb with the Dove may enter into people to regenerate them and transform them into precious stones to be built up together as God&#8217;s house. God&#8217;s house today is the church. But the consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God in its consummation, in eternity. This is the story of God&#8217;s economy, a story that is altogether wrapped up with the Person of the living Word.<p>The living Word and the written Word are one. The living Word is the reality of the written Word, and the written Word is the definition of the living Word. The living Word said that in Moses, the Psalms, and the prophets many things were written concerning Him. In Luke 24 He expounded to some of the disciples the things in the Scriptures concerning Himself (v. 27). By this we see that in the Bible we have the story of the Word. Christ is the Word, and the Bible also is the Word. The Word was and still is the eternal and the living Word. As we have seen, the living Word is also the written Word. When Christ, the living Word spoke, this spoken Word was the rhema, which is spirit and life to us (John 6:63). Therefore, the universal story is a story of the Word, and this Word is the universal economy of God. In this economy we can see a Person, the living Word, with the written Word and the spoken Word.<p>The Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is embodied in the flesh, and this flesh is the tabernacle. The embodiment of God becomes His dwelling and our dwelling. Simultaneously, this incarnate Word is the totality of all the offerings to accomplish redemption and prepare the way for us to enter into God and for God to enter into us. After accomplishing redemption, He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us. When He came into us, all the elements included in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit also came into us. These elements include God, man, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now the divine life with the divine nature has been imparted into our being to make us stones and to build us together to be the church. Eventually, the churches in the different localities will consummate in the New Jerusalem. This is the economy of God.<p>The six signs in John 1-the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God-cover the entire central line of God&#8217;s economy. This economy is altogether a story of the Word, a story of the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word that is spirit and life to us. May we all understand the story of this Word.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIGNS OF CHANGING WATER INTO WINE AND THE RAISING UP OF THE DESTROYED TEMPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11, 18-22</h1><p>The Gospel of John is a deep book. We cannot exhaust the mysteries of the divine life revealed in this Gospel. Because the divine life is immeasurable, it is called eternal life. The word &#8220;eternal&#8221; refers to the elements of both time and space. Eternal life is unlimited, immeasurable; it has no limit and no ending in either time or space.<p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is a book of signs. These signs are related to the divine life. In foregoing messages we have been impressed with six major signs in chapter one: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. Every chapter in the Gospel of John is a chapter of signs. This is true even of the last chapter, chapter twenty-one.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SIGNS IN JOHN 2</h2><p>In this message we come to chapter two of John, where two important matters are recorded. The first is the changing of water into wine, and the second is the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the destroying of the temple and raising it up again in three days. Apparently, the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the temple has nothing to do with the incident of the changing of water into wine. Actually, these two matters are closely related.<p>After the Lord cleansed the temple (2:12-17), &#8220;the Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign will you show us, seeing that you do these things?&#8221; (v. 18). The Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (v. 19). In purifying the temple the Lord Jesus displayed a very strong character. At that time He was not meek or gentle. Religious people would never expect that Jesus, the One with such a meek and humble heart, could do this. The religious leaders probably thought that the Lord had gone too far. In response to their word concerning a sign, the Lord said for them to destroy this temple and that He would raise it up in three days. According to John 2:20, the Jews then said, &#8220;It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?&#8221; The Jews, of course, were thinking of the temple in Jerusalem, but the Lord &#8220;spoke of the temple of His body&#8221; (v. 21). The Lord was referring to the temple of His universal, mystical Body. Who is able to measure this temple? It is impossible for anyone to measure it.<p>The religious ones did not realize that the Lord Jesus was saying that His physical body, not the temple in Jerusalem, was the real temple. The Lord used that material building in Jerusalem as a sign to denote His physical body. The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus, but the body of Jesus was &#8220;destroyed&#8221; by the Jews when they had Him crucified. But on the third day, that destroyed body was raised up. Jesus said, &#8220;In three days I will raise it up.&#8221; The wording here is different from the record in the synoptic Gospels, which for the most part say that God will raise up the Lord Jesus. In John 2 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &#8220;You kill Me, and I will raise Myself up. Destroy this physical body, which is the real temple, and I will raise it up in three days. Once I raise up this temple, it will be enlarged.&#8221; This enlarged temple is Christ&#8217;s universal Body.<p>We are told clearly that the incident of the changing of water into wine was a sign: &#8220;This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee&#8221; (2:11). However, we are not told clearly that the matter of the raising up of the destroyed body is also a sign. But Matthew 12:38-40 indicates that the resurrection of Christ is also a sign. When some of the scribes and Pharisees said, &#8220;Teacher, we want to see a sign from you,&#8221; the Lord replied, &#8220;An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.&#8221; Here we see that the Lord&#8217;s resurrection is the unique sign to this perverted generation. Therefore, in the second chapter of John we have two signs: the changing of water into wine and the resurrection of Christ. In this message we shall seek to get into the depths of these two signs.<p>John 20:30 and 31 say, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221; These verses indicate that John selected a certain number of signs and used them to compose his Gospel. John&#8217;s use of signs in writing his Gospel can be compared to our use of letters to make words and of words to write an article. Thus, the signs in this Gospel are the &#8220;letters&#8221; used to compose it. For example, two of the signs in John 1 concern the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God and Peter as a stone for God&#8217;s building. In chapter two John selected two incidents-the changing of water into wine and the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the temple in Jerusalem-and used them as signs in composing this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE THIRD DAY</h2><p>Three times in chapter one John speaks of &#8220;the next day&#8221; (vv. 29, 35, and 43). Then in 2:1 he says, &#8220;And the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.&#8221; According to the sequence, this should actually be the fifth day, for there have been the first day, three &#8220;next days,&#8221; and now the day mentioned in 2:1. But instead of saying the fifth day, John speaks in 2:1 of the third day. In order to use the expression &#8220;the third day&#8221; in 2:1, John repeatedly speaks of the next day in chapter one.<p>Each of the two incidents in chapter two is related to a third day. The third day in 2:1 was the day on which the Lord changed water into wine. In 2:19 the Lord said that &#8220;in three days&#8221; He would raise up the temple of His body. The expressions &#8220;the third day&#8221; and &#8220;in three days&#8221; both refer to resurrection. The Lord Jesus was raised up in three days. According to the New Testament, He was also raised up on the third day. The point here is that both expressions denote resurrection. By the use of these two expressions John indicates that the two signs in chapter two are both related to the Lord&#8217;s resurrection.<h2 class=head1>COMING IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>John 2:1 indicates that it was on the third day that the Lord Jesus came to Cana of Galilee. This means that the Lord came in resurrection. When the Lord Jesus came to us, He came in resurrection. However, we may think that the Lord first came to the disciples in incarnation, not in resurrection. We would probably say, &#8220;When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He came to the disciples. Certainly He came as a Man of Nazareth in incarnation. How can we say that He came in resurrection when He had not yet been crucified?&#8221; In 11:25 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; Notice that here the Lord says, &#8220;I am the resurrection&#8221;; He does not say, &#8220;I shall be the resurrection.&#8221; Even as a Man of Nazareth in the flesh, the Lord could say, &#8220;I am the resurrection.&#8221; According to the human concept, He was present merely in incarnation. But from God&#8217;s point of view in His economy, the Lord came to Cana of Galilee in resurrection, Cana means a land of reeds, and reeds signify weak and fragile people (Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20; 11:7). It was in resurrection that the Lord Jesus came to the weak and fragile people in Cana of Galilee-a despised place.<p>According to the Gospel of John, the Lord came to the people in resurrection. If He had not been in resurrection, but only in incarnation, He could not have changed water into wine. Only the One who is the divine life could do such a thing in resurrection.<p>The Lord was also in resurrection when He spoke to the Samaritan woman in chapter four. He indicated to her that He had the living water. How could a man in the flesh have living water? This is impossible. We know that the Samaritan woman received the living water from the Lord Jesus because she was satisfied, as indicated by the fact that she left her waterpot. When she went into the city to testify, she was bubbling. Living water was gushing out of her. She had obtained this living water from Christ who is in resurrection.<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus revealed that He is the living bread, the bread of God that came down out of heaven to give life to the world. He also said, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (6:57). The Lord Jesus did not say, &#8220;He who will eat Me after My resurrection will live.&#8221; On the contrary, He spoke in the present tense. When He said that He was the living bread from heaven, He seemed to be saying to the people, &#8220;Do not think of Me merely as one who grew up in Nazareth. I came down from heaven.&#8221; In chapter six of John the Lord Jesus was in resurrection.<p>The fact that the Lord came to Cana of Galilee on the third day indicates that He comes to us in resurrection. We are weak and fragile people living in a despised place. But in resurrection the Lord has come to us. Sometimes I am beside myself with joy when I think of this. Praise the Lord that He has come to me in resurrection! This makes me happy and causes me to flow with living water.<p>Once the Lord Jesus comes into us, He will never leave. He will stay with us for eternity. How wonderful that in resurrection Christ is with us and in us! Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus came to our Cana on the third day!<h2 class=head1>THE WEDDING FEAST OF HUMAN LIFE</h2><p>The Lord Jesus went to Cana for the purpose of attending a wedding feast. We may say that all of our human life is a &#8220;wedding feast.&#8221; From the time the Lord came to us, He has been attending our wedding feast. As long as we live on earth, every day is a &#8220;wedding day.&#8221; Whether this &#8220;wedding&#8221; is genuine or not genuine, long lasting or lasting a short time, every day we have some kind of wedding. Probably you are wondering what I mean by this. To say that every day is a wedding and that human life is a wedding feast means that throughout our life we hope, or expect, good things to happen to us. A wedding is something pleasant, something that makes us happy. For example, a young person may work hard on his studies in order to pass all his examinations. When he graduates with honors, others congratulate him. His graduation is something pleasant, something which may be called a &#8220;wedding.&#8221; Another brother may receive a promotion or a raise in salary. That promotion or raise may also be considered a &#8220;wedding.&#8221; Likewise, we have many pleasant things, many &#8220;weddings,&#8221; in our human life.<h2 class=head1>THE WINE RUNNING OUT</h2><p>During the course of the wedding feast in Cana, &#8220;the wine ran out&#8221; (2:3). We can testify that in every human &#8220;wedding feast&#8221; the wine eventually runs out. Wine, the life juice of the grape, signifies life. Hence, the wine running out symbolizes the human life running out. For example, a young sister may think that the brother she has married under the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty is a &#8220;hero.&#8221; But after a while, the wine will run out of her married life. Nevertheless, at that very juncture, the Lord Jesus is present to change water into wine.<p>In our human life the &#8220;wine&#8221; will always run out. However, Christ in resurrection never &#8220;runs out.&#8221; Suppose a brother receives a promotion at work. That promotion is a &#8220;wedding,&#8221; even a wedding feast. But eventually he will be disappointed with that promotion. This disappointment signifies that the wine has run out at that particular wedding feast.<p>Perhaps a brother receives a new car as a graduation gift. For a long time, he has been looking forward to having that car. But eventually the &#8220;wine&#8221; of that &#8220;car-wedding&#8221; will run out.<p>What kind of wine does not eventually run out? Our health, our money, and our possessions sooner or later will run out. A sister may be happy with a new pair of shoes. When she buys these shoes, she enjoys wine at her wedding feast. But this wine also will run out. Only what the Lord Jesus gives never runs out.<p>As an elderly brother with experience in human life, I can testify that nothing in this present life is lasting. Everything is running out. Only the Lord Jesus Christ is eternal, everlasting. Hallelujah, He is here with us to change our death water into wine, into eternal life!<h2 class=head1>CHANGING WATER INTO WINE</h2><p>Another word for the changing of water into wine, the changing of death into life, is transformation. Transformation is implied by the word &#8220;stone&#8221; in 1:42. The transformation in John 1 is equal to the changing of water into wine in John 2.<p>I can testify that every day the Lord changes my water into wine. Today I definitely experienced this at least three times. I had a sense of death, but the Lord Jesus transformed my death water into eternal life.<p>Do you know what the genuine Christian life is? The Christian life is a life of changing water into wine. The Christian life is not a character-changing life or a behavior-improving life. The Christian life is altogether a matter of changing our death into life.<p>Sometimes we are conscious of the changing of death into life, but at other times we are not aware of this. Many times we experience this change unconsciously or subconsciously. This is the reason that we may be surprised at the change that has taken place within us. We may say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, is this me? I would not have thought that I am able to live such a life. I am amazed that I can endure so much and bear so much. Oh, what a surprise!&#8221; However, the Lord Jesus would say, &#8220;There is no need for you to be surprised. I have changed your death water into life wine.&#8221;<p>In the church life and under the ministry, we experience the Lord changing our death into life. Parents may find it hard to believe the positive change that has taken place in their children over the period of a few years. This is the changing of water into wine.<p>I have the full confidence that in the church life the Lord is changing death into life. We cannot deny the fact that certain things have happened to disappoint us. But I would like to say that I have been quite encouraged with the churches. The Lord knows that I am happy to minister the Word to the saints, for there is evidence that water is being changed into wine in the experience of so many dear ones. This is the experience of the Lord Jesus in resurrection. He dwells in us, and every day He is changing our water into wine.<p>Consider how the Lord has changed you throughout the years. Perhaps a married brother should sit down with his wife and ask her to point out to him how the Lord has changed his water into wine, his death into life. The brother may say to his wife, &#8220;Dear, tell me how you feel about my situation. How am I today compared with what I was two years ago?&#8221; If the brother and his wife are honest, they will be able to assure each other that over the years Christ in resurrection has been changing their death water into life wine. I believe that this has been the experience of the majority of the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Praise the Lord that in resurrection He is changing water into wine! He is not merely improving our behavior-He is transforming us.<h2 class=head1>BUILDING UP THE MYSTICAL BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Let us now consider the other sign in John 2, the sign of building up the mystical body of Christ. We need to realize that the rebuilding of the destroyed temple has already been accomplished. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection we all have been resurrected. Peter tells us that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3). This means that in God&#8217;s view, according to His accomplishment in His economy, the Body of Christ has already been built.<p>The tense of the verbs in the book of Revelation indicates this. For example, the Apostle John does not say that the New Jerusalem will come; he tells us that he saw the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God. Approximately nineteen hundred years ago, John saw the New Jerusalem. This shows us that, according to God&#8217;s way of seeing, the Body of Christ has already been built up.<p>Do you know what our living is? Our living as Christians is simply a matter of the changing of death into life for the building up of the mystical Body of Christ. The entire Christian life consists of two matters: changing death into life and building up the mystical Body of Christ. This is the proper, genuine, and complete Christian life. There is no third item in our Christian life. Now we are in this building by our daily living, and our daily living is a matter of changing water into wine.<p>We may summarize our Christian life by saying that the Christian life is the changing of death into life, water into wine, for the building up of the Body of Christ. What is our living? Our living is the changing of death into life. What are we doing here? We are carrying out the work of building up the church, the Body of Christ. This is our living, and this is our goal. Our living is the changing of death into life. Our goal is the building up of the church. We have a living of the eternal life, the eternal zoe, for the purpose of building up the mystical Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT</h2><p>This message is a word of encouragement. We all should be encouraged by what is revealed in chapter two of John. In the church life we are doing the work of building in three days, that is, in resurrection.<p>Some may say, &#8220;Brother Lee, on some occasions you have told us that we are short, lacking, and somewhat off from the central vision of God&#8217;s economy.&#8221; Yes, in the past I have spoken concerning our shortcomings. But what we have in John 2 is a word of encouragement. Many things have both a positive side and a negative side. But the positive side is not for the negative side. Rather, the negative side is for the positive side. I do not know if this is true in physics, but I know it is true in &#8220;spiritual physics.&#8221; According to my experience in the Christian life, the negative side is for the positive side. Every time I have a defeat, I soon enjoy a victory, and every sorrow is followed by joy. This is why I say that the negative side is always for the positive side.<p>As believers in Christ, we are not a people without hope. On the contrary, we are a people full of hope. Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, God the Father has regenerated us unto a living hope. We have the eternal life within us as our hope. With eternal life, everything is hopeful. We may still be short and somewhat off from God&#8217;s goal. However, we cannot deny the fact that the situation among us today is much better than it was years ago. I can testify that there is more building in the churches than there was some years ago or even a few months ago. This is the raising up of the destroyed temple in three days.<p>According to the Lord&#8217;s word in John 2, He allowed the enemy to destroy the temple of His body. That was a test to resurrection life. There is also a test to resurrection life in our experience in the church life. Let the enemy destroy God&#8217;s temple. We have resurrection power within us. Without the negative side, this positive power could not be manifested. Everything else is going down, but the church exists forever. We may fluctuate, but the church never fluctuates.<p>When some hear this, they may say, &#8220;This I cannot believe. I feel that a few years ago the church in my locality was wonderful. We were happy and excited. But now the condition of the church is worse.&#8221; I would reply that your feeling, which is related to something outward, is not true. Perhaps in the past there was more excitement, more shouting, more so-called release in singing. That, however, is not life. I have the full assurance that there is more life in the churches today than even a few years ago. I can say this because I have the assurance that many of us are living a water-changing life, and by this life we live in the building.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING THE BUILDING</h2><p>Although the building of the church is taking place, we ourselves cannot build the church. Some may find this hard to believe and say, &#8220;In the past you told us to endeavor to build up the church. Now you are saying that we cannot build up the church.&#8221; On the one hand, the church has already been built, and there is no need for us to build it. On the other hand, the building of the church is still going on in resurrection. In a very real sense, we do not need to build the church. Instead, we should simply stay in the building and enjoy it.<p>In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; Are these three days over, or are they still going on? It is difficult to answer this question. As far as accomplishment is concerned, the three days are over. But as far as enjoyment is concerned, we are still in these three days. Are we, then, accomplishing the building, or are we enjoying what has already been built? It is hard for our limited mentality to answer this question. According to our way of thinking, we are still doing the work of building. Apparently, we are doing the work of building; actually, we are enjoying what has already been built. We may experience the building in resurrection every day. I am not speaking something I have not experienced. What I am telling you is what I have been experiencing and enjoying. Day by day, I enjoy what the Lord Jesus has accomplished in His resurrection.<p>In chapter two of John there are two signs. The first is the changing of water into wine; the second is the raising up of the destroyed temple of God. Thank the Lord that today we are for this and in it. We have this living, and we are for this goal. We are living a life of changing water into wine for the unique purpose of building up Christ&#8217;s mystical Body.<p>The Gospel of John is deep because it gives the mysterious stories of the divine life. Most of today&#8217;s Christians neglect the mysterious matters revealed in this Gospel. We thank the Lord that He has brought us into these mysterious stories of the divine life. Because these matters are mysterious, we cannot adequately utter all that we see concerning them. However, I believe that the Spirit will speak much more to you than I am able to speak. Then we shall all enjoy an inner, mutual understanding concerning the changing of death into life for the building up of the Body of Christ. Praise the Lord for the revelation in John 2! In this chapter we see the changing of water into wine for the unique and glorious goal of building up the mystical Body of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36</h1><h2 class=head1>MYSTERIES AND SIGNS</h2><p>In these messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, it is not our intention to review the Life-study of the Gospel of John. Our intention is to concentrate on the extract of every chapter. The way to get the extract of each chapter is to pay attention to the signs in this mysterious book. The Gospel of John is a book of mysteries and also a book of signs. A mystery points to something that is beyond our natural understanding, and a sign points to something deep. Therefore, I would emphasize the importance of these two matters-mysteries and signs.<p>All the mysteries in the Gospel of John are divine. For instance, many Bible students know that the Gospel of John is a book on life. To be sure, this life is neither physical life nor psychological life, not even merely spiritual life; it is divine life, the very life of God. Actually, this divine life is God Himself. This is the eternal life revealed in this Gospel.<p>The divine life in the Gospel of John is a mystery. Not only is the life of God a mystery; every kind of life is a mystery. This is true of our physical life, and it is also true even of plant life. The life of a fruit tree, for example, is a mystery.<p>In the Gospel of John there are many divine matters, and each of these matters is a mystery. Everything divine is mysterious and difficult to define. Although the mysterious divine things cannot be fully understood, they are facts nonetheless. We may not be able to define the mysterious matter of the divine life, the life of God, but this life exists, and it is a mystery.<p>The divine life is not only a mystery; it is also a sign. We may use our physical life as an illustration. Suppose a certain brother stands up to speak in a meeting. Within him there is the mysterious matter of his physical life. That life is invisible. However, that mysterious and invisible life can be expressed through the gestures he uses when he speaks. The brother&#8217;s gestures will signify certain things. In like manner, the mysterious, divine life may express itself in signs. In every chapter of the Gospel of John there are signs that point to the divine mysteries.<p>We have seen that in chapter one of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. These six signs give us a complete picture.<p>In chapter two there are two signs. The first sign, the changing of water into wine, sets forth the principle of life, which is to change death into life. The second sign, that of rebuilding the destroyed temple, shows us the goal of life, which is to build up God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth.<h2 class=head1>THE REBUILT TABERNACLE</h2><p>The overall subject of all the extracts in the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. This means that in the extracts we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. Chapter two of John, in particular, reveals the tabernacle. The building up of the destroyed temple is certainly related to the reality of the tabernacle. This rebuilt temple is the very tabernacle into which we must enter.<p>The first mention of the tabernacle in the Gospel of John is in 1:14: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; Then in chapter two we again see the tabernacle. In chapter two this tabernacle was first the physical body of the Lord Jesus, God incarnate. The Lord said, &#8220;Destroy this temple&#8221; (2:19). &#8220;This temple&#8221; corresponds to the tabernacle in 1:14. We have seen that this tabernacle is the incarnated Christ. At a certain time, the temple of the Lord&#8217;s physical body was destroyed by the Jews. Following that, the divine life within the Lord Jesus rebuilt that destroyed temple. Now this rebuilt temple has become the real temple, the real tabernacle.<p>The tabernacle in 1:14 was real; however, it was not as real as the rebuilt temple in chapter two. The tabernacle in 1:14 was only in the flesh. But when it had been destroyed and rebuilt, it was in resurrection. To be in resurrection is to be in the Spirit. Therefore, the rebuilt tabernacle is the real tabernacle in the Spirit.<p>Furthermore, the tabernacle in 1:14 did not include us. But the rebuilt temple in chapter two not only includes us; it is also composed of us. The genuine entering into the tabernacle means that we are included in the composition of this tabernacle. Today the rebuilt tabernacle is the church. By what way do we enter the church as God&#8217;s tabernacle? We enter the tabernacle by being built into it, not by merely coming into it. If you only come into the tabernacle, you may go out after a period of time. The only thing that can keep you in the tabernacle is the fact that you are built into it and you thus become a part of its composition.<p>Let us use a church meeting hall as an illustration. We come into the hall for a meeting, but after the meeting is over we leave the hall. However, the materials that have been built into the meeting hall, especially the beams and the columns, never leave it. The only way to remove the beams and the columns from the meeting hall would be to demolish the building.<p>In the same principle, we all should be built into the church as today&#8217;s tabernacle of God (Rev. 3:12). I do not believe that anyone can take me out of the church life, because I have been built into the church and have become part of it. The only way to remove me from the church life would be to utterly destroy the whole church. If that were to happen, I would be destroyed along with the church. The point we are making is that the rebuilt temple in chapter two of John includes us all and is built with us all. This means that we are the temple, the tabernacle.<p>We need the types in Exodus and also the signs in the Gospel of John. If we did not have the Old Testament types, we would not have an adequate knowledge of the signs in John. Likewise, if we did not have the signs in the Gospel of John, we would not be able to have a deep understanding of the types in Exodus.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BE BUILT INTO THE TEMPLE</h2><p>Perhaps you are wondering how we can be built into the rebuilt temple. According to the signs in John 2, the way we are built into the temple is through the changing of death into life. The second sign in John 2, that of the rebuilt temple, depends on the first sign, that of changing water into wine. If water is not changed into wine, that is, if death is not changed into life, it will be impossible for the destroyed temple to be rebuilt.<p>Daily in the church life there may be some amount of destruction. Without the changing of water into wine, the changing of death into life, once the church has been destroyed, there would not be a way for it to be rebuilt. But the changing of death into life makes the rebuilding possible.<p>Because of the changing of death into life, we are not afraid of destruction. The church may be destroyed, but life will rebuild it. In the past we have experienced destruction. But we can praise the Lord that this destruction has brought in rebuilding by life. Through the changing of death into life we have experienced the rebuilding of the destroyed temple. Many of us can testify that years ago there was much death among us. Hallelujah, this death has been changed into life, and this life rebuilds the church!<p>Throughout the centuries, the mysteries and the signs in John have not been adequately seen by God&#8217;s people. How we thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has removed the veils to show these things to us! Now we can see things that are even deeper, richer, and more significant than what we covered in the Life-study of this Gospel.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF REGENERATION</h2><p>Let us now proceed to chapter three. In this chapter we have the signs of regeneration (vv. 1-8), the brass serpent (vv. 9-16), and the bride (vv. 22-36). Some may be surprised to hear that regeneration is a sign. In chapter three of John there is a definite ground for us to say that regeneration is a sign. In verse 2 Nicodemus said to the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.&#8221; This indicates that the subject of Nicodemus&#8217; conversation with the Lord is the signs He was doing. After Nicodemus referred to these signs, the Lord answered and said to him, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; (v. 3). Does this not indicate that being born anew is a sign? The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;You are talking about signs. I would like to speak about a sign that is certainly worthy of consideration. This is the sign of signs, the sign of being born anew.&#8221; Regeneration, therefore, is indeed a sign.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF REGENERATION</h2><p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is a book of mysteries and that these mysteries are divine. Do you not believe that our being regenerated is a mystery? No doubt, our regeneration is a mystery. Do you understand fully what regeneration is? Can you analyze it? Can you explain adequately what happened to you when you were regenerated? Can regeneration be studied scientifically in a laboratory? Scientists may say that there is no such thing as regeneration, for it is beyond their ability to analyze it. When we say that regeneration is a mystery, unbelieving scientists would say that this is altogether something unreal. But we would declare, &#8220;Regeneration is a reality. Your pride in your scientific knowledge is vanity. Regeneration is much more real than you are. Nothing you have and nothing you are is real. Everything is vanity. But our regeneration is the reality in human life. We can testify that in human experience nothing is as real as regeneration.&#8221;<p>What in our human life is more real than regeneration? Suppose you have a gold coin in your hand. That coin, of course, is real. You can look at it and touch it. But a gold coin is not as real as regeneration is. Regeneration is the greatest reality in human life.<p>But although regeneration is a reality, we cannot analyze it or understand it thoroughly. Furthermore, because regeneration is a mystery, it is also a sign. I can testify that after I was regenerated many things happened to me that I could not understand or explain. Has this not been your experience as well? Young people, since you have been regenerated, have your parents not had difficulty explaining certain things that have happened to you? The parents of a young brother may say, &#8220;What has happened to our son? He is quite different now from what he was before. As time goes by, he seems more and more different. We cannot explain what has happened, but we know definitely that he is not the same.&#8221; This is an illustration of regeneration being a sign.<p>A person who has been regenerated bears a sign upon him. Every genuine Christian, every one who has been born of God, bears such a sign. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but who does not have the sign of regeneration is a pseudo-Christian, a false believer. Regeneration is a sign, and every one who has been regenerated bears this sign.<h2 class=head1>BORN OF WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Regeneration denotes a new birth. This new birth has two elements; it includes being born of water and of the Spirit. In 3:5 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221; For generations, this verse has troubled Bible teachers and expositors. From the time I was saved and first began to love the Word of God, I was bothered by the expression &#8220;born of water and the Spirit.&#8221; I inquired of others and I read books on this matter in order to get the right understanding. However, no explanation fully satisfied me. Eventually, through the Lord&#8217;s mercy, I believe that we have received the proper understanding of what it means to be born of water and of the Spirit.<p>Some unusual interpretations have been given of the water in 3:5. In 1964 I was talking with some believers who strongly opposed the practice of water baptism. During the course of the conversation, I asked the leading one among them about the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the water and the Spirit in John 3:5. He answered by giving a very strange, peculiar, and extraordinary explanation of the words &#8220;born of water.&#8221; He said that the water in 3:5 signifies the water in the womb of our mother. He went on to say that every genuine Christian has experienced two births. In the first birth we pass through the water in our mother&#8217;s womb, and in the second birth we are born of the Holy Spirit. According to him, this is the meaning of being born of water and of the Spirit. I was astounded at that interpretation. I had been preaching and teaching the Bible for more than thirty years, and I had read a number of books on John 3. But never had I heard anyone say that the water in 3:5 refers to the water of our mother&#8217;s womb. Such an interpretation is altogether incredible and unreasonable. Can you imagine that when the Lord Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus, an elderly man, He was referring to the water of our mother&#8217;s womb? What a terrible thought! If that were the situation, then what is spoken of in 3:5 would not be a sign.<p>The words &#8220;of water and the Spirit&#8221; should have been plain to Nicodemus without any need of explanation. Similar words were spoken by John the Baptist to the Pharisees in Matthew 3:11. Hence, they should have been fully understood among the Pharisees. Here Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, is speaking to the Lord, and the Lord speaks these familiar words. Water was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation. Spirit is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. These two main concepts put together are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration. Regeneration, to be born anew, is the termination of people of the old creation with all their deeds and the germination of them in the new creation with the divine life.<p>According to Matthew 3:11 and 12 John the Baptist said, &#8220;I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.&#8221; Here John clearly speaks of baptismal water. He seemed to be saying to the Pharisees and Sadducees, &#8220;I baptize you only with water. Because I am merely a man, you may be a hypocrite and be able to cheat me. But you will not be able to deceive the One who is coming. He is not only man, but also God. He will baptize you either with the Spirit or with fire. If you are genuine, He will put you into the Spirit. But if you are hypocritical, one day He will put you into the fire.&#8221;<p>Nicodemus, a leading Pharisee, must have been familiar with the word of John the Baptist concerning water and the Spirit. The Lord Jesus must have realized this. Therefore, when Nicodemus spoke to Him regarding signs, the Lord told him about being born of water and of the Spirit. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;You need to be born of the water according to what John the Baptist said, and you also need to be born of the Spirit. John was the forerunner of My ministry and introduced to you the matters of baptism in water and in the Spirit. Now, Nicodemus, you must take the water and the Spirit. You must be born of the water and of the Spirit. Do you know what the water will do for you? The water will terminate you by burying you. Nicodemus, you are a gentleman with a good education and a high position in society. You refer to Me as a rabbi. You don&#8217;t need a rabbi, Nicodemus. You need someone to bury you. You don&#8217;t need more teaching. You already have enough. You need a burial, a burial in water. John tried to bury you in water, but you Pharisees wouldn&#8217;t take it. Now you come to Me and refer to Me as a teacher come from God. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you are born of the terminating water and the germinating Spirit, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>A NEW BEING</h2><p>Regeneration requires two elements-water and Spirit. On the negative side, the water terminates us; on the positive side, the Spirit germinates us. In this way we experience a new birth and become a new being. Birth always produces a being. When a child is born, this means a new being is produced.<p>The Lord went on to say to Nicodemus, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (v. 6). The Lord spoke this word in reply to what Nicodemus had said in verse 4: &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born, can he?&#8221; In verse 6 the Lord makes it clear that the new birth has nothing to do with the flesh. Nicodemus may have thought that he was wise and understanding. Actually, regarding the new birth, he was foolish and blind, thinking that regeneration involved returning to the mother&#8217;s womb to be born a second time. The Lord Jesus made it clear to him that to be born anew is to be terminated and to have a new being produced. What is terminated is of the flesh, and what is generated to become the new being is of the Spirit. Therefore, the Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, &#8220;Because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, you should let it be buried and forget about it. Even if a person could be born physically many times, he would still be flesh. Nicodemus, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. The new being is spirit.&#8221; This new birth to have a new being is a mystery and also a sign. Hallelujah, we have a new being, and this new being is spirit, not flesh!<p>In 3:8 the Lord Jesus went on to say to Nicodemus, &#8220;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is every one who is born of the Spirit.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s word here indicates that a regenerated person is like the wind, which can be realized but which is beyond understanding.<p>I hope that all the saints, especially those who have been saved in recent years, will have a clear understanding concerning their salvation. When we believed in the name of the Lord Jesus, we were regenerated to become a new being. Regeneration does not simply mean that we put away the things from the past and have a new beginning. Regeneration is a matter of terminating our old being and being generated to have a new being produced in us. With our old being we have the natural life, and with the new being we have the divine life. What we were was of the old life, the human life. What we received through regeneration is a new life, the divine life. This divine life is the seed of our new being.<p>Regeneration is absolutely not a matter of imitating what Christians do or repeating what they say. To be regenerated is to receive another life, eternal life, the life of God. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not have this divine life. But from the time we believed in the Lord and called on His name, we have had the life of God. When we were regenerated, the divine life was imparted into us to make us a new being. This is regeneration, which is both a mystery and a sign.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36</h1><p>In chapter three there are three signs: regeneration, the brass serpent, and the bride. In the foregoing message we covered the sign of regeneration. In this message we shall consider the signs of the brass serpent and the bride.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST TYPIFIED BY THE BRASS SERPENT</h2><p>John 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Here the Lord refers to what happened in Numbers 21:4-9. Numbers 21:5 says, &#8220;The people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.&#8221; Here we see that the children of Israel complained and were rebellious. As a result, &#8220;the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died&#8221; (Num. 21:6). Then the people came to Moses and confessed that they had sinned in speaking against the Lord and against him. They asked Moses to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents from them. When Moses prayed for the people, the Lord said to him, &#8220;Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live&#8221; (v. 8). We are told that Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole. Then &#8220;it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived&#8221; (v. 9).<p>The children of Israel who were bitten by serpents died- it was not merely a case of their becoming ill. Therefore, they needed not only to be healed, but to be enlivened, to be made alive again. In the sight of God the rebellious Israelites had become serpents, and those evil serpents were condemned and rejected by God. In order for the children of Israel to be rescued, it was necessary for them to be judged. They needed a substitute to bear this judgment for them. They were all serpents, and there was the need of a serpent to become their substitute to be judged by God for them. This was the reason the Lord told Moses to make a brass serpent and put it on a pole. That substitute serpent was not to have any poison. If that brass serpent had the poison of a real serpent, it could not have been a substitute for the serpentine people. The serpent used as a substitute had to be clean, without poison. The brass serpent had the form of a real serpent, but it did not have any serpentine poison. The Lord told Moses to lift up this brass serpent on a pole and have the serpent-bitten children of Israel look at it. Whoever looked upon this brass serpent that was judged in place of the children of Israel could live.<p>This incident in Numbers 21 was sovereignly prepared by God to reveal a particular type of Christ. The brass serpent lifted up on a pole in Numbers 21 is a type of Christ lifted up on the cross for us as the Son of Man according to John 3:14. As descendants of Adam, we all have been &#8220;bitten&#8221; by the old serpent, the Devil. Therefore, we are all serpentine beings with the poison of the old serpent in our nature. In the sight of God, the entire fallen human race consists of poisonous serpents. Furthermore, all these serpents are dead. We as dead serpents need a substitute, someone with the form of a serpent but without the poisonous element of the serpent. This substitute, of course, is Christ.<p>According to Romans 8:3, God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh. This corresponds to the revelation in John 3 concerning the brass serpent. For God to send His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin means that Christ became a serpent in form, that is, a brass serpent without the serpentine poison. Furthermore, Paul&#8217;s word in Romans 8:3 about God condemning sin in the flesh indicates that the old serpent has been condemned so that the problem of sin may be solved. Now whoever believes in Christ as the One who was lifted up to be condemned in our place has eternal life. This is the significance of the type of the brass serpent in John 3:14.<p>In his conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord spoke to him concerning the brass serpent. The Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;Nicodemus, you ask me how it is possible to be born again. You are a teacher of Israel. You have taught the people from the five books written by Moses. Did you never tell them about the story in Numbers 21? Certainly you must have taught this. Don&#8217;t you know that the matter of the brass serpent in Numbers 21 is related to regeneration? As Moses lifted up the brass serpent on the pole, so the Son of Man must be lifted up.&#8221; The Lord was indicating to Nicodemus that He was the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent.<p>It was as the Son of Man that Christ was lifted up on the cross to be judged in our behalf. This means that He was lifted up not as the Creator, but as a creature, even as a creature that was in the form of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Some teachers may deny the fact that Christ with respect to His humanity is a creature. But the Bible clearly reveals that Christ became a creature, and even a creature in the form of the flesh of sin, for He took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin. In typology, this is signified by the brass serpent. According to the type of the brass serpent, when Christ was lifted up on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form of the brass serpent, but He did not have the nature of sin typified by the poisonous nature of the serpent.<p>Certain opposers have spread the evil rumor that I teach that Christ had a sinful nature. I have never taught that the Lord Jesus had a sinful nature. However, according to Numbers 21, John 3:14, Romans 8:3, and 2 Corinthians 5:21, I do teach that the Lord Jesus became flesh in the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin, but not having the nature of sin. According to the Bible, I teach that Christ was made sin for us; that is, He took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin and died upon the cross in that flesh.<h2 class=head1>A SIGN OF OUR SERPENTINE NATURE</h2><p>The point we are emphasizing here is that the brass serpent in 3:14 is a sign not only to Nicodemus, but to us all. In John 3 the Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, &#8220;Nicodemus, you are a serpent. Don&#8217;t think of yourself as a gentleman, and don&#8217;t expect to be changed or improved through teachings. Moses taught you many things, but that did not change the fact that you are a serpent. Now you come to Me, regarding Me as a rabbi and thinking that I may give you some better teachings so you may be improved. No, Nicodemus, you are wrong. You are a serpent. Nicodemus, I am not your rabbi; I am your substitute. You are a poisonous serpent, but I am a &#8216;brass serpent&#8217; willing to be judged by God in your place so that you may have eternal life. If you believe in Me as the One judged by God in your place, My divine life will be released into you. After this divine life has been imparted to you, you will be made alive. Nicodemus, you are dead. What you need is eternal life to enliven you. You don&#8217;t need teachings, and you don&#8217;t need a rabbi. You need a substitute to be judged by God in your place. As this substitute, I have the life within Me to release into your being to make you living.&#8221; This is the sign of the brass serpent.<p>In our preaching of the gospel, we need to declare the truth of 3:14. The Lord&#8217;s word to Nicodemus here is part of the gospel. However, there are many believers who do not understand what the Lord Jesus is saying here. Certainly those in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are no longer ignorant of the significance of the type of the brass serpent and the Lord&#8217;s word concerning it in 3:14. I believe that even the young people are able to understand what I am saying about the sign of the brass serpent.<p>We all must realize that, in the sight of God, we are serpents full of the poison of the Devil, the old serpent. As the offspring of Satan (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33), we are little serpents brought forth by the old serpent. Perhaps you think of yourself as a refined lady or gentleman. But God sees you as a serpent. I must tell you the truth and point out that in the sight of God we, as fallen beings, are all serpents. You may be highly educated, and you may have a gentle disposition and an excellent character. Nevertheless, your sinful nature is serpentine in the eyes of God. Do not think that criminals are serpentine but that you are not. It is a fact that we all are serpentine, for we all have been bitten by that poisonous old serpent.<p>Because we all are serpentine, what we need is not the teachings of a philosopher or a rabbi. We need a &#8220;brass serpent&#8221; to be our substitute to bear God&#8217;s judgment for us, to redeem us, and to release His saving, divine life into our inner being.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING ANOTHER LIFE</h2><p>The sign of regeneration indicates that we need to become a new being. This is the main significance of the first sign in John 3. The second sign, that of the brass serpent, indicates that our old being is serpentine and that this serpentine being must be replaced so that we may receive another life, eternal life, in order to become a new being with a new life and a new nature.<p>Let us consider the Lord&#8217;s word in 3:14 and 15: &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;that&#8221; at the beginning of verse 15 is better translated &#8220;so that&#8221; or &#8220;in order that.&#8221; This indicates the goal of the lifting up of the Son of Man. The Son of Man was lifted up in order that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. Therefore, the goal of the lifting up of the Lord Jesus as a &#8220;brass serpent&#8221; is that everyone who believes in Him may receive another life, eternal life, divine life.<p>We should not separate or divide verse 16 from verse 15. The word &#8220;for&#8221; at the beginning of verse 16 indicates that it is a word of explanation. Why did the Lord Jesus become a &#8220;brass serpent&#8221; to be lifted up on the cross for us so that we may have eternal life? The answer, revealed in verse 16, is that it was because God loves the human race. According to 3:16, &#8220;God so loved the world.&#8221; The &#8220;world&#8221; here does not refer to the globe; it denotes the human race. The human race is called the world because it has become a part of the system of Satan. (The Greek word for &#8220;world,&#8221; kosmos, means a system.) The fallen human race has become a part of Satan&#8217;s world system. Nevertheless, God loves the satanic human race; in this sense He loves the world.<p>The entire satanic, human world has become serpentine. Everyone in it, including philosophers such as Confucius and Plato, is serpentine. Of course, we also are serpentine. Nevertheless, God loves us and He gave His Son to become a &#8220;brass serpent&#8221; judged on the cross in our stead. The result is that everyone who believes in Him does not perish but has eternal life. In verse 16 also the word &#8220;that&#8221; means &#8220;in order that.&#8221;<p>The sign of the brass serpent indicates that Christ was lifted up for us and judged by God so that by believing in Him as our substitute we may have eternal life. Hallelujah for the sign of the brass serpent!<h2 class=head1>THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>The third sign in John 3 is that of the bride. How marvelous that this chapter takes us from a serpent to a bride! John 3:29 says, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; All believers, brothers and sisters alike, are part of this bride. I am very happy to be included in this bride.<p>John 21:25 says, &#8220;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written.&#8221; This verse, together with 20:30-31, affirms that this Gospel is the record of a selection of things that serve a particular purpose. Certain things that Jesus did are recorded in this Gospel as signs. We have seen that in chapter three there are three signs-regeneration, the brass serpent, and the bride. It is significant that there is no mention of the bride in chapter two, and no mention in chapter three of the changing of water into wine.<p>According to 3:26, the disciples of John the Baptist said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.&#8221; This indicates that the disciples of John the Baptist were jealous because many of his followers were turning to the Lord Jesus. But John said to them, &#8220;You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom&#8221; (vv. 28-29). By this we see that it was John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, who spoke in 3:29 concerning the bride and the bridegroom.<p>John&#8217;s brief word concerning the bride is very significant. It indicates that all regenerated persons are components of the bride who will be married to the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom. How marvelous! Why do we, serpentine beings, need to be replaced and regenerated to have another life? It is correct to say that the goal is that we may enter into the kingdom of God and become members of the Body of Christ. However, according to the context of the whole chapter, regeneration issues in the bride of Christ.<p>Have you ever realized that you have been regenerated in order to become a part of Christ&#8217;s bride? Perhaps some would argue and say, &#8220;When the Lord Jesus speaks about regeneration in this chapter, He doesn&#8217;t indicate that we are regenerated in order to become part of the bride. Instead, He tells us that we must be regenerated so that we may enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221; Let us not isolate verses 1 through 8 from the chapter as a whole. We should not separate the Lord&#8217;s word concerning regeneration from what is written in this chapter regarding the brass serpent and the bride. Only when we put these three matters together can we have a complete understanding of what this chapter reveals.<p>We need to see that regeneration means that our serpentine being is put aside and that we receive the divine life in order to become a new being so that we may be a part of the bride. By this we see that regeneration is for producing the bride of Christ. Have you been regenerated? Are you a regenerated person? What is the goal of your regeneration? If you see the vision revealed in this chapter, your thinking will be revolutionized and you will be able to declare that you have been regenerated so that you may become part of Christ&#8217;s bride. You will say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, hallelujah! I am part of Your bride, Your counterpart. Lord, how sweet and pleasant it is that I am part of Your heart&#8217;s love and desire!&#8221; We all are part of the bride of Christ. We all need to realize that through regeneration we have been made part of the bride of Christ. We all can declare, &#8220;Through regeneration I have become a part of the bride of Christ!&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-16</h1><p>At the beginning of this message I would call your attention to John 3:16, a very familiar verse to us all: &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&#8221; Please notice that this verse begins with the little word &#8220;for.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;for&#8221; here, gar, is often used in a very significant way, especially in the writings of Paul. Paul&#8217;s Epistles show that he was a very logical and reasonable person. Often he uses the word &#8220;for&#8221; to explain his thought. For example, in Romans 8:1-27, twelve verses begin with this word.<p>The use of the word &#8220;for&#8221; at the beginning of John 3:16 indicates that this is not an isolated verse. On the contrary, this is a verse that depends upon the foregoing word. Based upon what is covered in 3:1-15, verse 16 explains, &#8220;For God so loved the world....&#8221;<h2 class=head1>GRACE AND GIFT</h2><p>Before considering this matter further, I would like to speak concerning grace. Grace refers to a gift, to something given free of charge. If you were to give someone a free gift, that gift may be regarded as grace. The Greek word for grace, charis, may be rendered either grace or gift. A gift is always a grace. According to the common understanding among Christians, grace denotes unmerited favor.<p>The Gospel of John uses the word grace in a very emphatic way. John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace. Then in 1:16 and 17 John goes on to say, &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&#8221; The law is lifeless; hence, it was given. Grace, however, is a person; hence, we are told that grace came. Students of the Bible know that the law is a great matter, but grace is an even greater matter. We may say that the Bible teaches two main things: the law of the old dispensation and the grace of the new dispensation. No other book in the New Testament emphasizes grace in the way the Gospel of John does. If we would know what grace is, we need to come to this Gospel, a Gospel that emphasizes grace to the uttermost, and inquire of the Apostle John what he means by grace.<p>In chapter three of John we have a definition of grace, even though the word grace is not used in this chapter. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten Son. We are not told here that God gave us some kind of unmerited favor; we are told that He gave us a Person, His Son. This Person whom God gave is the gift, and this gift is grace.<p>In John 3 we have a link that connects this chapter with John 1. In chapter one of John we have grace, and in chapter three we have God&#8217;s gift. Grace is the giving, and this giving is grace.<h2 class=head1>A COMPLETE SECTION</h2><p>We have seen that 3:16 begins with &#8220;for&#8221; and that this indicates that here we have an explanation of the foregoing word. Therefore, we need to consider what verse 15 says. Here we are told &#8220;that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.&#8221; The word &#8220;that&#8221; at the beginning of verse 15 indicates that this verse also is a continuation of the preceding word. Both verse 15 and verse 16 end with the words &#8220;eternal life.&#8221; This is a further indication that verse 16 is an explanation of verse 15. However, the fact that verse 15 begins with &#8220;that&#8221; indicates that this verse also is a continuation. Therefore, in order to understand verse 15, we must read verse 14.<p>John 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Notice that this verse begins with &#8220;and.&#8221; This is an indication that verse 14 does not stand by itself. If we read verses 14 and 15 together, we shall see that the Son of Man was lifted up so that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life. This proves that the lifting up of the Son of Man issues in eternal life. If the Son of Man had not been lifted up in the form of a brass serpent, it would not be possible for eternal life to be given to anyone. But because Christ has been lifted up as the brass serpent, we may now receive eternal life by believing in Him.<p>We have pointed out that because verse 14 begins with &#8220;and,&#8221; this verse does not stand alone. It is the continuation of verse 13. But verse 13 also begins with &#8220;and,&#8221; and verse 12 begins with &#8220;if.&#8221; This makes it necessary for us to go back to verse 11: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus does not say &#8220;I speak&#8221;; He says &#8220;we speak.&#8221; Who is this &#8220;we&#8221;? This refers to John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus. If we read chapters one and three of John, we shall see that John the Baptist came before the Lord Jesus came. According to Matthew 3:11, John the Baptist said to the Pharisees and Sadducees, &#8220;I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&#8221; According to John 1:33, John the Baptist said, &#8220;He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Therefore, John made it clear that He had come to baptize in water, but the One who was coming would baptize His believers in the Spirit. John seemed to be saying, &#8220;The One who is greater than I, He who is coming after me, will baptize you in the Spirit. Because you are sinful, I baptize you in water unto repentance. The purpose of my baptism is to bury you. You are good only for burying. I call upon you to repent. Do you really mean business to repent? Do you know what it means to repent? To repent is to realize that you are sinful and good for nothing except death and burial. If you truly desire to repent, then let me bury you in water. The only thing I can do is terminate you by burying you. I cannot give you life. But death brings in resurrection. After I bury you in water, the One who is coming after me will raise you up and put you into the Spirit. Then you will become a new creation, a new race.&#8221; Do you know what this is? This is regeneration.<p>Verses 1 through 16 of John 3 are a complete section. This means that verse 16 is the conclusion of this section. However, for centuries Christians have paid attention to this conclusion as if it were something separate from the foregoing verses. Of course, many have paid attention to the matter of regeneration. Nevertheless, there is still the need for us to see the whole picture presented in these sixteen verses.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S CONVERSATION WITH NICODEMUS</h2><p>Verses 1 and 2 say, &#8220;But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: he came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.&#8221; Here we see that Nicodemus was a Pharisee. In his day there were certain qualifications to be a Pharisee. Not only was Nicodemus a Pharisee; he was also a ruler of the Jews. Why did such a person come to the Lord Jesus by night? It was because of pride that Nicodemus came to Him at night. He was a Pharisee with a high position in society. Furthermore, according to 3:10, he was a teacher of Israel. In addition, Nicodemus was an elderly man and a gentleman. We may say that he was a Pharisee, a ruler, a teacher, an elderly man, and a gentleman.<p>It is possible that at that time Nicodemus was more than sixty years old. The Lord Jesus was probably only a little over thirty. Nicodemus was at least one generation older than the Lord Jesus. Yet he came to a young man from Nazareth to be taught by Him. Nicodemus knew that if he were seen talking to the Lord Jesus, he might be condemned and put to shame by the other Pharisees. This was the reason he came to the Lord by night.<p>When Nicodemus came to the Lord, he called Him a rabbi, an honorable title that denotes a teacher. Nicodemus also said that no one could do the signs that the Lord was doing unless God was with him. It is significant that Nicodemus had such a recognition of Jesus, the Nazarene. Because Nicodemus knew that God was with this Nazarene, he was willing to come to Him to receive His teaching.<p>According to 3:3, the Lord answered Nicodemus, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221; Here the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;The fact that you call Me a rabbi indicates that you want to receive more teachings, more doctrines. But I have not come that you may have doctrine. Nicodemus, I have come that you may have life and that you may have it abundantly. I have come to impart life to you. I&#8217;m not here as a rabbi to give you more teachings. Nicodemus, I am not your rabbi-I am your life-giver. Even I want to be your life. I want to give Myself to you as life. What you need is to be born anew. Unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God, much less enter into it. Nicodemus, you are now in man&#8217;s kingdom. But there is another kingdom, another realm, and this is God&#8217;s realm. How can you, a human being, know the things in God&#8217;s realm? If you would know the things in this realm, you need to have God&#8217;s life. Therefore, if you would see the kingdom of God and enter into it, you must be born again.&#8221;<p>Every kingdom has a particular kind of life. The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have animal life. In the same principle, human beings in the human kingdom have a human life. From the Lord&#8217;s word to Nicodemus we see that we need another life, the divine life, God&#8217;s life, if we would know the things of the divine kingdom.<p>When the Lord told him of the necessity to be born anew, Nicodemus said to Him, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born, can he?&#8221; (v. 4). This indicates that Nicodemus thought that to be born again required that a person enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born. This was his understanding of the Lord&#8217;s word.<p>In verse 5 the Lord Jesus went on to say to him, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221; Notice that the Lord did not explain to Nicodemus what it means to be born of water and the Spirit; neither did Nicodemus ask about this. This indicates that Nicodemus understood the Lord&#8217;s word about being born of water and the Spirit. As we have already mentioned, Nicodemus must have known the word of John the Baptist. John the Baptist had said that he baptized in water but that the One coming after him would baptize in the Spirit. Therefore, we need two kinds of baptism-a baptism in water and a baptism in the Spirit.<p>In verses 6 through 8 the Lord continued by saying that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Then he told Nicodemus not to marvel that He said to him, &#8220;You must be born anew.&#8221; Then in verse 8 the Lord said, &#8220;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is every one who is born of the Spirit.&#8221;<p>According to verse 9, Nicodemus said to the Lord, &#8220;How can these things be?&#8221; This indicates that he understood what the Lord was talking about and that now he wanted to know how these things could be.<p>The Lord answered, &#8220;You are the teacher of Israel, and you don&#8217;t know these things?&#8221; (v. 10). Here and in the following verses the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;Nicodemus, as the teacher of Israel, have you never taught from chapter twenty-one of Numbers? You know from that chapter that the children of Israel were rebellious, and they were bitten by serpents. Many of the people died. When the children of Israel cried out to Moses about the situation, Moses prayed to the Lord in their behalf. God told Moses to make a brass serpent and lift it up on a pole. He also said that anyone who was bitten by a poisonous serpent should look at the brass serpent on the pole, and whoever looked at that serpent would live. Most of the children of Israel did this, and in this way they did not die. Nicodemus, as one who has been a teacher for years, you must know this story.&#8221;<p>In verse 11 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.&#8221; In this verse the pronouns &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus.<p>In verse 12 the Lord continued, &#8220;If I told you of things on earth and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you of things in heaven?&#8221; The things on earth here do not refer to things of an earthly nature, but things that take place on earth, including redemption and regeneration. Regeneration is not something that occurs in heaven, but something that happens on earth. In the same principle, the &#8220;things in heaven&#8221; in this verse are not things of a heavenly nature, but things which take place in heaven. Hence, in the following verse, the Lord said that He is the One who descended out of heaven and who is still in heaven. This indicates that He knows the things which take place in heaven because He is the One who is in heaven all the time.<p>As we have seen, verses 14 and 15 say that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life. Then verse 16 explains that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son in order that those who believe in Him should not perish but have eternal life.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ENJOY THE INCARNATED GOD</h2><p>Chapter one of the Gospel of John reveals that Christ came as the tabernacle (1:14), and that tabernacle was actually the incarnated God into whom the believers may enter. But what is the entrance, the way, into the tabernacle? The entrance is Christ as the offerings. Therefore, after the tabernacle in 1:14, we have the Lamb of God in 1:29. This Lamb signifies Christ as all the offerings. It is by these offerings that we may enter into the tabernacle. Therefore, in chapter one we have the tabernacle and the offerings as the way to enter into this tabernacle, the incarnated God.<p>In John 1 we see that God came in incarnation to be the tabernacle and also came as the offerings for us to enjoy. If we would enjoy Him and partake of Him as the offerings, we may enter into Him as the tabernacle.<p>In chapters three through eleven of John we have a number of cases as illustrations. The first case is that of Nicodemus. According to John 3, Nicodemus, a Pharisee, a ruler, a teacher, an elderly man, a gentleman, and a man seeking God, came to the One who is the tabernacle and the offerings. The One whom Nicodemus contacted that night was the incarnated God to be received by us so that we may enter into Him. Moreover, this One was also all the offerings. How could Nicodemus, a needy one, partake of this incarnated God? How could he enjoy God and enter into God? Who is able to answer this question? Was it answered by the ancient philosophers in Greece, Babylon, and Egypt? Certainly not. Neither was it answered by Confucius. But the Bible reveals the answer to this most difficult question. According to what is portrayed in John 3, Nicodemus needed the incarnated God to be his offerings. In order to understand this, we need the types of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament, and we also need the cases in the New Testament.<p>When Nicodemus referred to the Lord Jesus as a teacher sent from God, the Lord told him that he needed to be born again. Then He went on to help Nicodemus to be clear concerning this. Nicodemus asked, &#8220;How can these things be?&#8221; He seemed to be saying, &#8220;Now I understand what it means to be born again. But how can this be?&#8221; In answer to Nicodemus&#8217; question, the Lord compared Himself to the brass serpent lifted up on the pole: &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be telling him, &#8220;I have come to be a brass serpent, and one day I shall be lifted up on the cross. Nicodemus, this indicates that no matter how good, gentle, and qualified you may be, you must realize that you have a serpentine nature. Do not think that those who commit gross sins are serpentine and that you are not. Nicodemus, you have a serpentine nature. In your forefather and ancestor Adam, you were bitten by the old serpent. When Adam was bitten by the serpent, you also were bitten. Because you were born of Adam, you inherited his serpentine nature. Outwardly, you do not appear to be serpentine. Rather, you are a gentleman. But inwardly, according to your nature, you are serpentine. Therefore, it is necessary that I die for you. Just as the brass serpent was lifted up by Moses, I need to be lifted up on the cross and judged by God for you. Nicodemus, you have been teaching the children of Israel for years. Have you never taught them the story about the serpents in Numbers 21? You need to realize, Nicodemus, that you are serpentine and that I must die for you as your substitute. You have the serpentine poison, but I am merely a brass serpent. I have the form of a serpent, but not the poisonous nature of a serpent. Although I am sinless, God has made Me to be sin for you (2 Cor. 5:21). I do not know sin, but God sent Me in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), in the form of a brass serpent.&#8221;<p>Christians today appreciate John 3:16 very much, but not many of them understand 3:14. However, 3:16 is the issue of 3:14; that is, the receiving of eternal life is the issue of the uplifting of the brass serpent. The Lord was telling Nicodemus that if he realized that he was serpentine and believed in the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent lifted up as his substitute, he would have eternal life. This is to be regenerated, to receive another life, the divine life. When the divine life came into us, we received another life. To have this new life is what it means to be born again.<p>In chapters one and three of John we see the way to enjoy the incarnated God. Genesis 1 reveals that God is the Creator. But in John 1 and 3 God is not merely the Creator; He has become incarnated to be the tabernacle into which we may enter. Furthermore, this incarnated God is all the offerings. He became flesh in order to be the tabernacle and the offerings. If the Lord had not become flesh, how could He have been the Lamb with blood to shed for our redemption? Apart from His incarnation, He would not have had the blood to shed for us. But because He became flesh, on the one hand, He became the tabernacle for us to enter and, on the other hand, He became the offerings that qualify us to enter into Him.<h2 class=head1>PARTAKING OF CHRIST</h2><p>Today Christ still presents Himself to us as the tabernacle and the offerings. But how can we partake of Him? In order to partake of Him, we must realize that we have a serpentine nature. Sin is the poison of the serpent, the Devil, Satan. Through Adam this sinful nature was put into us, and now we have the serpentine poison in our nature. In order to enjoy the incarnated God, we must realize that we are such serpentine beings. We must also realize that Christ was made sin for us and died on the cross as a brass serpent so that the serpentine nature within us might be judged. If we realize that we are sinful people, serpentine beings, and confess this, immediately this dear, incarnated One will become our sin offering and enter into us. Then we shall have Him as eternal life. This is the way for us to partake of the incarnated God for our enjoyment. It is when we admit that we are serpentine that we are qualified to experience eternal life and enjoy Him.<p>This is not a once-for-all matter. On the contrary, it should be a daily experience. John the Baptist preached repentance, and in the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord Jesus again and again tells us to repent. This indicates that throughout our entire Christian life we need to repent. Daily we need to say, &#8220;Lord, I am serpentine. But I thank You, Lord, that You became the brass serpent lifted up to be judged in my place. Lord, I confess that I am sinful. Even though You did not know sin, You were made sin for me, and You died on the cross to condemn sin. Now, Lord, I take You as my sin offering.&#8221; Whenever we do this, He once again becomes our enjoyment.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36</h1><p>The title of this message is &#8220;The Serpent and the Bride.&#8221; It may seem strange to put these two matters together. How can the serpent go together with the bride? What does such a title mean? This title is absolutely not related to anything religious or ethical. It is very common, of course, to speak of a bridegroom and a bride. But who would link together the serpent and the bride? Nevertheless, chapter three of John speaks of both the serpent and the bride. We all know that in this chapter we have Nicodemus, the matter of regeneration by the Spirit, and the &#8220;golden&#8221; verse, John 3:16. However, I wonder how many Christians have paid adequate attention to the words &#8220;serpent&#8221; and &#8220;bride&#8221; found in verses 14 and 29.<h2 class=head1>THE BRASS SERPENT</h2><p>John 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; The Lord seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;You are a teacher of Israel, and surely you must have taught the story in Numbers 21. According to that chapter, the children of Israel were bitten by serpents. The serpentine nature got into them. In the sight of God, they all became serpentine. As they were dying from the poison of the serpent, they cried out to Moses, and he prayed to God for them. God told Moses to make a serpent of brass and lift it up upon a pole.&#8221; In the Old Testament, to be lifted up in such a way denotes judgment by God and before God. Hence, for the brass serpent to be lifted up on a pole indicates that it was judged by God. We know from Numbers 21:9 that &#8220;it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.&#8221;<p>The brass serpent was the same as a real serpent in form but not in nature. It had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. The brass serpent was a substitute for all the children of Israel who had been bitten by the fiery serpents and who had become serpentine. Therefore, all the children of Israel were judged by God when their substitute, the brass serpent, was lifted up on the pole and judged by Him. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, whoever looked upon that brass serpent was made alive. The Bible does not say that the children of Israel were healed by looking at the brass serpent; it says that they were made alive. In the sight of God, they were not sick; they were dead. This was the reason they became alive by looking at the uplifted brass serpent.<p>In 3:14 the Lord pointed out to Nicodemus, an elderly religionist who taught the Bible to God&#8217;s people, that as the brass serpent was lifted up in the wilderness for the children of Israel who had been bitten by the serpent, so He, the Son of Man, would be lifted up in order that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life. Verse 15 is the completion of verse 14: &#8220;That every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.&#8221; The word &#8220;that&#8221; at the beginning of verse 14 indicates that the result of the Lord&#8217;s being lifted up as the Son of Man is eternal life for every one who believes. Verse 16 begins with the word &#8220;for.&#8221; This indicates that 3:16 is an explanation of verses 14 and 15. It explains the fact that, in the sight of God, the Lord Jesus was lifted up as our Substitute to bear God&#8217;s judgment for us so that we may look at Him and receive eternal life. Because in Adam we were bitten by the old serpent, we were dead. But now through Christ as the brass serpent lifted up on the cross, we may receive eternal life, the life of God.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF REGENERATION</h2><p>The serpent is mentioned in John 3 in such a way as to indicate that we, fallen human beings, are all serpentine. We are not only sinners; we are serpentine because we were bitten by the old serpent. To be sure, when Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus that night, he certainly did not have any realization that he was serpentine. He probably regarded himself as a God-seeking and God-fearing man, as a man who tried to please God by keeping the law of God and who taught the Scriptures to the children of Israel. Nicodemus, however, was not satisfied with the law or with the teachings in the Old Testament. He had heard about Jesus the Nazarene and what signs He had done. Nicodemus may have seen some of these signs, and he may also have heard the Lord speak. But he did not dare to come to Him directly, because that would have been a shame for a man of his position. This was the reason Nicodemus came to the Lord at night.<p>We know that Nicodemus respected the Lord Jesus by the way he spoke to Him in verse 2. Nicodemus said, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.&#8221; Among the Jews, rabbi was the highest title that could be given to anyone. Not only did Nicodemus call the Lord a rabbi; he also recognized that He came from God. He knew that as God had sent Moses to the fathers, so He had sent the Lord Jesus to them. Nicodemus seemed to be saying, &#8220;The other Pharisees may not respect you, but I do. I respect you as a rabbi sent to us by God. Surely you can give me some better teachings. As a teacher of the Scriptures, I want to receive more teachings, better teachings, higher teachings.&#8221; However, the Lord Jesus answered Nicodemus not with teachings, but with a clear word about being born again: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; (v. 3). Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be telling Nicodemus, &#8220;You come to Me for teachings. But you do not need more teaching-you need to be born again. Nicodemus, you need another birth.&#8221;<p>In speaking with Nicodemus, the Lord Jesus was wise. He did not tell him frankly and directly that he was serpentine. The Lord did not say, &#8220;Nicodemus, because you are serpentine, you need to be born again.&#8221; First the Lord told Nicodemus that he needed to be born again. Only later did He bring in the matter of the brass serpent.<p>In the conversation between Nicodemus and the Lord Jesus there were two sides, the side of Nicodemus and the side of the Lord. As an elderly man, Nicodemus was religious, ethical, and moral. What he said to the Lord here is natural, religious, moral, ethical, and human.<p>The Lord&#8217;s way of speaking to Nicodemus was not religious, ethical, moral, or human. The Lord told him that it was necessary for him to be born anew. Moses did not teach this. Neither was it taught by Confucius or the Greek philosophers. This word is something beyond religion, ethics, morality, and philosophy.<p>No doubt, the Lord&#8217;s word about being born anew was puzzling to such a religious and ethical person as the elderly Nicodemus. Nicodemus said to the Lord, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born, can he?&#8221; (v. 4). Although the Lord&#8217;s word about being born anew was something beyond human thought, the question Nicodemus asked in verse 4 indicates that he brought the Lord&#8217;s word down to the human level. He thought that to be born anew required a return to the mother&#8217;s womb to be born a second time. But even if such a thing were possible, we would still have our serpentine nature. Being reborn physically would do nothing to change this. As the Lord says in verse 6, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh.&#8221; Here the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;Even if you could go back again and again to your mother&#8217;s womb to be born, you would still be flesh.&#8221; In the sight of God, this flesh contains the poison of the old serpent. Our flesh is altogether serpentine.<p>The Lord was patient with Nicodemus and went on to say in verse 5, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221; We have seen that water is the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate those of the old creation. Spirit is the central concept of the ministry of the Lord Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. These two main concepts put together are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration. Regeneration is the termination of those of the old creation with all their deeds and their germination in the new creation with the divine life.<p>In 3:5 the Lord was saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;You need to be buried in the water spoken of by John the Baptist in his ministry. John did not come to teach you how to keep the law of Moses; he came to bury you. Do you know why John wanted to bury you? It is because you are dead, you are a corpse, and a corpse needs to be buried. John the Baptist said that he would immerse you in water and bury you there, but that after him another One would come to baptize you with the Spirit. The water is for burying you, and the Spirit is for raising you up. John came to bury you in water, and I came to raise you up so that you may be a new person, a person resurrected by the Spirit of life.&#8221;<p>It seems that Nicodemus understood the Lord&#8217;s word at least to a certain extent. Therefore he went on to ask in verse 9, &#8220;How can these things be?&#8221; In answer to Nicodemus&#8217; question, the Lord said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up. The Lord went on to say that whoever believes in Him as the uplifted Son of Man will receive eternal life. Then He explained that this is the real manifestation of God&#8217;s love to the world.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word to Nicodemus in verses 14 and 15 implied that for Nicodemus to be regenerated, to be born anew, he would need to realize that he was serpentine. The Lord seemed to be telling him, &#8220;Nicodemus, you are one of those who have been bitten by the serpent, just as the children of Israel were bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness. Therefore, you should not regard yourself as good. You need to see that you are serpentine. In the sight of God, Nicodemus, you are a serpent, one of the offspring of that old serpent in Genesis 3. You need Me to be your Substitute, to be the brass serpent judged by God so that you may be redeemed and have the ground to believe in Me to receive the divine life, in order that you may be reborn to become another person, a new man.&#8221;<p>According to 3:14, Christ became a brass serpent. Once again I say that He was a serpent in form, but He did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. We, however, actually are serpentine, for in our fallen nature we are children of the old serpent, the Devil (1 John 3:10). For this reason, in Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees a &#8220;brood of vipers.&#8221; In Matthew 23:33 He called them &#8220;serpents, brood of vipers,&#8221; the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents. The Lord was telling the Pharisees that they were little vipers. Furthermore in John 8:44 He said, &#8220;You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it.&#8221; Because the Devil is the father of sinners, sinners are children of the Devil. The Devil is the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), and sinners also are serpents, the offspring of vipers. Therefore, in the sight of God, in our fallen nature we are not merely sinful-we are serpentine.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</h2><p>In chapter three of John we not only have the serpent; we also have the bride. In verse 29 John the Baptist said, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; Who is this bride? The bride is the composition, the aggregate, of all the regenerated ones. The totality of all those who have been regenerated is the bride of Christ. We all are part of Christ&#8217;s bride, and this bride is His increase (3:30).<p>In 3:26 the disciples of John the Baptist came to him and said, &#8220;Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.&#8221; John&#8217;s disciples were made jealous by the fact that so many of his followers were coming to the Lord Jesus. As part of his answer to his disciples, John the Baptist said concerning Christ, &#8220;He must increase, but I must decrease&#8221; (v. 30). The increase in this verse is the bride in the previous verse, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated ones. This means that in this chapter regeneration is not only to bring the divine life into the believers, but is also to make them the corporate bride for Christ&#8217;s increase. As Adam was increased in Eve, so Christ is increased in His bride.<p>Some Christian teachers understand verse 30 in a natural, human way. They think that John the Baptist&#8217;s word means that Christ must be everything and that we should be nothing. This interpretation is incorrect. As we have indicated, the increase in verse 30 refers to the bride in verse 29. By being the brass serpent bearing God&#8217;s judgment, Christ has opened the way for us to believe in Him and receive Him that we may be regenerated to become His increase. As those who believe in Christ, we are all members of His Body. This is Christ&#8217;s increase. When Christ was on earth, He was the individual Christ. Now there is the corporate Christ, and this corporate Christ is the increase of the individual Christ. This corporate Christ is the church, the Body, the bride. Therefore, in John 3 we can clearly see the serpent and the bride.<p>In 3:31-36 we have a very high revelation of Christ. These verses speak of the immeasurable Christ, the One who comes from above and who is above all, who speaks the words of God and gives the Spirit without measure, and the One to whom the Father has given all things. This is the universal Christ, the immeasurable Christ.<p>The intention of this chapter in the Gospel of John is to show us that this unlimited Christ must have a universal increase, and He is in the process of gaining this increase today. Wherever we go, Christ is present by the Spirit He gives without measure. Verse 34 says definitely, &#8220;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; This is the Spirit He gives to His Body, the church. The Spirit given by Christ to His Body is immeasurable. Every one of the millions of persons who believes in the Lord Jesus has received the Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit. This immeasurable Spirit produces a universal increase for the unlimited Christ. I would call your attention to the three adjectives used in the previous sentence: immeasurable, universal, unlimited. I use the word immeasurable to describe the Spirit, the word universal to describe the increase, and the word unlimited to describe Christ. The unlimited Christ gives the immeasurable Spirit in order to produce a universal increase.<p>Christ and His bride, His increase, form a universal couple. In the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we see this couple. The Lamb, Christ, is the husband, and the New Jerusalem is the bride. In John 3 we have the serpent and the bride. Ultimately, in the book of Revelation we see that Satan as the old serpent will be entirely dealt with (Rev. 20:2, 10) and that the bride of Christ as the New Jerusalem will be brought forth in full (Rev. 21:2, 10-27).<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36</h1><p>It is according to the Scriptures to speak of the serpent and the bride. We may say that, considered as a whole, the Bible unveils to us the matter of the serpent and the bride. Some Christians may say that they have never heard that the Bible tells us about the serpent and the bride. They know that the Bible reveals God the Creator, and it also reveals Christ, our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord. It is, of course, correct to say that the Bible reveals God and Christ. However, this may be a rather superficial understanding of the Bible. It is superficial to see merely that Jesus Christ is our Savior. If we have a deeper understanding of the Word, we shall see that Christ was also a brass serpent (3:14), a serpent in form but without the poisonous nature of a serpent. Actually, it is because Christ became a brass serpent that He could be our Savior. If He had not become such a brass serpent, He could not have been our Savior.<p>John 1:29 speaks of Christ as the Lamb of God. But if we go deeper into the Word, we shall see that the Lamb of God in 1:29 is the brass serpent in 3:14. The Lamb satisfies the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, for the Lamb is pure, perfect, and without blemish. The brass serpent represents us, for we are serpentine people, not lambs. As the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus, He indicated to him that He Himself would be lifted up as the brass serpent to be Nicodemus&#8217; Substitute. Therefore, the Lamb of God satisfies God&#8217;s requirements, and the brass serpent represents us. Because we are serpentine and are not lambs, we need Christ as the brass serpent to be our Substitute. This brass serpent is the real sin offering.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF EVE</h2><p>The story of the Bible is a story of the serpent and the bride. In Genesis 2 we have the bride, and in Genesis 3 we have the serpent. The serpent did not come to contact the man, but he contacted the woman, the bride in Genesis 2. God had indicated that it was not good for Adam to live alone. If Adam had remained alone, nothing could have been produced for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. God needs a people. Without a wife, Adam could not have produced this people. Therefore, God increased Adam with a wife.<p>We know that Eve was not a separate creation, having nothing to do with Adam. Rather, Eve was made from a part of Adam&#8217;s being, from his rib. At first Adam was alone. Then God used Adam&#8217;s rib to bring forth the increase of Adam. The result was a couple to produce a people for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. Eve, therefore, is vital and crucial in fulfilling God&#8217;s purpose.<p>The sisters are very important in the church life. In a sense, the sisters are more vital and necessary for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose than the brothers are. This is the reason the old serpent often comes to visit the sisters. They are his special food.<p>In Genesis 3 the serpent visited the bride and succeeded in capturing her. Then through the woman he also gained the man. But God is greater, higher, and wiser than the serpent. In His judgment upon the serpent, God indicated that the woman would bring forth a seed to bruise the serpent&#8217;s head: &#8220;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&#8221; (Gen. 3:15). Furthermore, there is an indication in Genesis 3:21 that the seed of the woman would not only bruise the head of the serpent, but also become righteousness to the very ones who were poisoned by him: &#8220;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.&#8221; These coats of skins typify Christ as righteousness for fallen man.<h2 class=head1>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING CHRIST&#8217;S INCREASE</h2><p>In the early chapters of Genesis we see the serpent and the bride. If we read through the Bible in this light, we shall be able to see the story of the serpent and the bride in both the Old Testament and in the New. In Matthew 23:33 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees &#8220;serpents, brood of vipers.&#8221; In John 3 the Lord Jesus indicated to Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, that he also was serpentine. When the Lord likened Himself to the brass serpent lifted up on a pole, He seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;In Genesis 3 you all were bitten by the old serpent. Then do you remember when the children of Israel were bitten by serpents in the wilderness, and they cried out to Moses? The Lord told Moses to make a brass serpent and lift it up on a pole. Nicodemus, everyone, including you, has been bitten by the serpent. But as the brass serpent was lifted up on a pole, I shall be lifted up on the cross as your Substitute so that eternal life may be imparted into you. This eternal life will regenerate you and make you a new person to become part of the bride as My increase. In this way, serpentine people can become My increase.&#8221;<p>In Adam, the old serpent gained us for himself by biting us. Do you know what it means for the serpent to bite us? It means that he imparts the poison of his nature into us to make us his increase. Through the fall, the entire human race has become the increase of Satan. Do you know what you were before you were saved? You were a part of Satan&#8217;s increase. No matter what kind of person we were before we were saved, we were all part of the increase of that evil one. When the serpent bit Adam in the garden of Eden, he gained the entire human race, and all of mankind became his increase. No doubt, after he had bitten man in Genesis 3, Satan, the old serpent, was happy. He may have laughed and said to himself, &#8220;I have gained man for myself. The man created by God has now become my increase.&#8221;<p>But the Lord Jesus came to be the brass serpent. This means that He became sin for us. Second Corinthians 5:21 says, &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf.&#8221; Sin came from Satan, entered into man (Rom. 5:12), and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&#8217;s judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3).<p>For years I have taught according to the Bible that the sin which dwells in our flesh is the nature of Satan. However, some claim that it is heretical to teach this. But this certainly is not heretical, for the New Testament reveals that the sin in our flesh is the nature of Satan, the serpent.<p>In order to understand this, we need to put together John 3:14, 2 Corinthians 5:21, and Romans 8:3. Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Just as the brass serpent had the form of a real serpent but not the poisonous nature of a serpent, so Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin. God sent His Son in the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin. The brass serpent had the form of a serpent, and Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin.<p>Actually, the very sin that dwells in our flesh is the serpent, the Devil. It is not only the nature of the Devil; it is the Devil himself. Therefore, as fallen people we all were part of Satan, his increase. Praise the Lord that He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin and was nailed to the cross in the form of a serpent! According to Hebrews 2:14, through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who had the authority of death. This evil one is the serpent.<p>When we put all these verses together, we can realize that when the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, He was the brass serpent. As a result, the old serpent, the Devil, Satan, was destroyed through the death of Christ on the cross.<p>Christ&#8217;s death on the cross opened the way for us sinners to believe in Him and receive Him. Now we can receive His life. It was through His redemption that He imparted Himself into us to make us His increase. In this way we who were once the increase of Satan have become the increase of Christ. In the past we were part of Satan&#8217;s increase, but we praise the Lord that we have become part of the increase of Christ.<h2 class=head1>NO INDEPENDENCE</h2><p>Today there is much talk about independence. It seems that in the twentieth century everybody wants to be independent. Actually, no one is independent. We are either a dependent of Satan or a dependent of Christ. We can never be independent. If we are independent of Christ, we are then dependent on Satan. Hallelujah, through regeneration we have become dependents of Christ! Now we are all part of Christ&#8217;s increase.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S CONCERN</h2><p>We see the story of the serpent and the bride not only in the Gospels, but also in Paul&#8217;s Epistles. Second Corinthians 11:2 and 3 say, &#8220;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ; but I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness and the purity which is toward Christ.&#8221; Paul was concerned that the serpent who had come to bite Eve would come to bite the believers at Corinth. Once again, this is the story of the serpent and the bride.<h2 class=head1>THE FINAL WORD CONCERNING THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>This story continues until we come to the end of the Bible. In the book of Revelation we have the final word concerning the serpent and the bride. In chapter nineteen we see that the bride is ready for the wedding of the Lamb (v. 7). Immediately after the wedding, this universal couple will fight against Satan and his followers, the beast and the false prophet. Then Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, where he will be imprisoned for a thousand years. Following that, Satan will rebel once more and ultimately will be cast into the lake of fire. Then the universe will be thoroughly cleared up, and there will be a new heaven and a new earth. For eternity there will be a universal couple: Christ as the Husband and the church as His bride.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ENTER THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>According to the book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb, is also the tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3). The subject of all these messages is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John. Actually, I am not speaking in this message about the serpent and the bride. Instead, I am speaking about the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in John&#8217;s writings. What is the way to enter into the tabernacle? The way is by taking Christ as the brass serpent. This is the sin offering, and the sin offering is the basic offering for us to be equipped and qualified to enter into the tabernacle.<p>We have pointed out in a foregoing message that we enter the tabernacle by becoming the tabernacle. This means that we ourselves actually are the tabernacle we are entering. If we do not become the tabernacle, we shall not be able to enter into the tabernacle. But how can we become the tabernacle? We become the tabernacle by taking Christ as the brass serpent. This is to take Christ as the offerings and to enjoy Him as the offerings.<p>We have seen that the Lamb of God in John 1:29 is the totality of all the offerings. We have also seen that the brass serpent in 3:14 is the Lamb of God. Therefore, the brass serpent also is the totality of the offerings. When we take this brass serpent we take all the offerings in order that we may become the tabernacle. Then by becoming the tabernacle we are in the tabernacle.<p>We should not think that the apostles will enter into the New Jerusalem. No, they will all be parts of the New Jerusalem. This is proved by the fact that the twelve apostles will be the twelve foundations of the city of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14). This indicates that the apostles are parts of the New Jerusalem. In like manner, we all shall be parts of the New Jerusalem, God&#8217;s tabernacle.<p>Do you know how we may enter the church today? We enter the church by becoming the church. If you are not a part of the church, you cannot enter the church. Now we all are in the church. Suppose we could all be taken away somewhere. Then there would not be a church into which some others might enter. The vital point here is that we enter the church by being the church. Likewise, we enter the tabernacle by being the tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>CONTINUING TO LIVE BY OUR OLD BEING</h2><p>In our actual daily living we may not be a newborn person. We may still be an old person, even perhaps a good, moral, ethical, religious, God-fearing Nicodemus. I say this because we may not live, walk, behave, and have our being in the Spirit. Instead of living by the Spirit, we may live by ethics or religion.<p>Before you were saved, you may have done things that were sinful, perhaps even immoral. Now that you are saved, you would never do those things. You have become a person who is religious, ethical, and moral. Furthermore, you fear the Lord and you seek Him. Nevertheless, all this may be something of yourself. It may not be the living of a reborn person. This does not mean, however, that you have not been reborn. You have been reborn, and you have received another life, the divine life. But the problem is that you do not live by this life.<p>Let me give you an illustration to point out how a newborn person can live by the old life. Many years ago in my hometown, most of the houses did not have electric lights. In our home we used kerosene lamps. From the time I was a child, I learned to take care of these lamps. I learned to clean the chimney, trim the wick, and supply oil. I was accustomed to doing this every day. Then in 1939 we had electric lights installed in our home. All we had to do from that time onward was switch on the lights. However, I was still in the habit of using an oil lamp. Often, out of habit, I would come home late in the evening, go to the oil lamp, and pick up a match to light it. Then my children would laugh at me. Realizing what I was doing, I would throw the match away and go to the light switch. Even though electricity had been installed in our home, I was still in the habit of using an oil lamp. Likewise, even though we have been reborn and have the divine life, we are not in the habit of living by it.<p>According to our natural birth, all of us automatically live by our serpentine being. This is to live according to good and evil. With the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden there was not only the knowledge of evil, but also the knowledge of good. But with the tree of life there is nothing but life. We should not think that morality is a matter of life. Morality is good, but it is not life. Confucius taught many things concerning morality and ethics, but he had nothing to say about the divine life. When I turned to Christ, I turned to Him for life. I realized that I had learned things that were good, but I did not have life. After I was saved, the main subject in my preaching of the gospel to the Chinese people was the matter of eternal life. I told the people, &#8220;Confucius may teach you to be good, but he cannot give you life. Christ is life, and you must come to Him in order to receive life. Whether you are good or bad, you still need life.&#8221;<p>No matter what kind of person we may be, in our natural life we all are serpentine. One person may be very refined and another quite crude, but both are serpentine. Certain snakes may be colorful, and others may be ugly. But regardless of their color, they all are snakes. In the same principle, whether we are good or bad by nature, we are still serpentine. Before we were saved, we lived by our serpentine life. Then after we were saved and became genuine Christians, we became religious, and we tried to live a religious, ethical, moral, and good life. This may be your situation right up until the present.<p>When I consider the situation among Christians today, I often weep inwardly. I may mourn before the Lord and say to Him, &#8220;Lord, I have been ministering to Your saints for years concerning Christ as life. But, Lord, I cannot see many that daily live and have their being in You.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>CHRIST LIVING IN US</h2><p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221; Here Paul is saying that he has been terminated and that now Christ lives in him. If Christ were not the living Spirit, how could He live in us? This would be impossible. Some say that Christ is on the throne and that He is represented in us by the Holy Spirit. However, this is not what the Bible says. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says definitely, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; In Galatians 4:19 Paul says that Christ is being formed in us.<p>I am burdened that we would see that our Creator became our Redeemer to die on the cross for us, and now He is not only our Savior but also our life. As our life, He is now living within us. This should not be only a doctrine or theory to us. We must be able to testify that, in a way that is actual and practical, we have been terminated, crucified, and that now Christ is living in us. We should be able to say, &#8220;It is no longer I who live-Christ lives in me. My living is His living, for I live Him. The Lord is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and now I live by this Spirit. I walk according to the Spirit, not according to religion or ethics. I do not walk according to my knowledge of what is good; I walk according to Christ, a living Person who dwells in me. I have my being in this One. I talk to others not by my old man, but by the living Christ. I live by Christ twenty-four hours a day, not only when I pray or when I come to the church meetings. In a real and practical way, Christ is my life, my person. I live Him, and I am now one spirit with Him. I abide in Him, and He abides in me. Therefore, He and I have one life and one living.&#8221;<p>This is the serpent becoming the bride. It is by this kind of life that the church can be built up. Do you know what the built church is? The built church is the bride. When we live Christ and walk according to the living Spirit, we become the bride and spontaneously we are built up.<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE OLD BEING OR THE NEW BEING</h2><p>I have been in the church life more than fifty years. During all my years in the church, I have been observing the situation of the saints. I have noticed that when the saints come together, they usually talk about good things. However, when most of the saints speak, they speak by the old man, not by their regenerated person, by their new being. This is strong indication that the majority of the saints do not live, walk, and have their being in the Spirit. I know from experience that if we would live Christ and practice being one spirit with the Lord and having our being absolutely in the spirit, our talk would be very limited. When we come together, we would not talk in a natural way. Rather, it would be easy for us to pray, praise the Lord, or testify of what we have experienced of the Lord during the day. However, because we do not live and have our being in the spirit, there is still too much gossip among us. Even when we talk about the Bible, we may not speak in the spirit. This proves that our conversation about the Scriptures may also be in the old man. We need to ask ourselves if we are living Christ or living the old serpent. Are we living a life that causes us to be transformed from the serpent into the bride?<p>Concerning everything we do, we need to ask if we are in the Spirit. Suppose you are listening to a message. You need to inquire of yourself, &#8220;Am I listening to this message in my spirit? Am I taking the riches of this message into my spirit, or am I merely receiving the word as some kind of mental stimulation?&#8221; We need to ask the same kind of question about our study of the Bible. Do you study the Bible by the old man or by the Christ who is living within you? There is a great difference between the two ways of reading the Word. We also need to check with ourselves about the way we write letters. Do you write letters in the spirit or in your natural man? It is very possible that much of our correspondence is done in the natural man, not in our regenerated being. There may be nothing wrong in a letter you write. Nevertheless, it may be written by the natural man, not by the spirit. The same may be true concerning our talk on the telephone. Much of the saints&#8217; talking on the telephone is done by their natural being, not by their reborn being.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO LIVE BY OUR REGENERATED BEING</h2><p>It is important for us to realize that as believers in Christ not only do we have two natures-the old nature and the new nature-but we also have two beings, two persons. Although we have been regenerated and thereby have a new person, most of us continue to live by the old person, even in doing so-called spiritual things. We may even endeavor to live the church life by the old man. This is a serious problem.<p>On other occasions I have told you that in recent years my confession to the Lord has mainly been related to my failure to live Him. Often I have said, &#8220;Lord, forgive me for not living You adequately today. In my family life and in my fellowship with the brothers, I am short of what You require.&#8221; I have seen that I may be religious, ethical, moral, and scriptural-all without Christ. Because the Bible commands us not to steal, we would obey this commandment. However, this may not be the living of Christ. Rather, we may be the one obeying the commandment not to steal. But we all need to be able to say with Paul that we have been crucified and that Christ now lives in us. We should be able to declare this with assurance, not as a doctrine but as our experience day by day. When we have this kind of living, then in reality we are serpentine beings in the process of transformation into the bride of Christ. This is the transformation revealed in the New Testament. As we are transformed from serpentine beings into Christ&#8217;s being, we become His increase, His bride. The consummation of this bride will be the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God and the wife of the Lamb.<p>I urge you to bring this message to the Lord in a serious way and pray, &#8220;Lord, show me by what person I am living. Am I living by my old person or by my new person? Am I living by the old nature or by the new nature? Lord, am I living You? Am I practicing being one spirit with You?&#8221; We all need to pray to the Lord like this. May the Lord have mercy on us that we may learn to live by our regenerated being.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</h1><p>In the previous messages we pointed out that the writings of John are concerned with the divine mysteries. These mysteries include the mystery of the divine Person, the mystery of the divine life, and the mystery of the divine birth. Actually anything that is divine is a mystery to the human mind.<h2 class=head1>NEGLECTING THE MYSTERIES AND FORMING A RELIGION</h2><p>If we neglect the mysteries in the writings of John, we may take what is revealed in the Bible and use it to form a religion. According to the Bible, Christians teach that there is a God and that this God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. They also teach that the human race has become fallen and sinful in the sight of God. According to God&#8217;s righteous law, we all should be judged and perish. Christians teach from the Bible that God loves fallen mankind, that He sent His Son into the world as a man, and that this One died on the cross for our sins. But since He is the Son of God, He could not be held by death. Therefore, He was resurrected, and He has ascended to the heavens, where as the Lord of all He is now sitting at the right hand of God. One day He will come back to set up His kingdom on earth and will reign on earth for a thousand years, a period of time known in Christian teaching as the millennium. Anyone who believes the gospel will receive the forgiveness of sins and will have eternal life. This kind of Bible teaching has been spread throughout the world.<p>Furthermore, Christians are taught to worship God, to do everything for the glory of God, and to bring souls to Christ. They are also taught to gather together to worship God according to certain rituals, forms or ordinances. In none of these teachings can we see the depths of the mysterious things.<p>Christians often talk about eternal life. However, eternal life is usually understood to signify some kind of everlasting blessing. To many Christians, the words &#8220;eternal life&#8221; do not convey the thought of a mysterious, divine life. It is common for Christians to speak of everlasting life rather than eternal life, according to the King James Version. In the concept of many, the term everlasting life denotes a blessing that lasts forever. Such teachings do not touch the mysteries in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE LIFE AND THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2><p>What is revealed in the depths of the Bible is mysterious, such as the divine life and the divine Spirit. Christians speak mainly of four matters related to Christ: Christ in eternity, Christ in the flesh dying to accomplish redemption, Christ in ascension at the right hand of God, and Christ in His coming back. But they miss the crucial matter of the indwelling Christ.<p>The indwelling of Christ involves two mysteries: the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine Spirit. Life and the Spirit are two of the most mysterious matters revealed in the Bible. Today the resurrected Christ is both the divine life and the divine Spirit. Christ in resurrection is the divine life, the life that in the Bible is called eternal life. He is also the divine Spirit, whom the Bible calls the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Eternal life and the life-giving Spirit are very mysterious matters. No other mysteries in the Word can compare with these.<h2 class=head1>A SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING OF FOUR MATTERS</h2><h2 class=head2>Regeneration</h2><p>Many Christians have a superficial realization of at least four matters in John 3: regeneration (vv. 3, 5), the Spirit (vv. 5, 34), eternal life (vv. 15-16, 36), and God so loving the world (v. 16). Among today&#8217;s Christians regeneration is a common term. Christians often declare that they have been regenerated of the Spirit, or born again. However, because the majority of believers do not live in their regenerated being, regeneration is not a reality to them in their daily living. How much do you live in your regenerated being? Is it not true that you still live quite much in your natural being? This means that you have regeneration positionally, but that you do not have regeneration experientially in your daily living. Day by day how much do you live in your regenerated being and how much in your natural being, your old being? Actually, it is difficult to answer this question, for we are not able to say how much we live in our regenerated being. But we may be certain that we live in our old being too much of the time.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit</h2><p>Many Christians also have a superficial and inadequate understanding of the Spirit. When speaking about the Holy Spirit, few Christians have a deep realization concerning the Spirit. For some, the term &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; has been spoiled by the talk about the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues.<h2 class=head2>Eternal Life</h2><p>John 3:15-16 and 36 speak of eternal life. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we often use the term &#8220;eternal life.&#8221; For Christians to follow the King James Version to speak of everlasting life instead of eternal life may be an indication that their realization of eternal life is superficial and low.<h2 class=head2>God So Loving the World</h2><p>John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life. This verse is very well known by Christians. When I was young, I was told that this is a golden verse. However, the understanding that many Christians have concerning God&#8217;s love for the world is quite superficial.<h2 class=head1>MATTERS CONCERNING WHICH CHRISTIANS HAVE VERY LITTLE REALIZATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Serpentine Flesh</h2><p>There are a number of matters in John 3 concerning which the majority of Christians have very little realization. The first of these matters is the serpentine flesh, which signifies the being of fallen man. Have you ever heard that we, fallen human beings, have a serpentine nature? Christians are short of the realization that sinners have a serpentine nature.<h2 class=head2>The Brass Serpent</h2><p>Another matter concerning which Christians are very short in their realization is the brass serpent, which signifies Christ in the form of the flesh of sin. We may have read chapter three of John again and again without paying attention to the brass serpent in verse 14. The brass serpent typifies Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says that Christ was made sin for us. Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin. But many Christians do not have any realization of what it means for Christ to be in the form of the flesh of sin.<p>Christ was a complete Substitute for us. Because we, as fallen people, are serpentine, it was necessary for Christ to have the form of a serpent but not its nature.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God. This expression was used by John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus. In John 3:14 the Lord Himself indicates that He was typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses. The Lamb of God fulfills God&#8217;s requirements. All the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory were fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God without blemish. Nevertheless, in order to be our Substitute it was not sufficient for Christ to be only the Lamb of God; it was also necessary for Him to be the brass serpent.<p>There are two aspects concerning Christ as the sin offering. The first is that the sin offering must fulfill all the requirements of God, the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God. The second aspect of the sin offering is that this offering must also be our substitute. We are sinners and also serpents, the offspring of vipers. For this reason, it was necessary for Christ our Substitute to have the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form, the likeness, of a serpent. This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as typified by the brass serpent.<p>Christ did not have the sinful nature. If He had had the sinful nature, then He also would have needed a substitute, for He would not have been qualified to be our Substitute. But although Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, He did not have the sinful nature. He was in the form of a sinner, but He did not have sin in His human nature. If Christ did not have the likeness of the flesh of sin, the form of a sinner, He could not have been our Substitute.<p>Regarding the sin offering, we have the aspect of the Lamb of God and also the aspect of the brass serpent. On the one hand, Christ fulfilled the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory and thereby accomplished redemption for us. On the other hand, as typified by the brass serpent, He died on the cross as our Substitute. He is both the Lamb of God and the brass serpent. However, not many of today&#8217;s Christians have the proper realization concerning this matter.<h2 class=head2>The Human Spirit</h2><p>John 3:6b says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; Here we have another matter concerning which many Christians have very little realization. This matter is the spirit. Often I have heard people say that before they came in contact with the Lord&#8217;s recovery, they did not know that they had a human spirit. Many Christians do not know that human beings have a spirit. Christians may talk about regeneration, but in their talk some may not apply John 3:6. This indicates that they do not know in what part of their being regeneration takes place. The realization that regeneration takes place in the human spirit is very much lacking among today&#8217;s believers. In fact, many hold to the concept that the spirit and the soul are synonymous terms. But the Scriptures reveal clearly that our spirit is different from our soul. If someone does not have the proper realization regarding the human spirit as our spiritual human being, it is difficult for him to understand the matter of regeneration.<h2 class=head2>The Bride and the Bridegroom</h2><p>With few exceptions, most Christians have read John 3. However, how many pay adequate attention to the word &#8220;bride&#8221; in verse 29? In this verse John the Baptist said, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; When I was a young Christian, I heard messages on Christ as our Bridegroom. I was told that the Lord Jesus would come back as our Bridegroom. But how poor it would be to have the Bridegroom without the bride! In the Bible we have a universal couple -the Bridegroom and the bride. The bride is the aggregate of regenerated persons, and the Bridegroom is Christ with whom all regenerated persons should be one.<h2 class=head2>Christ&#8217;s Increase</h2><p>John 3:30 speaks of Christ&#8217;s increase. This increase is the multiplication and reproduction of Christ. It is important for us to know that the regenerated part of our being is the reproduction, the multiplication, of Christ. This increase of Christ is His bride.<p>Speaking in a general way, we may say that those who believe in Christ and who have been regenerated are the increase of Christ. However, we need to study this matter thoroughly and ask what it is that makes us a part of Christ&#8217;s increase. Our natural life and living are not part of the increase of Christ. For example, if you speak in a natural, joking manner, you are not living as part of Christ&#8217;s increase. On the contrary, that way of speaking is part of the serpentine being, and the serpentine being cannot be part of Christ&#8217;s bride, His increase. Only the regenerated part of our being, our regenerated spirit, is Christ&#8217;s increase.<p>John 3:6 says that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Often we live and speak in a natural way according to the flesh. But there is another part of our being, the regenerated being, the spiritual being. This regenerated part of our being is a part of Christ&#8217;s increase.<h2 class=head2>The Unlimited Christ</h2><p>In 3:31-35 we see the unlimited Christ, the Christ who is all in all. The expression &#8220;the unlimited Christ&#8221; may be new to you. We shall define this in the next message.<h2 class=head2>The Immeasurable Spirit</h2><p>In 3:34 we have the immeasurable Spirit. The immeasurable Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is immeasurable in sphere and all-inclusive in nature.<p>We have listed eight matters in chapter three of John concerning which Christians have very little realization: the serpentine flesh, the brass serpent, the spirit, the bride, the Bridegroom, Christ&#8217;s increase, the unlimited Christ, and the immeasurable Spirit. Although John 3 is often used by Christians for teaching and preaching, most believers do not give adequate attention to these eight matters. Therefore, we need to pay our attention to them and have an adequate realization concerning them.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</h1><p>In our reading of John 3 we need a proper realization and appreciation of five matters: the serpentine human being (vv. 6,14), the universal increase of Christ (vv. 6, 30), the unlimited Christ (vv. 29-36), the immeasurable Spirit (vv. 5-6, 34), and eternal life (vv. 15-16, 36). Actually these five matters form the title of this message: &#8220;The Serpentine People Becoming the Universal Increase of the Unlimited Christ by the Immeasurable Spirit with the Eternal life.&#8221; I would call your attention to the adjectives used to describe people, increase, Christ, Spirit, and life. The people are serpentine, the increase is universal, Christ is unlimited, the Spirit is immeasurable, and the life is eternal. Let us now go on to consider each of these five matters.<h2 class=head1>THE SERPENTINE NATURE</h2><p>In John 3 the serpentine nature of human beings is unveiled. The Lord told Nicodemus, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh&#8221; (v. 6). In verse 14 the Lord said to him, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; This word implies that Nicodemus had a serpentine nature. Nicodemus may have been a gentleman, but he was a serpentine gentleman. Furthermore, Nicodemus may have considered himself a moral and good man. But no matter how good or moral he may have been outwardly, inwardly he had the serpentine nature. The Lord indicated to Nicodemus that as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so He would be lifted up on the cross to die as Nicodemus&#8217; Substitute. This surely indicates that, like all the other fallen human beings, Nicodemus was serpentine. Hence, in this chapter we definitely have the unveiling of the serpentine nature.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2><p>John 3:30 refers to the increase of Christ. The universal increase of Christ is related to the spirit, the spiritual part of a human being. John 3:6b says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; We believers have both a serpentine nature in our being and also a spiritual part of our being. We all need to recognize the fact that we have these two kinds of being. If we do not live in our spirit, then surely we shall live in our serpentine nature, no matter whether what we do is good or bad. It is possible for both good things and bad things to be done in our serpentine being.<p>The title of this message speaks of serpentine people becoming the universal increase of the unlimited Christ. Our regenerated human spirit is part of the increase of Christ, and this increase is Christ&#8217;s multiplication and reproduction. Through the process of regeneration, serpentine human beings can become part of Christ&#8217;s increase.<h2 class=head1>THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>From Above</h2><p>In chapter three of John we can see at least nine aspects of the unlimited Christ. First, the unlimited Christ is from above, that is, from the heavens: &#8220;He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all&#8221; (v. 31). At that time, Christ was in the flesh, and the flesh is from earth. But within Him there was a part that was from above, from the heavens.<h2 class=head2>Above All</h2><p>According to 3:31, the unlimited Christ not only comes from above, but also is above all. The One who comes from the heavens is above all. Even though He was on earth, under the heavens, yet He was above all. Because Christ is all-inclusive, unlimited, and universal, He is above all. While He was on earth, He was still in the heavens (v. 13).<h2 class=head2>Loved by the Father</h2><p>John 3:35 says, &#8220;The Father loves the Son, and has given all into His hand.&#8221; The words &#8220;the Father loves the Son&#8221; are very important. This verse implies that apart from Christ or besides Christ, nothing pleases God. Nothing that is outside of Christ is pleasing to God the Father. The Father loves only one person, and that person is Christ.<p>When some hear that Christ is the unique One loved by the Father, they may point out that John 3:16 tells us that God so loved the world. However, God&#8217;s love of the world is related to Christ. Apart from Christ, God does not love anyone or anything. Although God loves the world, if we did not have Christ, we would miss God&#8217;s love.<p>We need to put verses 16 and 35 together, and then we shall see where we can enjoy the Father&#8217;s love. Only in Christ can we enjoy the love of God the Father. We need to be in Christ by believing in Him. If we are outside of Christ, we have nothing to do with God&#8217;s love. Yes, God so loves the world, but we shall miss that love if we are not in Christ. We can meet the love of the Father only in Christ.<h2 class=head2>Given All Things by the Father</h2><p>John 3:35 says not only that the Father loves the Son, but also that the Father has given all things into the Son&#8217;s hand. The Father has given all things, including us, to Christ. The entire universe has been given to the Christ whom God the Father loves. He is the unique recipient of the Father&#8217;s love and gifts. This implies that if we are not in Christ, we shall not receive any gifts from the Father. Christ is the unique object of the Father&#8217;s love and also the unique recipient of the gifts given by the Father. If we would enjoy God&#8217;s love, we need to be in Christ. Likewise, if we would participate in what God gives, we also need to be in Christ. Paul says that all things are ours and that we are Christ&#8217;s (1 Cor. 3:21-23). If we are not for Christ, nothing can be for us.<h2 class=head2>Sent by God</h2><p>This One who is from above, who is above all, who is loved by the Father, and who has been given all things by the Father, has also been sent by God. Verse 34 says, &#8220;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; Christ is God&#8217;s Ambassador. He was sent by God and from God.<p>The Lord Jesus was sent not only from God, but also from with God. John 6:46 says, &#8220;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.&#8221; The Greek preposition translated &#8220;from&#8221; in this verse, para, means by the side of. The meaning here is &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Lord is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God. Furthermore, when the Lord came as the One sent from with the Father, the Father came with Him.<h2 class=head2>Speaking the Word of God</h2><p>According to 3:34, Christ as the One sent by God speaks the words of God. The Greek word translated &#8220;words&#8221; is rhema, which means the instant and present spoken word. It differs from logos, which means the constant word, as in John 1:1. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; Here also the Greek word rhema is used. The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious and intangible and difficult for us to comprehend. But the Lord&#8217;s words are substantial. First the Lord indicated that for giving life, He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit who is life.<p>The nature and essence of the Godhead is Spirit. John 4:24 says, &#8220;God is Spirit.&#8221; In this verse the word Spirit does not denote the Person of God; rather, it denotes the essence or nature of God. As the essence of a chair is wood, so the essence of God is Spirit. The Spirit is God&#8217;s essence.<p>How is it possible for God&#8217;s essence to enter our being? This is possible through Christ as the One sent by God. As God&#8217;s sent One, Christ is the first and foremost Apostle. Concerning this, Hebrews 3:1 says, &#8220;Wherefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.&#8221; The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God. As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of His life and nature. Furthermore, as the Apostle, God&#8217;s sent One and Ambassador, Christ speaks the word of God. The word Christ speaks is the rhema, the word that is spirit and life.<p>Many of us can testify that when we handle the Word of God properly by exercising our spirit, the word that comes into us becomes spirit, and when it becomes spirit, it also becomes life. When the word is spoken, it is still the word. But after it comes into us, the word becomes spirit and life. Then as we speak out the word that has become spirit and life within us, it once again becomes the word. After such a word enters into someone else, it again becomes spirit and life. In this way God, who is Himself Spirit and life, is spoken into us. By this means God&#8217;s essence is spoken into our being.<p>The word of the Lord Jesus is actually the essence of God. Therefore, when this word enters our being, God&#8217;s essence comes into our being. This essence is the Spirit.<p>Have you ever heard that the Spirit is God&#8217;s essence and that this essence is conveyed through God&#8217;s spoken word? I am deeply saddened by the fact that many Christians do not know this. Actually, concerning the Spirit, there is much confusion among believers today.<p>In the Old Testament God spoke in diverse ways, in different ways, through the prophets. But in the New Testament God speaks through only one person, and that person is His Son. Regarding this, Hebrews 1:1-2a says, &#8220;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&#8221; All the New Testament ministers of the Word are part of God&#8217;s speaking in the Son. Paul&#8217;s speaking in his ministry, for example, was part of this speaking of God in His Son. Likewise, today we are speaking the word of God in the Son, for we are all in the Son. We are not speaking the word of God outside of the Son; rather, we are speaking the word of God in the Son.<p>In our speaking we desire to be one spirit with Christ, the Son of God. Often before I minister the Word, I pray, &#8220;Lord, be one spirit with me in my speaking. Lord, I want to practice being one spirit with You in the speaking of Your word.&#8221; If I do not have the assurance that I am one spirit with the Lord, I do not have any desire to speak.<p>To be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking of the word means that we are truly in the Son of God. All the genuine speakers of the divine word of the New Testament are part of God&#8217;s speaking in the Son. Today God the Father speaks in the Son, and the Son includes all the New Testament ministers of the Word.<p>What are we doing as we carry on the ministry of the Word? We are speaking God into people. We are speaking the divine essence into others. Many of us can testify that as a result of listening to the genuine ministry of the Word, we receive the essence of God. We hear the word and receive it. Then after the word has been received by us, it becomes spirit and life in us. The Spirit is actually the essence of God becoming the very life within us. Any message that we listen to that cannot become spirit and life in us is not a proper message. Such a message may be correct doctrinally or scripturally, but it does not convey the essence of God. The word in our ministry must be the very essence of our God.<p>The unlimited Christ is from above, He is above all, He is loved by the Father, He has been given all things by the Father, and He has been sent by God as God&#8217;s Apostle. Now we must see that this One speaks the word of God. He does not speak His own word or someone else&#8217;s word-He speaks only the word of God. This word is spirit and life as the essence of God Himself.<p>In our speaking we need to be one spirit with the Lord so that we can speak the essence of God into others. When we preach the gospel, we should preach the essence of God into sinners. When we give a message, we should impart the essence of God into the saints. Whenever we minister the Word, we should impart the essence of God into others. This means that in the ministry of the Word we are stewards serving the saints with the essence of God as their nourishment. As a waiter serves others with food, so those who minister the Word of God should serve the saints with the essence of God. The essence of God is conveyed to us through the word of God.<p>The all-inclusive, unlimited Christ is continually speaking the essence of God into us. For this reason, all the speaking in the meetings of the church should be the speaking of this One. This means that He speaks in our speaking. Only He has come from above and is above all. Only He is loved by the Father, has been given all by the Father, and has been sent by the Father to speak God into us. We today should not be separate from Him as we speak. Rather, we should be joined to Him as one spirit and speak with Him so that He speaks in our speaking. Today the Lord is still speaking. He does not speak any word other than the word, the rhema of God, which is spirit and life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</h1><p>In the previous message we saw that the unlimited Christ is from above, that He is above all, that He is loved by the Father, that He has been given all things by the Father, that He was sent by God, and that He speaks the word of God. Let us now go on to consider some other characteristics of this unlimited Christ.<h2 class=head2>Giving the Spirit Not by Measure</h2><p>John 3:34 says of the unlimited Christ, &#8220;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; In what way does the unlimited Christ give us the Spirit? He gives us the Spirit by speaking the word of God. However, some Christians think that the way to receive the Spirit is to fast and pray for a period of time. But this practice may lead to emptiness instead. I can testify that the way of fasting and praying to receive the Spirit was not effective for me. What is the proper way to receive the Spirit without measure? It is by receiving the rhema of God. We can testify that if we handle the Word of God rightly and digest it in our spirit, we shall be filled with the Spirit of God. This is real in our experience.<p>The unique way for us to become the universal increase of the unlimited Christ is to receive the Spirit and be filled with the Spirit. The more we have of the Spirit, the more we shall be Christ&#8217;s increase. This increase begins with our regeneration, and it consummates with our being filled with the immeasurable Spirit.<p>We need to learn not merely to read the Word or study it, but also to eat it. We must learn to receive the Word of God into our spirit and digest it there. This is to enjoy the Word of God in our spirit. Many of us can testify that when we enjoy the Lord in this way, we are filled with the immeasurable Spirit.<p>In the past a number of us were influenced, distracted, or misled by the concept that we need to fast and pray for a period of time in order to suddenly receive the Spirit. The genuine filling of the Spirit is by taking the Word of God in a proper way through the exercise of our spirit. We shall not experience the filling of the Spirit by merely studying the Word in order to stimulate our mentality. That is not the right way to handle the Word of God. As we read the Word, we need to exercise our spirit. We need to exercise our spirit to receive God&#8217;s written Word so that it may become the present, spoken word to us. Then we shall have the word within us as spirit and life to us. In this way the all-inclusive Spirit will be given to us by the unlimited Christ.<p>Many of us can testify that as we are filled with the immeasurable Spirit through eating the Word, we realize that the Giver of this Spirit is the unlimited Christ. Christ Himself is unlimited, and the Spirit He gives to us is immeasurable. Therefore, our enjoyment of Christ and the Spirit becomes eternal. We enjoy eternal life, and this life produces the universal increase of the unlimited Christ. I hope that we all shall see this clearly.<h2 class=head2>Giving Eternal Life to His Believers</h2><p>Through the Word we receive the Spirit, and when we have the Spirit, we have eternal life. This understanding corresponds to what is revealed in John 6:63, where the Lord says that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This indicates that when we have the rhema, the living, spoken word, we also have the Spirit and life. Therefore, in this chapter we have the speaking of the word of God, the giving of the Spirit without measure, and the imparting of eternal life to those who believe in Christ. Verses 15, 16, and 36 all say clearly that those who believe in Christ the Son have eternal life. The unlimited Christ is the One who gives eternal life to His believers.<h2 class=head2>Having the Bride as His Universal Increase</h2><p>The unlimited Christ has the bride as His universal increase. This universal increase, Christ&#8217;s bride, is the aggregate of all those who have been regenerated. It is a living composition of all regenerated human beings. This is the bride as the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.<p>How can we become parts of the bride as Christ&#8217;s universal increase? This is possible only as we receive the rhema of God so that we may be filled with the life-giving Spirit. If we receive the word and are filled with the Spirit, we shall enjoy eternal life. The result is that we become the bride, the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The All-inclusive Compound Spirit Typified by the Compound Ointment</h2><p>Let us now consider the immeasurable Spirit. The word &#8220;immeasurable&#8221; not only denotes the sphere of the Spirit, but also denotes the contents and nature of the Spirit. The immeasurable Spirit is immeasurable in sphere. It is immeasurable also in contents and in nature, that is, in what the Spirit is. The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. (For the details concerning this see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157 to 166.) The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life. This immeasurable Spirit is actually the consummate expression of the Triune God.<p>The immeasurable Spirit is beyond our understanding. It is beyond our ability to speak concerning this all-inclusive Spirit. We simply do not have the utterance adequate to describe this immeasurable Spirit. We know that culture gives rise to words and terms in language. We do not yet have the spiritual culture necessary to have the language adequate to describe fully the immeasurable, all-inclusive Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>The immeasurable Spirit is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life. As the life-giving Spirit, He is ready to be received by those who believe in Him. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. In this way we become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>Today some oppose the truth that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. They say that as Adam became a living soul through creation, so Christ became a living Spirit through resurrection. However, they deny that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the Holy Spirit who gives life. However, they admit that the Holy Spirit gives life. This is an improvement over the concept that the Holy Spirit is simply an instrument or power and not a person. But Paul says that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became not only a spirit, but a life-giving Spirit. This does not denote merely the spirit of Christ as a being. Christ, of course, does have a spiritual being. In the Gospel of Mark we are told that when Christ was on earth, He perceived matters in His spirit (Mark 2:8). Furthermore, when He was dying on the cross, He committed His spirit to God the Father (Luke 23:46). We also know from the book of 1 Peter that after Christ was crucified and before He was resurrected, He went in spirit to Tartarus to proclaim God&#8217;s victory (1 Pet. 3:18-19). Before He was resurrected and while His body was still in the tomb, Christ&#8217;s spirit went to Tartarus to make such a declaration. In 1 Corinthians 15:45b Paul says that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit here is the Spirit who gives life. The spirit of Christ, which after His death and before His resurrection went to Tartarus, could not give life. But the Spirit who Christ became is the life-giving Spirit, identical to the Holy Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6).<p>Do you believe that there are two divine Spirits who give life? The belief in two life-giving Spirits is contrary to the truth. In 1977 I put out a booklet entitled What a Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! In this booklet we point out that according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the last Adam, who is Christ, became a life-giving Spirit. Some twist this verse, saying that it speaks of &#8220;a life-giving Spirit,&#8221; not &#8220;the life-giving Spirit.&#8221; But besides the Holy Spirit who gives life, is there another Spirit who gives life? To say that there are two Spirits giving life is to teach a great heresy. Whether the article is definite or indefinite, the last Adam, who is Christ Himself, became a Spirit who gives life. At this point we must refer to John 6:63, where the Lord says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life.&#8221; In this chapter the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life to give life to people. Eventually, He indicated that in order to be life as the bread of life, He must be the Spirit, for it is the Spirit who gives life. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, &#8220;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; Is not the Spirit in this verse the Holy Spirit? Can we say that besides this Holy Spirit who gives life there is another Spirit who gives life? No, we should not say this.<p>A second way of twisting 1 Corinthians 15:45 is to say that the life-giving Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, but the spirit of Christ as a person. Those who twist the verse in this manner say that just as we have a spirit, so Christ also has a spirit. Then they proceed to say that the Spirit here is the spirit of Christ, not the Holy Spirit. Certainly, the Spirit in this verse is the Spirit of Christ. But do you believe that besides the Holy Spirit there is another Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ? To put the matter another way, do you believe that besides the Spirit of Christ there is another Spirit called the Holy Spirit? I do not think that anyone with an enlightened understanding would believe this.<p>Those who twist 1 Corinthians 15:45 in this manner may not know that the Holy Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) and even the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7, lit.). Romans 8:9 testifies that the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Christ, and Philippians 1:19 testifies that the Spirit of Christ is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In his book, The Spirit of Christ, in a chapter entitled, &#8220;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus,&#8221; Andrew Murray says that after Christ&#8217;s ascension the Holy Spirit did not come as before. In the Old Testament He came only as the Spirit of God, but after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the Spirit came not only as the Spirit of God, but also as the Spirit of the Man, Christ. Furthermore, John 7:39 says that prior to Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection this Spirit was &#8220;not yet.&#8221; However, the Spirit of God was already there. Today the Holy Spirit is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ. This Spirit, who is the Spirit both of God and of Christ, is the life-giving Spirit. After His resurrection, through His resurrection, and in His resurrection, Christ became such a life-giving Spirit. Undoubtedly, this is the life-giving Holy Spirit.<p>Paul was careful in writing 1 Corinthians 15:45. He did not say, &#8220;The last Adam became a spirit.&#8221; He added the modifier, &#8220;life-giving,&#8221; saying, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; This modifier leaves no ground for argument. Who is the Spirit who gives life? Do you believe that besides the Holy Spirit, there is another divine Spirit who gives life? The truth is that there is only one divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, who gives life. The immeasurable Spirit in John 3 is the very life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.<p>The Bible is profound, but what is conveyed in the ancient creeds is incomplete and too simple. For example, the ancient creeds do not speak of the seven Spirits, a very important matter in the New Testament. In the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, the seven Spirits are spoken of emphatically (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). However, there is no mention of the seven Spirits in any of the ancient creeds. Because these creeds are not complete, some Christian groups declare that the only creed they hold to is the Bible. We would follow them to make the same kind of statement. We do not have any creed except the Bible. Because no creed is complete, we take the entire Bible as our only creed.<h2 class=head2>The Pneumatic Christ</h2><p>The all-inclusive Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit, is also the pneumatic Christ (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 8:9-11). I did not originate this term. It has been used by others, including one writer in Kittel&#8217;s Theological Dictionary of the New Testament. When we describe the Christ who lived on earth, we may speak of Christ in the flesh. The term &#8220;pneumatic Christ&#8221; refers to Christ as the Spirit. Due to the traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, some regard the Spirit as a person separate from Christ and then go on to speak of Christ being in the Spirit. Although it is commonly understood that the phrase &#8220;Christ in the flesh&#8221; refers to Christ Himself while He was on earth, not many understand the term &#8220;Christ in the Spirit&#8221; to mean that Christ is the Spirit. This has made it necessary for certain teachers to adopt the term &#8220;pneumatic Christ&#8221; to denote the Christ who is the Spirit. Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit. They do not realize that Christ is the Spirit.<p>The word &#8220;pneumatic&#8221; means spiritual. However, if we use the term &#8220;spiritual Christ&#8221; instead of &#8220;pneumatic Christ,&#8221; there may be misunderstanding.<p>Nowhere in the New Testament are we told that Christ, or the Son, is in the Spirit. The Bible does say that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is in the Father (John 17:21). But in the New Testament we do not have the thought that Christ is in the Spirit. Rather, the New Testament reveals that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; This is the pneumatic Christ, the very Christ who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.<p>In recent years I have read a number of books that point out that in Christian experience the resurrected Christ is identical to the Spirit. This is not a matter of theological doctrine; it is a matter of spiritual experience.<p>The immeasurable Spirit is actually the application of the unlimited Christ. When the unlimited Christ is applied to us, appreciated by us, and enjoyed by us, He is the immeasurable Spirit. Furthermore, this immeasurable Spirit is the eternal life.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>In chapter three of John eternal life is mentioned three times (vv. 15, 16, 36). Eternal life is the divine life, the life of the eternal God. This life is eternal in time, space, essence, function, and power.<p>This eternal life is the very essence of the Triune God becoming the element of the universal increase of Christ, which is the eternal expression of the Triune God. I would encourage you to dwell on this matter. Eternal life is the essence of the Triune God becoming the element of the church, the bride, and the bride is the universal increase of Christ. For eternity this will be the expression of the Triune God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TWO TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FOUR: JACOB&#8217;S WELL AND MOUNT GERIZIM</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 4:3-34, 39-42</h1><p>Our purpose in these messages is to pay attention to the signs in each chapter of the Gospel of John, regarding them as extracts of this mysterious book of divine things. In chapter four there are two signs. One is a well, and the other is a mountain. The well is Jacob&#8217;s well, and the mountain is Mount Gerizim. Have you ever regarded these two matters as the signs and extracts in this chapter? If we do not know these two signs, we cannot know this chapter in a deep way.<p>For years, I have treasured chapter four of John because it contains two matters that are wonderful and mysterious. The first is the living water, and the second is the worship in spirit and in truth. Even when I was a youth I came to know about these points in John 4. However, I did not know the real significance of this chapter.<p>The signs in the first three chapters of John are all genuine and typical. In chapter one we have six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God, Bethel. None of these signs is traditional. In chapter two we have two genuine, typical signs: the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the temple. In chapter three we have three genuine and typical signs: regeneration, the brass serpent, and the bride. Although the signs in chapters one, two, and three are typical and genuine, the two signs in chapter four are traditional. In a sense, the signs of the well and the mountain in John 4 are a mixture, for they are related to the territory of Samaria.<h2 class=head1>A PLACE OF MIXTURE</h2><p>Samaria was the leading region of the northern kingdom of Israel and the place where its capital was (1 Kings 16:24, 29). Before 700 B.C. the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen places to the cities of Samaria (2 Kings 17:6, 24). From that time the Samaritans became a people of mixed blood-heathen blood mixed with Jewish blood. History tells us that they had the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament. But they were never recognized by the Jews as part of the Jewish people.<p>Originally, Samaria was a good region, and it included the parcel of land Jacob bought in Genesis 33:19. In that territory was located the mountain of blessing, Mount Gerizim, the place where six of the twelve tribes of Israel declared the blessing of keeping the law (Deut. 27:12; Josh. 8:33). Opposite Mount Gerizim was Mount Ebal, where the other six tribes declared the curse of disobeying the law. Mount Gerizim, therefore, was a mountain of blessing. At that mountain there was a double blessing because it was a gift of the forefather, Jacob, and it was the place of God&#8217;s blessing.<p>We have seen that during the time of the kings, the people of Samaria became mixed with those who were pagans. Furthermore, the pagans brought in idol worship and mixed their worship with that of the worship of God practiced by the Jews. In this way Mount Gerizim became a place of mixture in worship. On Mount Gerizim the people practiced idol worship under the name of the Jewish God, Jehovah. They mixed their pagan worship with the worship of the genuine God.<p>Much of the worship among Christians today is also a mixture. In principle, it is the same as that practiced on Mount Gerizim: it is a mixture of pagan things with worship in the name of the true God. That mixture in worship at Mount Gerizim in Samaria was carried out by pagans and by pagan authority. Likewise, the mixture in traditional worship in Christendom was also first carried out under pagan authority.<p>The signs in John 4 are related to matters that are not pure. Yes, Jacob&#8217;s well was in a portion of Jacob&#8217;s land given to his beloved son, Joseph (Josh. 24:32). That was something pure. However, it was used by Samaritans, an impure people. Although the Samaritans claimed to be descendants of Jacob, they were a mixture. This was the reason that the Jews in ancient times would not recognize them or have any dealings with them. This was true even up until the time of the Lord Jesus. John 4:9 indicates this: &#8220;The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that you, a Jew, ask me for a drink, since I am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)&#8221;<h2 class=head1>TRADITION NOT ABLE TO SATISFY MAN&#8217;S THIRST</h2><p>What does the well of Jacob in John 4 signify? It signifies that tradition cannot satisfy man&#8217;s thirst. We all know that water is necessary for human life. Water is even more important than food, for thirst is more serious than hunger. You may go without food for several days and still live, but you cannot go nearly as long without water. In the Old Testament there are a number of stories that point out how crucial water is for human life (Gen. 21:15, 19; Exo. 15:23-24, 27; 17:6; Num. 20:8). In the Bible the record of man&#8217;s need of water to quench his thirst is found again and again. The well in the land of Jacob is a sign that traditional things cannot quench the thirst in human life. No matter how genuine or typical a tradition may be, as long as it is a tradition, it cannot satisfy man&#8217;s thirst. This is the significance of the sign of Jacob&#8217;s well in John 4.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED FOR A LIVING PERSON</h2><p>The sign of Jacob&#8217;s well should lead us to realize our need of something other than tradition, and this is our need for a living Person, the Son of God. In John 4:10 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &#8220;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&#8221; This gift is the Son of God Himself. Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son has been given to us, and John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life. In this God-given gift is eternal life.<p>We cannot separate eternal life from the gift of God. God&#8217;s gift to us includes both His Son and His divine life. These two are one gift, for the divine life is in the Son, and the Son actually is the divine life (John 14:6). Therefore, 1 John 5:11 and 12 say, &#8220;God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&#8221; The thirst in human life cannot be satisfied by tradition. Our thirst can be quenched only by a living Person, the One who has been given to us to be our eternal life.<p>The Samaritans had fallen into the error of trusting in traditions. The Samaritan woman in John 4 was trying to get water for her living from that traditional well, and she spoke to the Lord Jesus about worship on that traditional mountain. Her trust was altogether in these two traditions, in the well for human living and in the mountain for the worship of God.<p>Many Christians also put their trust in traditions. Much of their theology, doctrines, and teachings is traditional. Their rituals, regulations, formalities, and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, also are traditional. There is an interest among some Christians in returning to the so-called historic church, that is, in returning to traditional things.<p>Christians, however, should not care for traditions. Instead, we need to be renewed and refreshed by a living Person with the divine life. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is never traditional. He is always new, renewing, and refreshing. If we experience Him daily throughout our Christian life, we shall find that He is always new.<p>Our well is not Jacob&#8217;s well, a traditional well; our well is the Son of God. We have received Him, and He has become a spring of water welling up within us into eternal life. As He wells up within us, we are brought into eternal life. This welling up of the Lord within us quenches our thirst. I can testify that He wells up within me again and again. Whenever He wells up in me, I am brought into eternal life, and my thirst is satisfied.<h2 class=head1>A FOUNTAIN AND A SPRING</h2><p>Do you know the difference between the Lord as a fountain and the Lord as a spring? When the Lord is outside of us, objective to us, He is the fountain. But when He is inside of us, subjective to us, He is the spring.<p>When we were in the Holy Land some years ago, we visited the source of the River Jordan. At the foot of Mount Hermon, we saw a strong spring welling up. We were told that underneath the mountain there was a fountain, which was the source of that spring. That fountain was in the depths, whereas the spring was on the surface.<p>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is the fountain of living water; on the other hand, He is the spring. In God, the Lord is the fountain, but in us He is the spring. According to our experience, we know that the Christ who is in God is the source, the fountain. But when He enters into us and dwells in us, He becomes a spring welling up into eternal life.<h2 class=head1>NOT TRUSTING IN A TRADITIONAL WELL</h2><p>We should not trust in our Bible knowledge, in our past experience, or in traditional teachings we have received from others. All such things may be a Jacob&#8217;s well to us. Daily we need to remember and realize that we have a living spring within us and that this spring is a divine Person, the Son of God, who has been given to us by God as a gift. Praise the Lord that within us we have a spring that is the gift of God!<p>However, in their experience many Christians still have a traditional well and not a living spring. If you speak with them about the Spirit or eternal life, they may argue with you according to their tradition. Christians who trust in their traditions are like the Samaritan woman in John 4. I was such a Samaritan woman about fifty years ago. But I no longer put my trust in a traditional well. How about you? Do you have a &#8220;Jacob&#8217;s well,&#8221; or do you enjoy the living Christ? It is possible to be a Samaritan woman with a traditional well even in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. You may regard the books and the messages in the recovery as your traditional well.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that no well, regardless how genuine, typical, and ancient it is, can quench our thirst. Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of the Son of God, who has been given by God to be the spring welling up within us.<p>It is possible for us to take a Christian leader as our Jacob and his teachings as our well. Lutherans have done this with Martin Luther and his teaching concerning justification by faith. They may know about their &#8220;well,&#8221; but they may not know the living Person, Jesus Christ, as the living water within them.<p>Let me tell you an actual story involving a Lutheran pastor in China. This particular man was an opium smuggler while he was a pastor. One day a Norwegian woman evangelist came to the city where that pastor lived and began to preach the gospel. She did not preach about any kind of &#8220;well,&#8221; and she did not preach justification by faith in an old, traditional way. Rather, she preached regeneration by the living Spirit. After every message she would go immediately to the main entrance of the chapel and talk with those who were passing by. She would ask the same question of each person: &#8220;Have you been regenerated? Have you been born again?&#8221; That Lutheran pastor tried unsuccessfully to avoid her. She stopped him and in front of a number of people asked him if he had been regenerated. He answered that he had been regenerated. However, she said, &#8220;Look at you! You have never been regenerated!&#8221; Because this was spoken in the presence of members of his congregation, he was offended.<p>Insulted by the way this evangelist had spoken to him, the Lutheran pastor went home and spent much of the night plotting how to kill her. But at a certain time the Spirit of God began to point out to him how sinful he was. The Spirit said to him, &#8220;How evil you are! You are an opium smuggler. Because this woman rebuked you, you were offended, and now you are thinking of a way to kill her. Don&#8217;t you realize how sinful you are? &#8221;As a result of the Spirit&#8217;s work, he thoroughly repented and was truly saved and regenerated. The next day he attended the meeting and testified of what had happened to him. His testimony brought in a genuine revival. The experience of this Lutheran minister illustrates the difference between trusting in some traditional well and enjoying the renewing, refreshing Person of the living Christ, the Son of God.<p>Although traditional teaching does not count for anything as far as the living Christ is concerned, many Christians continue to depend on traditional things. In some cases their knowledge, including the knowledge of the Bible, is traditional. The Bible itself is not traditional, but it is taken in a traditional way by many Christians. Some may claim that they know all about the seed of the woman in Genesis 3 or about the names of the Lord in Isaiah 9:6. Yes, they may know these things, but they know them in the way of tradition, not in the way of life. In their way of handling the Word of God, there is no life, no freshness, no renewing.<p>We can testify that we truly love the Bible. However, we do not love the Bible in a traditional way. On the contrary, we love the Word because in it we can meet the living Person of the Son of God. He is the real gift of God with eternal life.<p>I am very concerned for some of the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. They come to the meetings again and again, but what do they receive? Do they receive more traditional teachings, or do they contact a living Person? When you listen to a message in a ministry meeting, do you receive a living Person as eternal life, or do you take the ministry as something traditional? We all must learn not to put our trust in any traditional well, but learn to experience Christ daily as the living water welling up within us into eternal life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TWO TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FOUR: JACOB&#8217;S WELL AND MOUNT GERIZIM</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 4:3-34, 39-42</h1><p>In the foregoing message we began to consider the two traditional signs in John 4: Jacob&#8217;s well and Mount Gerizim. We focused our attention on the sign of Jacob&#8217;s well and saw that this well signifies that nothing traditional can satisfy the thirst in human life. Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of Christ, the gift of God. In this message we shall consider the second sign, the sign of Mount Gerizim.<h2 class=head1>THE HISTORY RELATED TO MOUNT GERIZIM</h2><p>Mount Gerizim is also a traditional sign. Through a history involving three major steps this mountain became something traditional. First, as we have already mentioned, the land where Mount Gerizim was located was a treasure belonging to Jacob (Gen. 33:19). Jacob then gave this land as a particular inheritance to his beloved son, Joseph (Josh. 24:32).<p>Second, when the children of Israel were about to enter the good land, they were charged by God through Moses to declare God&#8217;s blessing to those who keep the law. This declaration was to be made on Mount Gerizim. Deuteronomy 11:29 speaks concerning this: &#8220;And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou gone to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.&#8221; According to Deuteronomy 27:12, six tribes were to stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people. This indicates that Mount Gerizim was the most important mountain in the territory given to Joseph by Jacob. Although Mount Gerizim did not equal Mount Sinai in importance, it is nevertheless a fact that the blessing related to keeping the law was declared on Mount Gerizim. That declaration concerning the keeping of the law made Mount Gerizim unique in importance.<p>Third, during the time of the kings, the Assyrians captured this territory, located in the northern Kingdom of Israel, and brought people from Babylon and other heathen places to that region and caused them to settle there (2 Kings 17:6, 24). As a result, pagan worship was brought in and was mixed with the worship of the true God. According to Josephus, a famous Jewish historian, Alexander the Great gave permission, approximately three hundred thirty years before Christ, to a man named Manasseh, a brother of the high priest, to build a temple on Mount Gerizim. This means that a Jew built a temple for the worship of God on the top of Mount Gerizim. That served to strengthen the concept held by the Samaritans that Mount Gerizim was the proper place for the worship of God.<p>This is the background for what the Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&#8221; (John 4:20). The Jews had ground from the Scriptures to insist that the right place for the worship of God was Jerusalem. The Samaritans, however, did not have the ground to claim that Mount Gerizim was the proper place. When a temple was built on Mount Gerizim by Manasseh, the mixture in worship was not only strengthened but also completed. More than two centuries later, in 126 B.C., that temple for this mixed worship was destroyed by another Jew named John Hyrcanus. This is a sketch of the history related to Mount Gerizim.<h2 class=head1>MIXTURE IN WORSHIP</h2><p>In chapter four of John we have a mountain and a well at the foot of the mountain. The well is for human living, and the mountain is for the worship of God. The Lord Jesus first pointed out to the Samaritan woman that Jacob&#8217;s well cannot satisfy man&#8217;s thirst in his human life. Second, the Lord Jesus indicated that the mountain on which the Samaritans worship cannot provide the kind of worship that is satisfying to God. Today we also have the matters of the thirst in human living and the worship of God. We need to be satisfied in life, and we must have the kind of worship that can satisfy God.<p>Among today&#8217;s Christians, many have not found satisfaction for their thirst, and their worship does not satisfy God. The reason their worship does not satisfy God is that it is a mixture. We have seen that on Mount Gerizim a form of worship was established under pagan authorities that mixed the things of paganism with various genuine matters of the Jewish religion. In principle, the same thing has happened in the so-called historic church. Under the authority of pagan rulers the things of paganism have been mixed with the things of Christian faith and worship. For example, the Council of Nicea was conducted under the authority of a pagan ruler, Constantine the Great. Both Christmas and Easter involve the mixture of pagan things with the genuine worship of God.<p>This kind of mixture is illustrated by the leaven in Matthew 13:33: &#8220;Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&#8221; This woman signifies the Catholic Church, which took many pagan practices and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity. Hence, Catholicism is altogether a mixture. This mixture has not been thoroughly purged out of the Protestant denominations. For example, Christmas was invented by Catholicism; however, it was inherited by Protestantism. The same is true of Easter. This is an illustration of the fact that the worship in which many Christians are involved is filled with mixture.<h2 class=head1>WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN REALITY</h2><p>The crucial point for us to see is that the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that genuine worship, the worship that God the Father is seeking, is not on a certain mountain, but in the human spirit: &#8220;Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father....God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&#8221; (John 4:21, 24). In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God&#8217;s habitation and the place of His name, was a type of the human spirit. According to the New Testament, God&#8217;s habitation is not on any mountain, nor is it even in the heavens. Rather, God&#8217;s habitation is in man&#8217;s spirit (Eph. 2:22). Actually, man&#8217;s spirit is God&#8217;s habitation and also the place of God&#8217;s name. If we go elsewhere to worship God, this indicates that we have given up God&#8217;s name. There is only one place where we can be preserved in God&#8217;s name, and that place is our spirit. When we come to our spirit, we keep God&#8217;s name and are preserved in His name. What name should we take for ourselves in our worship of the Father in spirit? We should not take any name. The genuine worship of the Father, the worship He desires, is the worship of Him in our spirit, as typified by the worship on Mount Zion.<p>The genuine worship of God the Father is in the spirit, and it is also in reality. The children of Israel were required to worship God on Mount Zion and with the offerings. We have seen that Mount Zion typifies our spirit. The offerings typify Christ as reality. Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which God&#8217;s people worship God. He is the genuine sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. This is the reason we speak of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John. In the Gospel of John we can see the real tabernacle and also the real offerings. The tabernacle is the enlargement of Christ, and the offerings are Christ Himself as reality. Today we worship God in our spirit with Christ as the reality of all the offerings. When the Lord Jesus instructed the Samaritan woman to worship God the Spirit in spirit and reality, He meant that she should contact God the Spirit in her spirit instead of in a specific place, and through Christ, instead of with the offerings. Now that Christ the reality has come, all the types and shadows are over.<h2 class=head1>WORSHIP THAT SATISFIES THE FATHER</h2><p>For more than forty years, I have been fighting the battle concerning the genuine worship of God. This battle has not yet been won, for in our meetings we can still see certain traditional things. We do not have that much reality of Christ as our offerings. Whenever you come to a church meeting, you should come with Christ as your sin offering and also as your burnt offering or meal offering. Actually, we all should come to the meetings with Christ as all the offerings. However, many still come to the meetings in a traditional way simply to sit quietly.<p>All the saints have a regenerated spirit. Why would so many not use their spirit to utter something of Christ in the meetings? I have observed that only certain ones, a minority, do most of the sharing and testifying. Sometimes you can anticipate ahead of time who is likely to speak in the meetings. Some saints attend the meetings again and again, but never utter a word concerning Christ. They attend the meetings to enjoy the singing and listen to a message. Do you know what this is? This is a traditional way of worshipping God, the way practiced by the majority of believers.<p>The way of worship practiced by many Christian groups is composed of traditional elements. There may be a program, or order of worship, that includes hymns, a solo, a prayer offered by the minister, the reading of the Bible, the taking of an offering, a sermon, and the benediction. Although we do not follow such an order in our worship, we still may be too much under the influence of tradition. Therefore, we need to exercise ourselves to have the kind of worship that will satisfy the Father. The worship God the Father desires is in spirit and with Christ as the reality of the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THREE IMPORTANT MATTERS</h2><h2 class=head2>Living Water</h2><p>In His conversation with the Samaritan woman in John 4 the Lord pointed out three important matters. First, He indicated to her that she needed the living Son of God as the fountain to become a spring of water welling up within her. First He said to her, &#8220;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water&#8221; (v. 10). Eventually He told her, &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life&#8221; (v. 14).<h2 class=head2>Worshipping in the Human Spirit</h2><p>Second, the Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman concerning the need of the human spirit to worship the divine Spirit: &#8220;An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him. God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&#8221; (vv. 23-24). This word was given to instruct her regarding the need of exercising her spirit to contact God the Spirit.<p>Here the Lord was not telling the Samaritan woman to worship God in the Holy Spirit. Actually, the Holy Spirit is the object of our worship, not the means by which we worship. We should worship the divine Spirit by means of our regenerated human spirit. The Lord says, &#8220;God is Spirit.&#8221; If we would worship this Spirit, we must worship Him in our spirit. Only spirit can worship the Spirit. The worshipping spirit is our human spirit, and the worshipped Spirit is the divine Spirit. Hence, the human spirit worships the divine Spirit.<p>This divine Spirit is the Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. The entire Godhead is Spirit. In John 4:24 &#8220;God&#8221; does not denote part of the Godhead, but denotes the full Godhead. However, due to the influence of systematic theology, some Christians try to separate the Father, Son, and Spirit. It is commonly taught that we should never pray to the Holy Spirit or worship the Holy Spirit. According to traditional teaching, we should worship God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ the Son by the power of the Holy Spirit. But the word of the Lord Jesus in verse 24 indicates that the entire Godhead is Spirit. In the Trinity not only is the Spirit, Spirit, but the Father and the Son are also Spirit. The Triune God is Spirit, and we worship Him as the divine Spirit by our human spirit.<p>In chapter four of John the Lord Jesus strongly emphasized the human spirit. However, worshipping the divine Spirit by the human spirit is very much neglected by today&#8217;s Christians. Instead of worshipping in spirit, many worship in programs, schedules, and rituals. We also may fail to worship in spirit when we come to the meetings. Do you attend the meetings of the church in your spirit? You may fail to come to the meeting in spirit. Instead, you may attend the meeting in your schedule, program, and way.<p>Whenever we come to a meeting of the church, we should come not in a ritual or form-we should come in our spirit. I can testify that I would not have peace within if I did not pray to stir up my spirit before coming to a meeting. All the saints need to have the practice of stirring up their spirit before they come to a meeting. Whenever we are about to come to a church meeting, we should stir up our spirit so that our spirit may be &#8220;lifed&#8221; in a full way.<p>In His conversation with the Samaritan woman the Lord pointed her to the two spirits-the divine Spirit and the human spirit. The divine Spirit is worshipped by the human spirit. Today we need to give careful attention to these two spirits.<h2 class=head2>Christ as the Reality of the Offerings</h2><p>The third matter the Lord pointed out to the Samaritan woman was the worship of the Father in reality. Christ is not only the living Son of God as God&#8217;s gift to us; He is also the reality of all the offerings. I encourage you to put into practice all that you have heard concerning Christ as the offerings. It would be helpful to read Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings. We should not take the messages on Christ as the offerings as mere teachings. We need to put those messages into practice and pray, &#8220;Lord, I want to take You as my sin offering and trespass offering so that I may partake of You as my burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. Lord, day by day throughout my life I want to enjoy You and participate in You as all my offerings.&#8221;<p>In our experience we need to have the living Son of God as the divine gift given to us, we need the worship of the divine Spirit by our human spirit, and we need Christ as the reality of the offerings. If we have these matters in our daily experience, we shall have a life that is fully satisfied by Christ, and in our church life we shall have a worship that will satisfy God to the uttermost. In our human life we need Christ as the living water, and in our church life we need Christ as the reality of the offerings. If we have Christ as the living water and the reality, we shall not have any traditional Jacob&#8217;s well or Mount Gerizim with its mixture in worship. Instead of tradition, rituals, or forms, we shall have a life in which we are satisfied and a worship that satisfies the Father.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47</h1><p>The more we consider the signs in the Gospel of John, the more we realize that this book is a word spoken by the Lord concerning divine mysteries. I do not believe that the natural mentality is capable of writing such a book. In this message we shall begin to consider the signs in chapter five of John. In this chapter there are at least eleven signs.<h2 class=head1>A CONDENSATION OF THE UNIVERSAL STORY</h2><p>God&#8217;s economy is to gain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ and with Christ. Christ is both the means and the element used by God to produce His dwelling place for the carrying out of His divine economy. This is the unique story in the universe.<p>We truly praise God for the Bible. Next to the Triune God Himself, the most wonderful matter in the universe is the Bible. I believe that as we spend more time studying the Bible, we shall become fully convinced that no other book can compare with it. The Bible is the book. Only this book deserves to be called the book. No other book reveals things from eternity past to eternity future. Furthermore, only in the Bible can we see God&#8217;s economy, the unique story in this universe. The divine story, which is a mystery, is God&#8217;s economy to fulfill the desire of His heart to obtain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ as the means and with Christ as the element.<p>In order for Christ to be the means and the element for God&#8217;s dwelling place, He must be the tabernacle and the offerings. If we see this, eventually we shall realize that the tabernacle and all the offerings are the structure of this universal mystery. Therefore, we may say that the real contents of the Bible are the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible are, in a very real sense, condensed into one book, and this book is the Gospel of John. Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have the condensation of the universal story of God&#8217;s economy.<p>We should never regard John&#8217;s Gospel as shallow or elementary. The language of this Gospel may be simple, but its contents are profound. The more I study the writings of John, the more I realize how profound, deep, divine, wonderful, and mysterious they are.<p>In our Life-study of the Scriptures we have completed all the New Testament books with the exception of Mark, Luke, Acts, and James. The Recovery Version of each book contains an outline of the book. The best outline is that of the Gospel of John. Consider the portion of the outline of the Gospel of John that covers chapter five:	<ol class="decimal" start="4">	<li>The need of the impotent-life&#8217;s enlivening (5:1-47)		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>The inadequacy of religion&#8217;s law-keeping and the sufficiency of the Son&#8217;s life-giving (vv. 1-9)</li>		<li>Religion&#8217;s opposition to life (vv. 10-16)</li>		<li>The Son equal with the Father in giving life and executing judgment (vv. 17-30)</li>		<li>The Son&#8217;s fourfold testimony (vv. 31-47)			<ol class="none">			<li>(1) The testimony of John the Baptist (vv. 32-35)</li>			<li>(2) The testimony of the Son&#8217;s work (v. 36)</li>			<li>(3) The testimony of the Father (vv. 37-38)</li>			<li>(4) The testimony of the Scriptures (vv. 39-47)</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol><p>The language used in this section of the outline is quite simple. However, it is not easy to explain what the different terms in the outline mean because they point to matters in this chapter that are profound and mysterious.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY INTO GOD&#8217;S TABERNACLE</h2><p>Although the terms used in the Gospel of John are deep and profound, Christians have lowered the significance of these terms because of the way they commonly use them. For example, in John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the way.&#8221; A number of Christian speakers have given messages on Christ as the way, emphasizing that He is the way to deal with persons and matters in our daily life. Some of these messages point out that if you do not know how to deal with your husband or wife, Christ is the way. Do you want to know how to discipline your children? Christ is the way. Do you want to know how to get along with others at work? Christ is the way. Not only have I heard messages like this, but in the past I also gave messages saying that Christ is the way to take care of various matters in our daily life. But I have come to realize that this understanding of the Lord&#8217;s word in John 14:6 is too low. In this verse the Lord is not saying that He is the way for us to deal with our husband or wife or with our children. Rather, He is the way for us to enter into God through Christ as the offerings. How profound this is! How can we enter into God&#8217;s tabernacle? Christ is the way. How can we have the forgiveness of sins and deal with indwelling sin, that we may participate in the enjoyment of God? Christ is the way.<p>It is common for Christians to say that Christ is the way for us to go to heaven. According to this understanding of John 14:6, the Lord Jesus is saying that apart from Him there is no way to heaven. But this understanding is far from adequate. Here the Lord Jesus is not saying that He is the way for sinners to go to heaven. Instead, He is telling us that He is the way for us, God&#8217;s creatures who have been redeemed by His blood, to enter into God. How marvelous that Christ is the way for us to enter into God and also to dwell in God! He is the way for us to take God as our dwelling, and He is also the way for us to become God&#8217;s dwelling. How profound this is!<h2 class=head1>A WELL AND A MOUNTAIN</h2><p>I can testify that I appreciate very much the messages on John 4 in this series on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and offerings in the writings of John. When we were on chapter four, we saw the two traditional signs in John 4: Jacob&#8217;s well and Mount Gerizim. Jacob&#8217;s well signifies that nothing traditional can satisfy the thirst in human life. Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of Christ. Mount Gerizim signifies mixture in worship. The traditional well cannot satisfy us in our human life, and the traditional mountain cannot satisfy God in the matter of worship. Therefore, in our experience we need to have the living Son of God as the divine gift given to us to satisfy the thirst in our living, and we need the worship of the divine Spirit by our human spirit, with Christ as the reality of the offerings, to satisfy God. If we have both these matters, we shall have a life that is fully satisfied by Christ, and in our church life we shall have a worship that will fully satisfy God. Instead of tradition, we shall have a human life in which we are satisfied and a worship that satisfies the Father. I hope that all the saints will see the significance of the two signs in John 4. What is revealed in chapter five concerning signs is even more profound than what is revealed in chapter four.<p>We have seen that in John 1 there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. In chapter two there are two signs: the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the destroyed temple. These signs indicate the changing of death into life for the purpose of raising up the house of God. These two chapters have laid the foundation for a proper understanding of the remainder of this Gospel.<h2 class=head1>TWO ILLUSTRATIONS</h2><p>In chapter three John gives us the illustration of Nicodemus. For the fulfilling of the tabernacle and the offerings, even such a good man as Nicodemus needed to be terminated and buried and then germinated by the Spirit and with the Spirit. This was the reason the Lord said to him, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&#8221; (3:5). Although Nicodemus was a good man, he nevertheless had the serpentine nature. That was the reason he needed to be terminated and buried. After termination is germination. To be germinated is to be regenerated of the Spirit in order to become part of the increase of Christ. The thought here is extremely high.<p>I am sad that some Christians have lowered the significance of John 3:14-16. Yes, they regard John 3:16 as a golden verse; however, they do not appreciate this verse in the highest way. They may not see that even the best ones among the human race need to be regenerated. Our old nature needs to be terminated, our old man needs to be buried, and our spirit needs to be regenerated. Then we shall be a new man as part of the increase of the all-inclusive Christ.<p>In chapter four we have another illustration, that of the Samaritan woman, an immoral woman who was seeking satisfaction in her life. In her seeking, she pretended to be concerned about the worship of God. What a pretense! What a mixture! In chapter three we do not see mixture-we see the serpentine nature. But in chapter four we have the matter of mixture. The source of the Samaritan woman&#8217;s satisfaction in her human life needed to be replaced, and the source of her worship of God needed to be changed.<p>John&#8217;s Gospel was written not according to historical sequence but according to spiritual significance. This means that John selected a number of things the Lord Jesus did and used them to compose his Gospel. John 20:30 and 31 say, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221;<p>John selected the cases of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman as two illustrations. The case of Nicodemus illustrates the fact that although we may be good, our nature nonetheless is serpentine, and we need to be terminated, buried, and germinated. But we also are like the immoral Samaritan woman. There is no satisfaction in our living, and with us there is no worship that can satisfy God. Therefore, we need Christ to be our satisfaction and also to be the One who can satisfy God in our worship of Him.<h2 class=head1>A FEAST OF THE JEWS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Feast of Purim</h2><p>Now we come to the case of the impotent man in John 5. This case is quite complicated and involves a number of points. The first point concerns a feast of the Jews. John 5:1 says, &#8220;After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&#8221; There has been argument among Bible teachers concerning which feast is referred to in this verse. Before we consider this matter, I would like to point out that the Gospel of John is a book of feasts. Much more is said regarding feasts in John&#8217;s Gospel than in the synoptic Gospels. According to Leviticus 23, the children of Israel had seven annual feasts: Passover, unleavened bread, firstfruits, Pentecost, trumpets, Atonement, and tabernacles. In the Gospel of John the feast of Passover is mentioned at least three times (2:13; 6:4; 12:1). Chapter seven mentions the feast of tabernacles. Then in John 10:22 we read of the feast of Dedication, a feast held in addition to the seven feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23.<p>Besides the seven annual feasts from Passover through tabernacles, the feasts ordained by God, the Jews added two other feasts: the feast of Purim and the feast of Dedication. The origin of the feast of Purim is recorded in the book of Esther (Esth. 9:17-28). We know from the book of Esther that Haman, an enemy of the Jews who was next in power to the king of Persia, plotted to exterminate all the Jews. In the first month of the year Haman cast lots in order to choose a date on which the Jews would be exterminated: &#8220;In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar&#8221; (Esth. 3:7). Eventually, by lot they selected the twelfth month, the last month of the year, called Adar. The Passover is on the fourteenth day of the first month, and the day chosen for the destruction of the Jews was the thirteenth day of the last month. However, Haman&#8217;s plot against the Jews did not succeed. Haman&#8217;s evil intention was exposed, and he and his sons were hanged. Then on the very day the Jews would have been put to death, instead they gained the victory over their enemies (Esth. 9:1-5). Then it was established that the Jews &#8220;should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, as the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor&#8221; (Esth. 9:21-22). Those days were called days of lots or Purim. The word &#8220;Purim&#8221; means lots, the word &#8220;Pur&#8221; being the singular form for the word for lot (Esth. 3:7; 9:26). &#8220;Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur&#8221; (Esth. 9:26).<p>For the Jews, the days of sorrow became days of joy. We may also say that the days of death became the days of life, because the Jews passed out of death into life. That was the origin of the feast of Purim. The Jews used the word Purim in an ironic way. Haman had plotted to kill them, but instead he was the one who was executed.<p>We have indicated that the other additional feast was the feast of Dedication. That feast commemorated the cleansing and recovering of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus, approximately one hundred sixty years before Christ.<p>After much study I have come to believe, along with others, that the feast in John 5:1 is the feast of Purim. Modern chronologists have concluded that, according to the chronology in the Bible, the feast of the Jews here must be the feast of Purim. According to the record of the four Gospels, we know that the ministry of the Lord Jesus lasted for more than three years. This can be determined by studying those verses in the Gospels that mention the feasts. The record of the feasts is more clear in the Gospel of John than in the synoptic Gospels.<h2 class=head2>The Feasts in John&#8217;s Gospel</h2><p>We have seen that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. The offerings are closely related to the feasts. The annual feasts ordained by God in His law were times for presenting offerings to God. When the children of Israel came together to keep the feasts, they offered many offerings to God. Therefore, it was necessary for John in his Gospel, a book concerning the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, to speak about the feasts. For the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings we need the feasts.<p>John 2:13 says, &#8220;And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&#8221; This is the first of the feasts mentioned in the Gospel of John. The second time a feast is mentioned is in 5:1, which speaks of a feast of the Jews. We have seen that this is the feast of Purim. The feast of Purim was at the new moon between today&#8217;s calendar months of February and March. The Passover is a month later, at the new moon between March and April. Therefore, from the Passover in John 2:13 to the feast of the Jews in 5:1 is a period of almost a year.<p>John 6:4 says, &#8220;Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.&#8221; This is the second time the feast of the Passover is mentioned in John&#8217;s Gospel. There was an interval of a little more than a year between 5:1 and 6:4. Perhaps you have not realized that there is such an interval between chapters five and six. Then from the Passover in 6:4 to the Passover in 12:1, at which time the Lord Jesus was crucified, is another year. This means that from the Passover in 2:13 to the Passover in 12:1 is a period of three years. From 2:13 to 5:1 is one year; from 5:1 to 6:4 is a second year; and from 6:4 to 12:1 is the third year. It is in this way that it can be determined that the Lord&#8217;s ministry lasted for more than three years. Even this record concerning the feasts is related to the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head2>Passing out of Death into Life</h2><p>According to the study of chronology, the feast of the Jews in 5:1 is the feast of Purim. According to spiritual significance also, this must be the feast of Purim. This chapter speaks of passing out of death into life: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life&#8221; (5:24). The expression &#8220;passed out of death into life&#8221; may be used to describe the feast of Purim, for that was a time for the Jewish people to pass out of death into life. Their destiny under Haman had been death. But suddenly the situation was turned, and they passed out of death into life. Now we can understand why in 5:24 the Lord Jesus speaks of passing out of death into life. He speaks in this way here because of the background of the feast of Purim.<p>Do you know what our destiny was before we were saved? Our destiny was destruction. Our Haman was the Devil, Satan. He cast lots concerning us to appoint a time when we should be slaughtered, terminated. Thus, our destiny truly was death and destruction. But our God turned the situation, and the &#8220;lot&#8221; fell on Satan and his followers. As Haman and his sons were hanged on the gallows, so Satan and his followers were hanged on the cross. Satan had plotted to destroy us, but eventually he was the one who was destroyed (Heb. 2:14). Now we have passed out of death into life, and we can enjoy the real feast of Purim. What good news this is!<p>The Passover mentioned again and again in the Gospel of John is a sign of Christ as the real Passover. Likewise, John selected the case in chapter five to show that Christ is also the real feast of Purim. This indicates that Christ is our &#8220;lot,&#8221; but the lot for germination, not for termination. He is the lot for us to pass out of death into life. The Jews continue to celebrate the feast of Purim. But we need to realize that the real feast of Purim is Christ, the living Son of God. Only He can turn the lot from death to life. This is the significance of the sign of the feast of the Jews, the feast of Purim.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the traditional signs in John 5.<h2 class=head1>THE SHEEPGATE</h2><p>John 5:2 says, &#8220;Now there is in Jerusalem at the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.&#8221; The first sign mentioned in this verse is that of the sheepgate. The sheepgate, one of the gates of the city of Jerusalem, signifies the door to traditional religion&#8217;s sheepfold (John 10:1). This was the gate for the people of God, who are His sheep, to enter into the fold for protection. The city of Jerusalem was a sheepfold to protect God&#8217;s people. Jerusalem with the sheepgate is also a sign. Only Christ, the living Son of God, can be the reality of what this sign depicts. Christ is our gate and also our city. In John 10:7 the Lord Jesus says clearly, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.&#8221; Then in verse 9 He again says, &#8220;I am the door.&#8221; Christ is the door not for the sheep to go into the fold, but for them to come out of the fold. Because we have Christ as our Shepherd, we do not need the fold. Christ is the gate, the door, for us to come out of the fold and enjoy Him as our pasture.<h2 class=head1>THE POOL OF BETHESDA</h2><p>The pool of Bethesda in 5:2 is also a sign. Bethesda means house of mercy, and the pool of Bethesda was the traditional place to receive mercy. The pool of Bethesda signifies that the religious people, who tried their best to keep their religion, realized their need for God&#8217;s mercy. This pool signifies that the real house of God&#8217;s mercy is the living Son of God.<h2 class=head1>FIVE PORCHES</h2><p>John 5:2 says that the pool of Bethesda had five porches. These porches were shelters to cover the needy ones. Under these shelters were those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered. The number five denotes responsibility, and the five porches here signify traditional religion&#8217;s shelter depending on man&#8217;s responsibility.<p>We have seen that these five porches sheltered the needy ones. Under the law, we are those who are sick, blind, lame, and withered. Now that Christ has come, we are no longer under the law, and we do not need the porches to shelter us. The man who was sick for thirty-eight years needed the porches to cover him. But after the Lord healed and enlivened him, he could carry his bed, and he no longer needed to lie under the cover of the porch.<h2 class=head1>THE MULTITUDE</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the stirring of the water.&#8221; This multitude signifies that under the shelter of traditional religion there are many needy people who lack the life supply.<h2 class=head1>AN ANGEL OF THE LORD</h2><p>Verse 4 speaks of an angel of the Lord: &#8220;For an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever then stepped in first after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was held by.&#8221; Here the angel signifies the agent through which the law was given (Gal. 3:19, 21), but which could not give life. Angels occupied an important position in the Jewish religion.<p>Here in John 5:4 we are told that the angel went down into the pool at certain seasons and stirred up the water. But this stirring up by the angel was not any help to the impotent man, for he could never be the first one to step into the pool after the stirring up of the water. He could not fulfill the requirement to be healed. This indicates the inadequacy of trying to keep the law. The law is complete and perfect, but it cannot give life to the impotent. In the sight of God the impotent man was dead. The law can do things for us under certain conditions and as long as certain requirements are fulfilled. But how can a dead person fulfill the requirements of the law? No matter how often the angel came and stirred up the water, this stirring up would not be effective for a dead person. A dead man cannot be helped by the stirring up of the water by an angel. He can be helped only by the Son of God who enlivens us and gives us life. The Son of God does not come to stir up the water; He comes to give life.<h2 class=head1>THE STIRRING UP OF THE WATER</h2><p>The stirring up of the water is also a sign. This is a sign of traditional religious practices to make people perfect. The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the traditional practices of religion that attempt to make people perfect. We should not put our trust in any traditional practices. It is possible to have such practices even in the church life. In your church life you may depend on a particular practice to &#8220;stir up the water,&#8221; with the thought that this practice will make you perfect. Actually, no practice can help us to be perfect. The only One who can perfect us is Christ, the living Son of God, who enlivens us.<h2 class=head1>THE SABBATH</h2><p>John 5:10 says, &#8220;The Jews then said to the one who was healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to pick up your bed.&#8221; The Sabbath is a sign of the religious way of rest. The Sabbath, a day of rest, is surely something good. But for the man who had been impotent for thirty-eight years, there was no rest, not even on the Sabbath. Who could give him rest and be his real Sabbath? The only One who could give him this rest is the living Son of God.<p>It is significant that the Lord Jesus healed the impotent man on the Sabbath day. But the Jews told the one who had been enlivened by the living Son of God that it was not lawful for him to pick up his bed on the Sabbath. To them, it was wrong for him to do the work of carrying his bed on the Sabbath day. No doubt, the man who had been healed was happy to carry his bed. He had been carried by that bed for thirty-eight years, and now that he had been healed, he was able to carry it instead. What kind of law forbade him to carry his bed on the Sabbath? Such a law was not an enlivening law, but a killing law. The one who had been healed said to the Jews, &#8220;He who made me well, He said to me, Pick up your bed and walk&#8221; (v. 11). When they asked him who had told him to do this, he answered that he did not know who it was (vv. 12-13).<p>This incident shows how religion contradicts the activities of the living Son of God. Whatever the Lord Jesus Christ does is condemned by religion. The religion that condemned Him in John 5 was not a heathen religion, nor a religion of mixture such as that practiced by the Samaritans. Rather, it was the pure, typical religion practiced in Jerusalem. But even this genuine religion contradicted the living activity of the Son of God.<p>We should not think that, because the church life is real and genuine and not a mixture, it in itself can do something for us. Not even the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in itself can do anything for us in life. Jesus Christ Himself is the only One who can do everything for us and be everything to us in life.<h2 class=head1>JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2><p>After the sign of the Sabbath we have the sign of John the Baptist (vv. 33-35). We may say that John the Baptist became for the Jews a sign who was both traditional and new. The Lord said concerning John the Baptist, &#8220;He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light&#8221; (v. 35). This indicates that he was their temporary religious trust. For a while, the Jews went to John the Baptist, but they would not come to the living Son of God. John the Baptist came to introduce this living One to them. Nevertheless, they stayed with John the Baptist, but they did not receive the One concerning whom he testified. This means that they took John as a replacement for Christ and accepted John, but they would not receive Christ, the real One.<p>In principle, a similar thing happens today when Christ is replaced. Many things that have been used by God have become replacements of Christ. This is true of persons as well as things. To some people, Christian leaders like Martin Luther and John Wesley have become a replacement for Christ. As John the Baptist was taken in place of Christ by the Jews, so today certain Christian leaders are taken by Christians as replacements of Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p>John 5:39 says, &#8220;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me.&#8221; The Scriptures are the holy Word of God. But even the Word of God can be taken as a replacement of Christ. This was the reason the Lord told the Jews that they searched the Scriptures, thinking that in them they could find eternal life, but they were not willing to come to Him for life. Apart from Christ, the living Son of God, not even the Scriptures can give us life.<p>If it is true that not even the Scriptures can give us life apart from Christ, it is all the more true that the Life-study Messages cannot give life apart from Him. I am somewhat concerned that those who have received much help from these messages may, at least to some extent, put their trust in these messages instead of in the Lord Himself. Certain ones may read the Life-study Messages without directly contacting the Lord. In such a case, these messages would be taken as a replacement of Christ. But not even the Scriptures, and certainly not the Life-study Messages, should ever be used to replace Christ.<h2 class=head1>MOSES</h2><p>In 5:45 and 46 the Lord Jesus spoke to the Jews concerning Moses: &#8220;Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you trust. For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me.&#8221; The person of Moses is also a sign, a sign of a constant religious trust. John the Baptist was a temporary religious trust, but Moses was a constant religious trust. In principle, we may have our own religious trusts today, both temporary and constant. For example, someone may have a temporary trust in the Life-study Messages and a constant trust in the writings of Paul. But neither the Life-studies nor Paul&#8217;s writings are Christ Himself, and they should not ever replace Him.<h2 class=head1>SEARCHING THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p>The last sign in chapter five of John is that of the searching of the Scriptures. This is a sign of the religious way to find eternal life. All Christians agree that we need to search the Scriptures in order to receive the supply of life. However, many read the Bible without obtaining any life supply, because they study the Bible apart from the living Son of God.<h2 class=head1>ALL THE SIGNS POINTING TO THE LIVING SON OF GOD</h2><p>In addition to the sign of the multitude of sick, blind, lame, and withered people, we have eleven signs in this chapter: the feast of the Jews, the sheepgate, the pool of Bethesda, the five porches, an angel of the Lord, the stirring up of the water, the Sabbath, John the Baptist, the Scriptures, Moses, and the searching of the Scriptures. All these signs point to the living Son of God. We need Christ, the Son of God, to be the reality for the supply of life. The signs in this chapter are typical, genuine, and pure. None of them is a mixture or related to anything heathen. But none of these matters should replace the Son of God. Only He can give us life. He works together with the Father as one (5:17-20), He gives life to people, and He judges (vv. 21-30, 40).<p>I am deeply concerned that many of us still have replacements of Christ. We may trust in the church life, we may trust in certain ways or practices, and we may trust in messages. I am burdened that we all realize that nothing apart from Christ can give us life. Only He who is the living Son of God, the One sent by God, is the life-giver. Because only He can give us life, we must contact Him.<p>Christ is everything to us. He is not only our feast of Passover, Pentecost, and tabernacles; He is also our feast of Purim, the feast of our lot and destiny. Our destiny is Christ. If we have Him, we pass out of death into life. But if we do not have Him, we remain in death. Christ is also our gate, our city, and our pool. He is the real stirring up of the water. John the Baptist cannot compare with Him. Because Christ is the real Word of God, we must come to Him when we read the Bible, instead of coming to the Scriptures apart from Him. If we do this, then as the Word of life, He will give us life. Christ is also our real Moses, the One sent to us by God. He speaks for God, and He speaks forth God. This means that He speaks God into us. We should not put our trust in anything or anyone apart from Christ. Only Christ can give us life.<p>Because Christ is the unique One who can give us life, we need to contact Him day by day and even moment by moment. He is not far from us, for he is in our mouth, in our heart, and in our spirit (Rom. 10:8). We simply need to open from the depths of our being and call on His name. Whenever we open to the Lord and call on Him in this way, we contact Him and receive Him.<p>According to John 20:22, Christ is the holy breath, the life-giving Spirit. Because He is this breath, we can breathe Him in at any time. But contacting the Lord in this way depends upon our breathing of Him. If we do not breathe Him into us, we shall not be able to contact Him and receive Him. Our need is to contact Christ, receive Christ, and live by Christ.<p>We should not allow even the best spiritual things to replace Christ. This principle applies to the church life and to any practices we have. Why do we come to the meetings? We should come not for the sake of the meetings themselves, but for the sake of the living One who is ministered to us through the meetings, the only One who is able to enliven us again and again. It is of vital importance that we see that no holy thing, no religious thing, no spiritual thing, no traditional thing, can replace Christ. Not even the most up-to-date practices or the most spiritual matters can replace Christ. Only the present Christ, the living Christ, the Christ we are enjoying and experiencing at this very moment, can be our genuine help. This, I believe, is the significance of all the signs in this chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel.<p>John 5 reveals that only Christ, the living Son of God, is the real fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. The tabernacle and the offerings are not fulfilled by such things as the feast, the Sabbath, the gate, the city, the pool, the angel, the stirring up of the water, the Scriptures, or the searching of the Scriptures. Nor are they fulfilled by such persons as John the Baptist and Moses. The fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is only by the living Son of God, the One who is now the life-giving Spirit, the holy breath for us to breathe in so that we may receive Him as our life supply.<p>In chapter three of the Gospel of John we see Christ as the brass serpent, as the Bridegroom, and as the all-inclusive One. In chapter four we see Christ as the fountain of living water and as the reality with which we render genuine worship to God. Now in chapter five we see that Christ is everything. Because Christ is everything, nothing in the sphere of religion should ever replace Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 6:1-21, 26-69</h1><p>It may seem that the record in chapter six of John is easy to understand. Actually, this is the most difficult chapter in the Gospel of John from which to obtain the extract. In contrast, it was easy for us to have the extract in chapter one, for we could easily see the six main signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. However, as I was considering chapter six, it seemed to me that there were hardly any signs in this chapter, and if there are no signs, there is no extract, since the signs are the basis for the extract.<p>Under the inspiration of the Spirit, John used the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as a basis for saying certain things that are different from what is recorded in the synoptic Gospels. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand, but none of them says anything concerning the bread of life, the bread that came down from heaven to give life to the world. John is unique in taking the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as a basis for speaking concerning Christ as the bread of life. Therefore, there can be no doubt that the feeding of the five thousand was an event of great significance.<h2 class=head1>SOME BASIC THOUGHTS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>In order to have the extract of John 6 we need a basic understanding of certain matters. First, John told us that in writing his Gospel he selected certain things done by the Lord Jesus and used them in composing this book. &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name&#8221; (20:30-31). It is quite meaningful, then, that John inserted chapter six after the five preceding chapters.<h2 class=head2>A Sketch of This Gospel</h2><p>We have seen that chapter one has six signs. This chapter is a sketch of the entire Gospel of John and reaches from eternity past (1:1) to eternity future (1:51). Between eternity past and eternity future there is the bridge of time. On this bridge a number of things are happening for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<h2 class=head2>The Principle and Goal of Life</h2><p>The two signs in chapter two-the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the destroyed temple-give us the principle of life and show us the goal, or purpose, of life. The principle of life is to change death into life, and the goal of life is to produce the dwelling place of God in resurrection.<h2 class=head2>Two Cases</h2><p>In chapters three and four John presents two very interesting cases. The first, in chapter three, is that of a learned Jewish gentleman. The second, in chapter four, is that of an immoral Samaritan woman. With the case of Nicodemus we see that even a good man has the serpentine nature and needs to be regenerated to have a new life by a new birth in order to become a new man as part of the increase of Christ. This thought is deep. With the case of the Samaritan woman we see someone who needs Christ to be the source of her life and the means for her to worship God. Both for her living and for her worship of God, the Samaritan woman needed Christ. Christ is the fountain of living water, and He is also the truth, the divine reality, for the worship of God. In these two chapters with the cases of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman we can see what people need today. People need a new birth with a new life in order to be a new man so that they may become part of Christ&#8217;s increase. Even such a new person, a regenerated person, still needs Christ as the source of life, as the fountain of living water, and also as the means, the reality, for the worship of God.<h2 class=head2>Everything Empty without Christ</h2><p>Chapter five of John reveals that everything, even things that are good and holy, are empty apart from Christ. Only Christ can meet man&#8217;s need, for no one and nothing other than Christ can enliven us. The holy feast is empty without Christ, and the Sabbath is not a true rest apart from Christ. Furthermore, without Christ the holy city, Jerusalem, is nothing. What, then, about the pool of Bethesda? We have seen that the word Bethesda means the house of mercy and that Christ Himself is the real house of mercy. Apart from Christ, there is no house of mercy. Apart from Christ, the sick, blind, lame, and withered ones (5:3) would not be able to receive mercy. Furthermore, without Christ even John the Baptist and Moses are nothing. Even the holy Scriptures, though inspired by God, are empty apart from Christ, for without Christ there is no eternal life in the Scriptures. It is very important for us to see that without Christ everything is empty, vain.<p>In the Gospel of John there are certain basic thoughts. First, we need a new birth in order to have a new life that we may become a new man. We also need Christ as the source of life and as the means for us to worship God. Furthermore, if we do not have Christ, everything is empty. This means that if we do not have Christ, we are empty. Christ is the reality, and we need to be filled with Him. Apart from Christ, everything is empty. Only Christ is the divine reality.<h2 class=head2>Truth, the Divine Reality</h2><p>John&#8217;s Gospel and Epistles emphasize the matter of the truth. Recently I have been studying this word in John&#8217;s writings. The more I study, the more I realize how profound this is. Truth is the divine reality, the reality that came with Jesus Christ. When Jesus came, grace and truth came (John 1:17). The divine truth revealed in the Gospel of John is actually the Triune God embodied in Jesus Christ and expressed through Him.<h2 class=head1>THE POOL IN JERUSALEM AND THE SEA IN GALILEE</h2><p>Much of what is recorded in chapters one through five of the Gospel of John took place in Jerusalem. Half of chapter two and all of chapter three describe matters that took place in Jerusalem. All of chapter five records events that happened in Jerusalem. We have seen that chapter four is a record of something that occurred in Samaria. The feeding of the multitude in chapter six of John took place in Galilee. Judea signifies the religious world, and Galilee signifies the secular world. In Judea there was Jerusalem, the holy city, but in Galilee there was the sea. Between Galilee and Judea was the territory of Samaria, which was partly religious and partly secular.<p>It is significant that in chapter five we have a pool, and in chapter six we have the sea. Furthermore, the pool is in the holy city, and the sea is in the secular world. Those gathered around the pool were sick, blind, lame, and withered. But those near the sea were not in such a condition. On the contrary, they were quite active and apparently they did not need mercy. They did not need the pool of Bethesda for their healing. As we shall see, the need of the people near the sea in John 6 was related to food, not to healing.<p>In John 5 we see the sick, blind, lame, and withered lying near a pool in Jerusalem. This is a picture of the fact that those in a pitiful condition are drawn to religion. They come to the traditional &#8220;pool&#8221; of religion for healing. If you are involved with religion, therefore, that is a strong indication that you are sick, lame, blind, or withered. In other words, you are impotent. All those under the porches near the pool of Bethesda were in such a condition. Would you like to be at the pool in Jerusalem with all the impotent ones, or would you rather be with the active ones around the sea in Galilee? Of course, we would prefer not to be at the pool but at the sea.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED FOR FOOD</h2><p>The crucial point here is that even though we may not be sick, blind, lame, or withered, we still are hungry. All those around the pool were sick, but those around the sea were hungry. The problem of those in Galilee was not impotence-their problem was the lack of food. They did not have anything to fill their hunger.<p>Humanly speaking, most people are not sick, but everyone needs food. The number of people going to supermarkets to buy food is far greater than the number of those in hospitals. Even though the majority of people are not sick, everyone has the need of food. Spiritually speaking, everyone is hungry. All those around the worldly, satanic sea, represented by the sea in Galilee, are hungry. The reason everyone is hungry is that all of them are short of Christ. If we do not have Christ, we shall be hungry. This is the most important sign we need to see in chapter six of the Gospel of John.<p>We do not realize how blind we have been concerning our need. Throughout the generations and the centuries human beings have been blind. Because of their blindness, they turn to religion with its ordinances, regulations, and rituals. People simply do not have any idea of what they really need. They do not know that they are short of Christ as their food. We do not need religion, and we do not need regulations and rituals. We need Christ to be our spiritual food.<h2 class=head2>An Illustration of Our Need</h2><p>In Exodus 34 we have an illustration of our need to feed on the Lord. That chapter is a record of the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the covenant that had been broken. In His mercy the Lord had come in to recover the covenant that had been broken by the idolatry of the children of Israel. That was the reason the Lord told Moses to hew out two tablets of stone and come up to the mountaintop to meet with Him. No doubt, Moses expected God to repeat the giving of the Ten Commandments and the ordinances. The Ten Commandments are in Exodus 20, and chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus are concerned with the ordinances. When God called Moses to come up to the mountaintop a second time with two tablets of stone, Moses must have thought that God&#8217;s intention was to recover the commandments and ordinances. However, God did not speak to Moses regarding the recovery of the covenant that had been broken, and He did not say anything about the Ten Commandments or the ordinances. Instead, God promised Moses that He would perform miracles in order to bring the people into the good land. Then He gave a warning concerning idolatry. Here the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;If you do not have idols but rather enjoy the riches of the good land, this enjoyment will cause the borders of the land to be enlarged. Furthermore, the enemies will be subdued and will not come to invade the land. The invaders will be kept from the land by your enjoyment of the riches of the land. But if you have idols instead of the enjoyment of the riches of the land, the enemies will come in to defeat you.&#8221;<p>According to the history in the Old Testament, when the children of Israel worshipped idols, the land was invaded by enemies, and the people were defeated. For example, because of their idolatry, the king of Babylon destroyed the temple and led the people away into captivity. But according to Exodus 34, if the people would have nothing to do with idols but rather enjoy the riches of the good land, the enemies would be kept from invading the land. The principle is the same in our spiritual experience today. If we do not enjoy Christ but instead have idols, we shall lose ground to the enemy. But if we enjoy Christ, this enjoyment will cause the borders of the good land to be enlarged, and it will keep the enemy away.<p>Moses went to the mountain to meet the Lord with the intention of having the broken covenant recovered. God, however, spoke to him about the feasts, the Sabbath, and about five conditions for feasting with the Lord. These five conditions are redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb, not offering the blood of the Lord&#8217;s sacrifice with leavened bread, not allowing the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover to remain until morning, bringing the first of the firstfruits to the house of God, and not boiling a kid in its mother&#8217;s milk. In our Life-study of Exodus we have covered in detail the spiritual significance of all these requirements in relation to feasting with the Lord and resting with Him (see Life-study of Exodus Messages 178 through 182). The important point here is that in Exodus 34 God&#8217;s concern was that His people would enjoy Him by feeding on Him. This was the reason He regarded these five requirements as important. These requirements are all related to our enjoyment of Christ by feasting and resting. However, both religious and nonreligious people alike fail to realize that their need is for food, for nourishment. God&#8217;s intention is that we feed on Christ.<h2 class=head2>Caring for Regulations instead of Enjoyment</h2><p>In their reading of the Bible, the majority of Christians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord by feeding on Him. Instead, they see laws, regulations, ordinances, ceremonies, rituals, forms, and practices. For example, in his reading of Ephesians 5 a brother may pay attention to Paul&#8217;s word about husbands loving their wives. Likewise, a sister may pay attention to the requirement that wives should be subject to their husbands. In both cases, Paul&#8217;s word in this chapter is taken as a regulation. The brother and the sister reading the book of Ephesians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord.<p>In John 5 all religious things are annulled. Not only are the things in the secular world annulled, but even all the things in the religious world are annulled. Consider chapter five and ask what religious thing has not been annulled. Everything, including the holy city, has been annulled. Moreover, according to this chapter, not even the holy Scriptures can give life apart from Christ.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Desire That We Take Him as the Tree of Life</h2><p>Chapter six indicates that we need food. Our unique need according to this chapter is for Christ as our food. After God created man, He particularly charged him to take care of his eating. Concerning man&#8217;s eating, God said, &#8220;Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat&#8221; (Gen. 1:29). The Lord also gave man a strict command concerning his eating: &#8220;And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it&#8221; (Gen. 2:16-17a). God&#8217;s desire was that man would take Him as food, as signified by the tree of life. Genesis 2:9 says, &#8220;And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden....&#8221; After creating man, God was concerned for man&#8217;s eating. In particular, God&#8217;s desire was that man would partake of Him as the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>FIVE BARLEY LOAVES AND TWO FISHES</h2><p>In chapter six of John we have the fulfillment of the eating of the tree of life. In this chapter the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five barley loaves and two fishes. In The All-inclusive Christ we point out that the significance of barley is different from that of wheat. Wheat signifies the incarnated Christ, and barley signifies the resurrected Christ. The number five signifies responsibility. Therefore, the five barley loaves here signify the resurrected Christ who is able to bear responsibility.<p>Barley, of course, is of the plant life. In typology, the plant life is for generating, for producing. The two fishes are of the animal life and signify the redeeming aspect of Christ&#8217;s life.<p>The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ&#8217;s life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life. As the generating life, Christ grew on the land, on the God-created earth. As the redeeming life, He lived in the sea, the Satan-corrupted earth. In order to regenerate us, He grew on the God-created earth for producing life. But in order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world. Just as fish can live in salty water but are not salty, so Christ could live in the sinful world without being sinful and without being affected by the world. In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the &#8220;death water&#8221; of the sinful world. It is significant, therefore, that the Lord Jesus fed the people with barley loaves and fishes. This indicates that He fed them with the generating life and the redeeming life, the life that overcomes death.<h2 class=head1>ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>Eventually, the feeding with Christ&#8217;s resurrection life and overcoming life results in eternal life. This is the reason the Lord speaks in this chapter concerning eternal life. In 6:27 He says, &#8220;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you.&#8221; In verse 40 He goes on to say, &#8220;For this is the will of My Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life.&#8221; In verse 47 the Lord says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&#8221; Therefore, eternal life definitely is emphasized in this chapter.<p>According to John 6:10, the number of men who were fed by the loaves and fishes was about five thousand. If the women and children are also counted, the total number could well have been ten thousand. However, the people who were fed failed to realize the significance of the Lord&#8217;s feeding. Instead, they were glad to have been fed by the Lord Jesus in such a marvelous way. That was the reason the next day a crowd gathered for the purpose of seeking Him. They wanted to experience the same thing again. But the Lord Jesus said to them, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the bread and were satisfied&#8221; (v. 26). This indicates that they did not see the significance of the sign.<p>The Lord went on to tell them not to work for the food which perishes, but to work for the food which abides to eternal life (v. 27). Here the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, &#8220;Do not seek for food that perishes. Instead, you should seek for eternal food, for food that abides forever.&#8221; What is this eternal food, or who is this food? The eternal food is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He came from the heavens not only to be our Savior-He also came to be our food. This means that He came to be the tree of life. What we need is Christ as the tree of life.<p>We do not realize to the fullest extent how much we need the Lord Jesus to be our daily food. Yes, we may talk somewhat about life. Nevertheless, we do not know how much we need Christ as our food.<h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>Chapter six of the Gospel of John is unique in giving many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. The Lord clearly says, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (vv. 35, 48). As the bread of life, He is the bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 41,50, 51, and 58), He is the bread of God (v. 33), He is the living bread (v. 51), and He is the true bread (v. 32). Here we have five characteristics of the Lord as our bread: heavenly bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the living bread, and the true bread. As the bread that came down out of heaven, He is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God. As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life, with zoe. As the living bread, He is living. The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living. As the true bread, Christ is the bread of truth or reality. Christ is true, real. He is the true food, and all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food. The physical food we take in every day is a shadow of Christ. The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ. Christ is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. We all need Christ to be the bread of life to us.<p>Even though you may hear many messages on life, you still may not be deeply impressed that you need Christ as your daily life supply. This is the reason we have been studying the Bible together in the way of life and giving messages that are called Life-study Messages. The burden in these messages is to point out that the Bible is not merely for teaching-the Bible is for life and life supply. We should not come to the Bible merely to seek teachings concerning commandments and regulations. Because the Bible is for life and life supply, we should come to it for food. The food we enjoy through the Word is the Lord Jesus Himself as the bread of life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 6:1-21, 26-69</h1><h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in John 6. In the foregoing message we pointed out that chapter six of the Gospel of John gives many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. We have seen five characteristics of the Lord as the bread of life. He is the heavenly bread (vv. 41, 50, 51, 58), the bread of God (v. 33), the bread of life (vv. 35, 48), the living bread (v. 51), and the true bread (v. 32). As the bread of life, Christ is the bread with eternal life, with zoe. As the true bread, the real bread, He is the reality of the food we eat daily. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. Therefore, through the Word we need to feed on Christ as the living bread.<p>In chapter six of the Gospel of John there are six sections related to Christ as the bread of life (6:32-71). In the first of these sections (vv. 32-51 a), we see that Christ, the bread of life, was incarnated. In verse 33 Christ refers to Himself as the bread of God, who came down out of heaven and gives life to the world. Although Christ is the very God, He became flesh in order to be the bread of life for us to eat.<p>In the second section we see that Christ was slain (vv. 51b-55). He was crucified. John 6:51b says, &#8220;And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&#8221; This refers to Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. The Lord gave His body, that is, His flesh, to die for us so that we may have life.<p>The third section concerning Christ as the bread of life points to His resurrection (vv. 56-59). In verse 56 the Lord says, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord had to be resurrected so that He may abide in us as our life and life supply.<p>In the fourth section (vv. 60-62) we have a word concerning the ascension of Christ. In verse 62 the Lord asked, &#8220;What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?&#8221; In verse 56 the Lord&#8217;s resurrection is implied. Here in this verse, His ascension, which follows His resurrection, is clearly mentioned. Ascension is the proof of the completion of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work (Heb. 1:3). In His ascension the Christ who came down out of heaven will go back to heaven.<p>In verses 63 through 65, the fifth section, we see that Christ became the life-giving Spirit. At the beginning of verse 63 the Lord says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life.&#8221; At this point, the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh (1:14), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45b. As the lifegiving Spirit, He can be life and the life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us. We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life.<p>In the last section we see that Christ as the bread of life is embodied in the word of life (vv. 66-71). Because He is embodied in the word of life, Simon Peter declared, &#8220;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&#8221; (v. 68).<h2 class=head1>THE PASSOVER</h2><p>In this chapter Christ first says that He is the bread of life. This bread of life is signified by barley loaves. However, eventually, the Lord went on to say that the bread which He gives is His flesh (v. 51). At this point, the bread is the flesh. The bread is of the vegetable life and is good for generating and nourishing, whereas the flesh is of the animal life and is good for nourishing and redeeming. In 6:53 and 54, the Lord Jesus goes on to speak of eating His flesh in order to have eternal life. In verse 55 He says, &#8220;My flesh is true food.&#8221; First, the Lord was typified by the vegetable (plant) life, the generating and nourishing life, and then He was typified by the animal life, the nourishing and redeeming life.<p>A verse near the beginning of chapter six says, &#8220;Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near&#8221; (v. 4). This indicates that the Passover was the background for what is recorded in John 6. With the Passover feast as the background, the Lord fed the multitude with the five loaves and the two fishes and then went on to speak concerning Himself as the bread of life. In the Passover people slay the redeeming lamb, strike its blood, and eat its flesh. This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood and thus take Him in as the life supply for us to live by. At the time of the Passover the Jewish people also eat unleavened bread. Here we have three basic elements of the Passover feast: first, the slaying of the lamb and the striking of its blood; second, the eating of the flesh of the lamb; third, the eating of unleavened bread. Therefore, we have the blood of the lamb, the flesh of the lamb, and unleavened bread. These three matters are found in the Lord&#8217;s discourse in John 6.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING THE LORD INTO OUR BEING</h2><p>For many years I was bothered by the Lord&#8217;s word in John 6 concerning drinking His blood (vv. 53-54, 56). At the time of the Passover the blood of the lamb was applied to the doorpost. But here the Lord Jesus speaks about drinking His blood. Eventually, the Lord showed me that to drink simply means to receive. Hence, to drink the blood is to receive it. The proper way to receive something into our stomach is by eating or by drinking. The significance of eating and drinking is to receive something into our being. To eat the Lord&#8217;s flesh and to drink His blood, therefore, is to receive the Lord&#8217;s flesh and blood into our being. To eat is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. The principle is the same with drinking.<p>Matthew 26:26-28 describes the establishing of the table by the Lord Jesus. According to Matthew 26:26, the Lord Jesus &#8220;took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body.&#8221; Then after taking the cup and giving thanks, He gave the cup to the disciples and said, &#8220;Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&#8221; (Matt. 26:27-28). To eat the Lord&#8217;s flesh, signified by the bread, and to drink His blood, signified by the cup, is to receive the crucified Christ, the One who was put to death for our sins in order that redemption could be accomplished. In this way we take Him and receive Him as our food for our nourishment.<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT EMBODIED IN THE WORD</h2><p>We have pointed out that, according to John 6, the crucified Christ was resurrected and ascended and became the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word. It is beyond the ability of our minds to comprehend such a wonderful One, One who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, who ascended to the heavens, and who has become the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.<p>Much of the teaching among Christians today fails to cover all the matters revealed in chapter six of John. Attention may be given to the Lord&#8217;s incarnation, His redemption, His resurrection, and His ascension. It is common for Bible teachers to point out that Christ was born of a virgin, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected, and that He ascended to the heavens. But many do not cover the last two sections concerning Christ in this chapter, the sections about Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit embodied in the word of life. But if we would receive the Lord Jesus as our bread of life, as our life supply to nourish us, we need to see that He is the life-giving Spirit and that this Spirit is embodied in the Word.<p>Among Christians there is not much argument concerning the Lord&#8217;s incarnation. Furthermore, there is not much argument concerning the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion. However, when they come to Christ&#8217;s resurrection and ascension, many Christians become somewhat unclear, and their understanding is vague. Some can only say that, according to the Scriptures, it was not possible for Christ to be held in Hades. Therefore, He came forth in resurrection, He ascended to the heavens, and He is now on the throne at the right hand of God. But if we stop with the matter of Christ&#8217;s ascension, what the Lord says in John 6 concerning eating His flesh and drinking His blood will be empty words as far as we are concerned, for there would be no way for us to experience them. If the Lord Jesus were not the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word, there would be no way for us to have eternal life by eating and drinking Him.<p>We have seen that the Lord Jesus said that His flesh is true food and His blood true drink (v. 55), that unless we eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood we cannot have life in ourselves (v. 53), and that if we eat Him we shall also live because of Him (v. 57). When many of the Lord&#8217;s disciples heard this word, they said, &#8220;This is a hard word; who can hear it?&#8221; (v. 60). They could not understand how it was possible for the Lord to give them His flesh to eat and His blood to drink. Some of the Jews could only say, &#8220;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, I have come down out of heaven?&#8221; (v. 42). We are also told that the Jews &#8220;contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&#8221; (v. 52). Likewise, to many Christians today, the Lord&#8217;s word concerning eating His flesh and drinking His blood is a hard word.<p>In 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; According to the context, &#8220;flesh&#8221; here refers to the meat of the physical body. Here the Lord explains that what He would give us to eat is not the meat of His physical body; the meat, which is the flesh, profits nothing. What the Lord gives us is the Spirit who gives life. We have seen that this Spirit is the Lord Himself in resurrection.<p>In 6:63 the Lord says that His words are spirit and life. Here the &#8220;words&#8221; follow the Spirit. The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious, intangible, and difficult for us to apprehend. However, the Lord&#8217;s words are substantial. First the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This indicates that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit who is life.<p>Many Christians are puzzled by the Lord&#8217;s word in verse 63. They do not know what it means for the Lord&#8217;s words to be spirit and life. Some Christians care only for the Bible in letters; they are reluctant even to talk about the Spirit. Their desire is merely to understand the Bible in letters. However, if we do not touch the Spirit in the Word, we cannot receive life. The Spirit is the extract of the Bible. Yet this extract is embodied in the Word. Today the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is embodied in the Word. Daily we may come to Him and touch Him as the Spirit in the Word. If we do this, we shall feed on Christ as the bread of life.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED FOR CHRIST AS OUR LIFE SUPPLY</h2><p>In our Christian life, we daily need the experience of contacting the Spirit in a practical way. We should not be satisfied merely to read a few chapters of the Bible each day or take a portion of the Word in morning watch. Whenever we come to the Word, we need to exercise our entire being, especially our spirit, to contact Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit. We definitely need to read the Bible. But it is crucial that we contact the Spirit in the Word by exercising our whole being. If we do this, we shall take in Christ as our food supply. We shall receive the Spirit as the heavenly manna.<p>We have seen that Christ is the bread of life, the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the living bread, and the true bread. Today this bread is not merely the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, but the Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit.<p>In chapter three of John we have the case of a religious gentleman, and in chapter four, the case of an immoral Samaritan woman. Then in chapter five we see that apart from Christ and without Christ everything is empty. The crucial point in chapter six is that we are hungry and need Christ as our food. Today this Christ is not merely the incarnated and crucified One, nor merely the resurrected and ascended One. He is now the life-giving Spirit. If we do not know our need and if we do not know what Christ is today, we shall be empty. We need Christ as our life supply, and today Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Day by day we should exercise our spirit to contact Him. Just as we have three meals every day, so we need to eat Christ as the bread of life again and again during the day. Even every moment we need to eat the One who is the Spirit who gives life. The One who is our Creator, Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master is the life-giving Spirit for us to contact all the time.<p>We are hungry and need food. Even though you may have been a Christian for many years, every day you are still hungry. Christ is not only your life; He is also your life supply, your daily food.<p>We all need Christ as He is revealed in chapter six of John. Yes, we have passed through chapters three, four, and five. But now in chapter six we are hungry ones around the sea in Galilee, and we need Christ as our life supply. We need Him to be our barley loaves and fish. We need Him as the generating life and the redeeming life. It is as the Spirit that Christ is this life to us. The Spirit who gives life is the generating life, the redeeming life, and the overcoming life. We need this Spirit as our life and life supply, as our food for daily nourishment. It is important that we all see this. I hope that we all shall be helped to realize our need for Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52</h1><p>In this message we come to chapter seven of the Gospel of John. Like all the other chapters of this Gospel, this chapter is very profound. But although it is profound, it is written in a human way.<h2 class=head1>THE YEARS OF THE LORD&#8217;S MINISTRY</h2><p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. This is seen by the fact that this Gospel has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts. John 2:13 says, &#8220;And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&#8221; This was the first feast of the Passover that took place during the years of the Lord&#8217;s ministry.<p>The ministry of the Lord Jesus lasted three and a half years. The Passover is held in the first month of the Jewish calendar year, the month of Abib. The Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover. According to Exodus 12, the Lord said to Moses concerning the month of Abib, &#8220;This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you&#8221; (v. 2). When the children of Israel observed the Passover for the first time, the Lord commanded them to regard that month as the beginning of a new year. Actually, that was not merely the beginning of a new year; it was the beginning of their history. In addition to the Passover, the children of Israel were to have six other annual feasts: the feasts of unleavened bread, firstfruit, weeks (Pentecost), trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles. These are the feasts which, according to the book of Leviticus, were to be held by the Jews throughout the centuries. John&#8217;s record concerning the Lord&#8217;s ministry was written according to the sequence of these feasts.<p>The last of the feasts mentioned in relation to the Lord&#8217;s life on earth was the Passover. At the time of the Passover, He was betrayed, judged, and crucified. It is helpful to realize that, according to the Jewish way of reckoning time, a new day begins in the evening. Thus, a day is counted as beginning not in the morning, but in the evening. The Lord Jesus was betrayed and judged during the night of His last day. Then in the morning, at nine o&#8217;clock, He was crucified, and He was on the cross for six hours, until three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.<p>From the Passover on which the Lord was crucified back to the Passover in chapter six of the Gospel of John is a period of one year. This was the last year of the Lord&#8217;s life on earth. From the Passover in John 6 back to the feast of Purim in chapter five is approximately another year in the Lord&#8217;s ministry. Then from the feast of Purim in chapter five back to the Passover feast in chapter two is yet another year. Before this Passover in John 2, the Lord had already been ministering for some months. This is the reason Bible students have calculated that the Lord&#8217;s ministry lasted for three and a half years.<p>Everything from verse 13 of chapter two through chapter four of the Gospel of John took place within the period of one year. As we have seen, in John 5 the feast of Purim is mentioned. This feast is held in the last month of the Jewish calendar year. In John&#8217;s record, there is no mention of anything that happened during the year between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the feast of the Passover in chapter six. The first Passover in John is in chapter two; the second is in chapter six; and the third is in chapter twelve. Between the Passover in chapter two and the feast of Purim in chapter five is one year. Between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the Passover in chapter six is another year. Then between the Passover in chapter six and that in chapter twelve is yet another year.<p>In the second part of chapter one we have a preliminary record regarding the Lord&#8217;s ministry. In this record we are told about John the Baptist. When John saw Jesus coming to him, he said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (1:29). John also testified and said, &#8220;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him&#8221; (v. 32). In this chapter we also read of the Lord&#8217;s contact with certain ones who became His disciples. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, the preliminary record in John 1, an introduction to the entire Gospel, contains six important signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. What is recorded in John 1 is a prologue, an introduction, to the following chapters. Then in the first part of chapter two the Lord changed water into wine (2:1-11). This was the beginning of signs and signifies life&#8217;s principle-changing death into life.<p>In the second part of chapter two a new year begins that covers chapters three and four. This year ends with the feast of Purim in chapter five. Thus, we have the Passover in the first month of this year, and the feast of Purim in the twelfth month of the year.<p>Let us now consider what happened during the first year of the Lord&#8217;s ministry according to the record in the Gospel of John. Following the sign of the changing of water into wine (2:1-11), at the beginning of the first year of the Lord&#8217;s ministry we see in 2:12-22 life&#8217;s purpose-building the house of God. These verses speak of Christ&#8217;s cleansing of the temple and also of the body of Jesus, the temple, being destroyed and raised up in resurrection. Therefore, in chapter two we have the principle of life and the purpose of life. The principle of life is to change death into life, and the purpose of life is to build the house of God.<h2 class=head1>A FULL VIEW OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>In chapter three we have the case of Nicodemus, an elderly religious gentleman. This chapter reveals that Nicodemus had a serpentine nature and that he needed to be replaced by Christ as the brass serpent in order to receive eternal life and thereby become part of the universal increase of Christ. The revelation here is deep and profound, and it requires much study.<p>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman. This woman did not have satisfaction in her human life, and she did not have the genuine worship of God. Therefore, Christ came to her that she might have satisfaction by drinking the living water and might know how to worship the Father in spirit and reality.<p>When we put together the two cases of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman, we have a full view of God&#8217;s salvation. God&#8217;s salvation is to replace our old man and redeem our sinful person so that we may be born again to have a new life, the eternal life, and thus become part of the increase of Christ. We shall have a source of satisfaction in our human life and also the way to worship God in reality. Both the source and the way are the Christ who is our Redeemer and Savior.<h2 class=head1>THE REAL FEAST OF PURIM</h2><p>We have seen that the background of chapter five was the feast of Purim and that the feast here was at the end of the first full year of the Lord&#8217;s ministry. The Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and there He enlivened the impotent man. By doing this the Lord indicated that He is the only one who can give life and that apart from Him the holy city, the holy temple, and all holy persons and holy things are nothing. Christ alone can cause us to have the real feast of Purim, a feast which indicates that we have passed out of death into life. We may say that the situation of the Jews at the time of the first feast of Purim was a passing out of death into life. With this feast as the background, the Lord Jesus said in 5:24, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&#8221; The significance of the record in John 5 is that nothing should replace Christ, for He is everything and only He can enliven us.<p>Following the record in chapter five, we have the second year of the Lord&#8217;s ministry, a year covering the time from the feast of Purim in chapter five to the Passover in chapter six. However, as we have indicated, the record in the Gospel of John does not say anything about what took place during this year.<h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>A new year, the third year of the Lord&#8217;s ministry, begins with the Passover in chapter six. The Passover includes redemption with the blood of the lamb and with the feeding on the lamb, the unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The main significance of the Passover in chapter six is eating. The people in John 6 were hungry and in need of food. They needed the feast of eating, the feast of Passover. But apart from Christ, the One who is prevailing in every way, even the Passover is empty. The crowd that gathered around the Lord was made up of empty people in need of food. The only One who could feed them is the One who is the bread of life, the living bread, the bread of God, the bread out of heaven, and the true bread. In chapter six all these terms describe Christ as the bread of life. The unleavened bread of the Passover was not the real bread; it was merely a shadow. The substance of that bread is Christ as the bread of life. He is the true bread from God who has come to be our life so that we may live.<h2 class=head1>THE LIVING BREAD</h2><p>Christ is not only the bread of life-He is also the living bread. The food we take into us enables us to live. The food we eat is organic and something of life. For example, vegetables, fruit, cereal, and meat are all organic, and they all come from living things. Because we eat living food, we also are living. This illustrates what the Lord meant when He said that He is the living bread. If we receive Him as this living bread, we shall live by Him. In 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; Here the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;I am the living bread out of heaven. If you eat this bread, I will be living in you, and you will live by Me.&#8221;<p>At the beginning of the new year in chapter six of John, we have the feast of Passover. But the food eaten during this feast is merely a shadow of Christ as the real food. He is the only One who can truly feed us and make us living.<h2 class=head1>THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES</h2><p>Between the Passover in chapter six and the feast of tabernacles in chapter seven is another period of time of almost a year concerning which nothing is recorded in this Gospel. The Passover was the first of the annual feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23, and the feast of tabernacles was the last (vv. 5, 34). Exodus 23:15 and 16 speak of three of the annual feasts: &#8220;Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread...and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field.&#8221; The feast of ingathering is the feast of tabernacles, held at the end of the year. The point here is that between the feast of Passover in John 6, held at the beginning of the year, and the feast of tabernacles in John 7, held at the end of the year, there is no record in John&#8217;s Gospel of anything that happened in the Lord&#8217;s ministry.<p>The feast of tabernacles is a feast for enjoyment and satisfaction. This feast can be compared to Thanksgiving as it is celebrated in the United States. The feast on Thanksgiving day is a feast of ingathering, a feast held at the end of the year after the crops have been harvested. The feast of tabernacles is also a feast of ingathering.<p>The feast of Passover signifies feeding, and the feast of tabernacles signifies satisfaction. The feeding at the Passover in John 6 was a shadow; it was not the real feeding. Likewise, the satisfaction at the feast of tabernacles in John 7 is also a shadow. Only Christ is the reality of both the feast of Passover and the feast of tabernacles.<p>At the end of the Bible we see an eternal tabernacle, the New Jerusalem. For eternity, we shall enjoy a feast of tabernacle. The New Jerusalem will be our tent, our tabernacle, where we shall have full enjoyment and full satisfaction. The river of living water will flow throughout the New Jerusalem for eternity. In eternity we shall have the full enjoyment of this feast.<h2 class=head1>FED AND SATISFIED BY CHRIST</h2><p>We have seen that in chapter five of John everything is annulled and only Christ remains as the available One and the availing One. Do you realize that, apart from Christ, nothing avails in human life? Your education and your employment are not availing. Everything except Christ is empty. Our need, then, is for Christ for our feeding and satisfaction. We do not need the holy city, the holy temple, or any other holy things. Furthermore, apart from Christ, not even the Bible is availing. According to the picture portrayed in chapters five, six, and seven of John, we need feeding and satisfaction. Who can feed us? Who can satisfy us? The Lord Jesus is the only One who can feed us and satisfy us.<p>We have just said that only the Lord Jesus can feed us and satisfy us. Now we need to ask what kind of Jesus can do this? In chapter six of John we have the incarnated and crucified Jesus. In chapter seven we have a Jesus who is not yet resurrected, not yet glorified (7:39). The living water was not available until He was resurrected, for in resurrection He changed His form to become the life-giving Spirit as the real river of water. From the day of His resurrection the river began to flow, and the full enjoyment of this river began at Pentecost, when the river came as a flood upon the disciples to satisfy them.<p>Through crucifixion and resurrection the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit. First He was the Savior and the Redeemer, and then He became the Spirit who gives life. In the first few verses of the Gospel of John we see that Christ was the Creator. Then through incarnation He became the Savior and the Redeemer. After His death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit, the very breath breathed into His disciples (20:22).<p>It is crucial for us to see that Christ has annulled everything and that only He Himself avails for our feeding and satisfaction. Because Christ is the bread of life as the living bread within us and because He is also the fountain of living water, He can feed us and satisfy us. Eventually, this fountain flows forth to become the river of living water. First Christ was the fountain, and now as the life-giving Spirit He is the river. In order for the fountain to flow, it had to be opened through Christ&#8217;s death. Christ was &#8220;cut&#8221; on the cross so that the fountain could become the life-giving Spirit as the flowing river to satisfy us.<h2 class=head1>HUNGRY AND THIRSTY</h2><p>In the scene in chapter six there was the feast of Passover. In the scene in chapter seven there is the feast of tabernacles. The feast of Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the feast of tabernacles is the last (Lev. 23:5, 34). The feast of Passover, at the first of the year, implies the beginning of man&#8217;s life (Exo. 12:2-3, 6), which involves man&#8217;s seeking for satisfaction and results in man&#8217;s hunger. The feast of tabernacles, as the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man&#8217;s life, which will end and result in man&#8217;s thirst. In the scene of the feast of Passover, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man&#8217;s hunger. In the scene of the feast of tabernacles, the Lord promises that He will flow forth as the living water, which quenches man&#8217;s thirst.<p>After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the feast of tabernacles to enjoy what they had reaped in the worship of God (Deut. 16:13-15). Hence, this feast signifies the completion, achievement, and success of man&#8217;s career, study, and other matters of human life, including religion, with the joy and enjoyment thereof.<p>With the Passover at the beginning of the year and the feast of tabernacles at the end, we see the beginning and end of human life. At the beginning of life, we are full of expectation, but we are also hungry. We may be hungry for a good education or a career. But eventually, when we come to the end of human life, we shall be thirsty. Young people, who are full of expectation, are hungry. But the older ones, who are at the end of human life, are thirsty. Young people may expect to have a high education and a promising career. Their hunger will continue throughout life. However, when they come to the end of their life, they will realize that they are thirsty, that they are not satisfied. Therefore, we need the Lord Jesus as both the living bread to feed us and the fountain of living water to satisfy us. We may say that, in particular, at the beginning of human life He is our food, and at the end, He is the river of living water.<p>As an elderly person, I am no longer at the beginning of my human life. However, I can testify that I am not thirsty. On the contrary, I am filled with living water and overflowing with it, for I enjoy the Lord, who is the life-giving Spirit, as my satisfaction. Because this living water fills me to overflowing, I am able to water others so that they may be satisfied.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST FOR NOURISHMENT AND SATISFACTION</h2><p>The Gospel of John has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts. In chapters two, six, and twelve, we have the Passover; in chapter five, the feast of Purim; and in chapter seven, the feast of tabernacles. We have pointed out that the feast of Passover, the first of the Jewish annual feasts, implies the beginning of man&#8217;s life and that the feast of tabernacles, the last feast of the year, implies the completion of life. In the scene in chapter six there is the feast of Passover. In this chapter the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life to satisfy man&#8217;s hunger. In the scene in chapter seven there is the feast of tabernacles. Here the Lord says, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (v. 37). Furthermore, the Lord promised that the one who believes in Him will experience rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being (v. 38). Here we have the living water to quench man&#8217;s thirst.<p>The feast of Passover is related to man&#8217;s hunger, and the feast of tabernacles, to man&#8217;s thirst. At the beginning of life we are hungry, but at the end of life we are thirsty. Therefore, we need the Lord Jesus as the living bread to feed us and as the living water to satisfy us. The feast of Passover signifies nourishment, and the feast of tabernacles signifies satisfaction. However, both the eating at the Passover in John 6 and the satisfaction at the feast of tabernacles in John 7 are shadows. Christ is the reality of both the feast of Passover and the feast of tabernacles. Therefore, we need Christ for our nourishment and satisfaction. Because He is the living bread within us and also the fountain of living water, He can feed us and satisfy us.<p>The feast of tabernacles, held at the end of the year with the ingatherings of the harvest, was for the people&#8217;s full enjoyment and satisfaction. However, those who attended this feast were not satisfied. This was the reason that &#8220;on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (7:37). The Lord cried out in this way because He realized that none of those attending the feast were satisfied. Year after year, they came to the feast of tabernacles, but they were not satisfied. Hence, the Lord called the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink. The &#8220;last day&#8221; in verse 37 signifies that all the enjoyment of any success of human life will end. There is a last day to every kind of material thing in human life. But in eternity the feast of tabernacle in the New Jerusalem will never end. That is the only feast that will last forever.<h2 class=head1>A LIFE RESTRICTED FOR GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE</h2><p>It is actually quite difficult for us to grasp the thought in chapter seven of John. It is easier to understand chapters three, four, five, and six than it is to understand this chapter. In John 1 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb with the Dove. Concerning Him, John the Baptist said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (v. 29). John also testified, &#8220;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him&#8221; (v. 32). The fact that Jesus is the Lamb with the Dove indicates that He is the One who redeems us and puts us into the Spirit. In chapter two the Lord Jesus changed water into wine. That was the first of signs (2:11) and signifies life&#8217;s principle-changing death into life. In 2:12-22 we see life&#8217;s purpose-to build the house of God. Therefore, in John 2 we have the changing of death into life for the building up of God&#8217;s dwelling place. In 3:14 and 15 the Lord said to Nicodemus, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.&#8221; In this chapter Christ is the brass serpent, having the form of a serpent but not its poisonous nature, lifted up to die for us so that we may be regenerated with the divine life in order to become part of His increase. In chapter four Christ is the fountain of living water and also the reality of all the offerings. In chapter five Christ is the One to whom judgment has been given and the One who gives life. Then in chapter six Christ is the bread of life, the true, living bread out of heaven, to feed hungry people.<p>In chapters three through six we are clearly told what Christ is doing or what He is about to do. The situation is very different in chapter seven. In this chapter we do not have the record of any kind of doing or activity. What we see here is a certain kind of life. Chapter seven reveals a life that is restricted for God&#8217;s purpose. In this chapter we see that the Lord lived in such a way that He was restricted from doing anything for Himself. For example, the Lord&#8217;s brothers, who did not believe in Him, said to Him, &#8220;Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you are doing; for no one does anything in secret and seeks himself to be known in public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world&#8221; (7:3-4). The Lord&#8217;s brothers seemed to be saying, &#8220;Since you are able to do miracles, why not show yourself openly and get a name for yourself? Don&#8217;t do things in secret. Go to Jerusalem and do something in public. That will cause you to become a great leader.&#8221; The brothers of the Lord followed man&#8217;s way, the way of self-glorification. But the Lord Jesus followed God&#8217;s way and said to them, &#8220;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready&#8221; (v. 6). Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here as a man, limited even in the matter of time.<p>In 7:7 and 8 the Lord went on to say to His brothers, &#8220;The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet fully come.&#8221; The Lord Jesus seemed to be telling His brothers, &#8220;I cannot do things in the way of glorifying man. You may act that way, for you are worldly people living for yourselves. But because I am not a worldly person and I am not living for Myself, I cannot follow that way. Also, I need to be careful because the Jews are seeking to kill Me. But My time, the time of My death, has not yet come.&#8221; The Lord knew that what was written in the Scriptures would be fulfilled at the feast of Passover, not at the feast of tabernacles. Hence, it was necessary for Him to be careful until the time had come for Him to be crucified. He knew that He would be put to death on the Passover and then resurrected on the feast of firstfruit. After that, He would become the reality of the feast of Pentecost for His disciples.<p>As the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover. Then on the third day, the day of the firstfruit, He was resurrected. Following that, He remained with His disciples for forty days, after which He ascended to the heavens. Then the disciples prayed for ten days. This means that after a total of fifty days, there was the feast of Pentecost, and the Lord became the full harvest. The point here is that the Lord Jesus lived a life restricted for God. Living such a restricted life, He knew that He was not to die at the feast of tabernacles, but at the feast of Passover. For this reason, in chapter seven He was very careful about going up to Jerusalem for the feast.<h2 class=head1>SEEKING GOD&#8217;S GLORY FOR GOD&#8217;S SATISFACTION</h2><p>As One who lived a restricted life, a life restricted from doing things for self, the Lord sought the glory of God for God&#8217;s satisfaction. When the Lord Jesus taught in the temple, the Jews marveled and said, &#8220;How does this man know letters, having never learned?&#8221; (v. 15). The Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him&#8221; (vv. 16-18). Here we see that the Lord did not seek His own glory, in that He did not speak from Himself. Rather, He sought the glory of the One who sent Him.<p>The Lord&#8217;s being a person who sought God&#8217;s glory for God&#8217;s satisfaction did not depend on what He did or on His works; it depended instead on the fact that He was of God, that He was sent by God, that He came from God, and that He spoke God. This chapter does not record any work done by the Lord Jesus. This chapter reveals that He was a person restricted by God, that He was of God, that He was sent by God and came from God, and that He did not speak His own word but spoke God. When the Lord spoke God&#8217;s word, God was expressed through His speaking. God came forth from Him through His words.<h2 class=head1>QUALIFIED TO BE THE BURNT OFFERING</h2><p>Because the Lord lived a life of restriction and a life of seeking the glory of God, He was fully qualified to be the burnt offering. In the book of Leviticus we have five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The burnt offering is unique in that it is not mainly for redemption. The burnt offering is wholly for God&#8217;s satisfaction. According to Leviticus 1, this offering was burned to ashes as God&#8217;s food to satisfy God. In chapter seven of the Gospel of John we see that the Lord Jesus is the reality of the burnt offering. He lived a life that was wholly restricted by God and for God. He was of God, He came from God, and He was sent by God.<p>Although John 7 does not record the Lord&#8217;s works, it does give us an account of His speaking. In this chapter the Lord seemed to be saying to the religionists, &#8220;You do not understand My word because you are not in My kingdom. In My kingdom I live a life that is restricted from doing things for the self. I live such a restricted life for God. I live a life of speaking God and of expressing Him for His glory and satisfaction. But you do everything for your own glory. This proves that you are in another kingdom. But if you have a will to do God&#8217;s will, if you have the desire to please God, then you will understand My word and know concerning My teaching whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself. If you decide to live a life for God, you will immediately understand My word.&#8221;<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the religious people were busy doing things for their own glory. The situation is the same in principle among religious people today. In the religious sphere people are active; they are very busy doing all sorts of things. But who is living a life restricted by God and expressing Him? Who is seeking God&#8217;s glory for His satisfaction? It is rare to find such a living among Christians today. Because most Christians do not live a life of restriction and a life of seeking God&#8217;s glory for His satisfaction, they are not able to understand John 7. If we would understand this chapter, we need to be those who are willing to be restricted and seek God&#8217;s glory. This is a life for the burnt offering.<h2 class=head1>SLANDERED AND PERSECUTED</h2><p>As the One who lived a life for the burnt offering, the Lord Jesus even seemed to be misleading in speaking with His brothers. First, He told them that He was not going up to the feast (v. 8). But &#8220;when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not publicly, but as in secret&#8221; (v. 10). Some of those at the feast claimed that He was leading the crowd astray (v. 12). This indicates that He was criticized and accused of misleading people.<p>In John 7 the Lord Jesus was also slandered and persecuted. The Lord said to the crowd, &#8220;Has not Moses given you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill Me?&#8221; (v. 19). Then the crowd replied, &#8220;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?&#8221; (v. 20). Some even went so far as to slander the Lord by saying that He had a demon. Furthermore, according to 7:25, some were seeking to kill Him, and verse 30 indicates that they were seeking to seize Him. This proves that the Lord Jesus, the One who lived the life for the burnt offering, was slandered and persecuted.<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE THAT SATISFIES AND OVERFLOWS</h2><p>In this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus is the One who satisfies the thirsty and overflows from within them as rivers of living water (vv. 37-39). Not only does He live for God and satisfy God, but He also satisfies the thirsty ones who come to Him and overflows from within them.<p>Many Christians can testify that when they were first saved they experienced the Lord overflowing from within them. However, after a period of time that flowing ceased. Do you know why? This flowing ceases in many Christians because they do not live a life that is qualified to be the burnt offering for God&#8217;s satisfaction. Only the kind of life that satisfies God can cause others to be satisfied. Because the Lord Jesus lives a life restricted by God and a life seeking God&#8217;s glory for His satisfaction, He can quench our thirst, satisfy us, and overflow from within us.<p>Now that we have the Lord within us as such a life, we need to live Him. This means that we should live a life restricted by God from doing things for ourselves and also live a life that seeks God&#8217;s glory for His satisfaction. When we live this kind of life, spontaneously the fountain of life will spring up within us and overflow.<h2 class=head1>PERSECUTED BY RELIGION</h2><p>In John 7 we see the persecution by religion of the life that is restricted by God and seeks God&#8217;s glory. Religious people cannot understand such a life. To them, such a life is nonsensical. The persecution in this chapter took place at the time of religion&#8217;s holy feast. While they were holding a feast for their enjoyment, they were plotting to kill the Lord Jesus, and this was done according to their Scriptures. They claimed that they wanted to act in a scriptural way, and they charged others to search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee (v. 52). Furthermore, the religious ones who persecuted the Lord Jesus did so with the pride of knowing their holy law. Concerning this pride, verse 49 quotes the words of the Pharisees, who said, &#8220;This crowd which does not know the law is accursed.&#8221; They were proud of their knowledge of the law. In principle, the situation is the same today. Much of the persecution we have encountered has come from religious people who seek to act according to their regulations and according to their interpretation of the Scriptures.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE FEASTS</h2><p>In this message our emphasis certainly is not on religion&#8217;s persecution; it is on Christ, the reality of the feast of tabernacles. Today we are enjoying a foretaste of this feast. In the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the full taste with the unique tabernacle and the river of water of life. Today we enjoy Christ as the Passover, as the One who feeds us, and we are also at the real feast of tabernacles, enjoying Christ as the river of living water that satisfies us and overflows from within us. Therefore, we are fed and satisfied. But all this is simply a foretaste. In the New Jerusalem in eternity we shall enjoy this feast forever.<p>Christ is the reality of all the feasts. He is our feast of Passover, unleavened bread, firstfruit, Pentecost, and tabernacles. Christ is everything to us. Therefore, He is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. As the One we enjoy today, Christ is the fulfillment of all these types. How wonderful it is that we may enjoy such a Christ!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 8</h1><h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB</h2><p>The Gospel of John is a record showing us the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. As we have pointed out, in the first chapter of this Gospel we have the tabernacle and the Lamb of God. John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; Christ is God incarnated to tabernacle among men. In 1:14 the word &#8220;tabernacled&#8221; is used as a verb. According to this verse, Christ Himself was the tabernacle dwelling among men. Hence, He is a living tabernacle. In 1:29 John the Baptist said of Christ, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; Here we see that the Christ who was incarnated to be the living tabernacle is also the Lamb of God. The Lamb of God is the aggregate, the totality, of all the offerings. Therefore, in two verses, verses 14 and 29 of John 1, we have the words tabernacle and Lamb. These terms indicate that the Gospel of John covers the matters of the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Chapter one of the Gospel of John is a prologue or introduction to the entire book. This means that what is mentioned in the first chapter of John is defined and developed in the remainder of the book. The fact that in the prologue we have the tabernacle and the Lamb of God indicates that John in his Gospel intends to unveil the tabernacle and the Lamb of God. For this reason, we say that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.<p>In the book of Revelation, which is the conclusion of the Bible, we can also see the tabernacle and the Lamb. Revelation 21:3 says, &#8220;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.&#8221; As God&#8217;s habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God for eternity. The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle, and that type was fulfilled in Christ as God&#8217;s tabernacle among men. Eventually, that type will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>Within the eternal tabernacle of God, that is, within the New Jerusalem, the Lamb of God will be on the throne (Rev. 22:1). Revelation 5:6 says that in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, there was a Lamb standing as having been slain. This book mentions the Lamb many other times (5:12; 6:1; 7:9-10, 14, 17; 12:11; 14:1, 4; 19:7, 9; 21:22). Therefore, in the book of Revelation we have both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God. This is a further indication that John&#8217;s writings are a record of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIVERSAL REALITY</h2><p>We need a clear view of the Bible as a whole. The Bible is a record of the universal reality. Anything that does not have reality is empty, vain. For example, if we had only a physical body but did not have an inner being, we would be empty, altogether lacking in reality. Our inner being is our reality. If we had only a body with skin, flesh, and bone, we would have a &#8220;shell,&#8221; but we would not have reality.<p>If the universe does not have a reality, then the entire universe is a shell. For there to be no reality in the universe would mean that the universe would not have any content. If the universe were merely a shell, there would be nothing but emptiness and vanity. King Solomon said, &#8220;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&#8221; (Eccl. 1:2). He said that everything under the sun is vanity. It is true that if we do not have the content or reality of the universe, everything will be vanity.<p>Now we need to go on to ask what the content of the universe is. Philosophers and other thoughtful people cannot answer this question. It is hard for anyone to tell you what the content, the reality, of the universe is.<p>Some among us may say that the reality of the universe is Christ. However, this may be merely a doctrine to us. A doctrine is not reality; rather, it is also a shell. We may compare doctrine to a menu. A menu is a description of food, but it is not the food itself. Only the food, not the menu, is the reality. When you go to a restaurant, you go there for food, for reality; you do not go for the menu. To say that the reality of the universe is Christ may simply be a doctrine, a menu; it may not be the reality, the food. However, I definitely agree with those who say that Christ is the reality of the universe. But in what sense is Christ this reality? It also may merely be a doctrine to say that the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit is the reality of the universe. This may be a doctrine that you learned in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. As we shall see, according to the record of the Holy Word, the reality of the universe is actually the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>What is recorded in the Bible from Genesis through Revelation? We may say that in the Bible we have God, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the New Jerusalem. This, of course, is correct. But if we get into the depths of the truth revealed in the Bible, we shall see that in these depths we have the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head1>A MUTUAL ABODE</h2><p>The tabernacle is God&#8217;s dwelling place. However, it is not adequate to say that the tabernacle is merely a dwelling for God. Actually the tabernacle is a universal dwelling place for both God and man. Consider the New Jerusalem. Will God be the only one dwelling in the New Jerusalem? No, God and all His redeemed people will be dwelling in the New Jerusalem. Hence, it will be a dwelling place for both God and man. This dwelling place is a mutual abode, a mutual dwelling place.<p>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; Here the word &#8220;abode&#8221; is used. The abode here is actually a mutual abode. We abide in the Lord, and He abides in us.<p>For there to be a mutual abode, the Lord must first become our dwelling place. When we abide in Him, He surely is our abode. Then as He abides in us, we are His abode. The Lord speaks concerning this mutual abode when He says in 15:4, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; Therefore, the Lord is our dwelling place, and we become His dwelling place. The New Jerusalem will be such a mutual dwelling place, a place where we shall abide in God and He will abide in us. Even today we may experience the mysterious fact of abiding in the Lord and the Lord abiding in us. Our real home is the Lord. The Lord is our dwelling place, and we dwell in Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY INTO THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The content or reality of the universe is this mutual abode, this mutual dwelling place for God and man. The word that describes this dwelling place is the tabernacle. But how can we, sinful human beings, dwell together with God and even dwell in God, who is holy and righteous? It is only by the offerings that we can dwell in the holy and righteous God.<p>It is helpful to consider the picture of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament. According to chapter forty of Exodus, when the tabernacle was erected, God&#8217;s glory descended upon it and filled it. What a glorious scene that was! In this scene God was camping among His people. Although He was in the heavens, He came down to dwell in a tent among the children of Israel. How could sinful people come into God&#8217;s tent? The only way they could enter the dwelling place of God was through the offerings. Therefore, before anyone could come into the tabernacle, he had to come to the altar and offer the sacrifices required by God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory.<p>As sinners, we cannot fulfill the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. But God has prepared the offerings. According to Leviticus, the main offerings are the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In addition, there are the wave offering, the heave offering, and the freewill offerings. By means of these offerings the problems between us and God can be solved. When the offering comes, the problem goes. Hence, by means of the offerings we may enter God&#8217;s dwelling place and meet with Him, eat with Him, converse with Him, and enjoy Him.<p>As we enjoy God, He enjoys us. We may use family life as an illustration. On the one hand, children enjoy the parents; on the other hand, parents enjoy the children. We may say that the children&#8217;s enjoyment of the parents becomes the parents&#8217; enjoyment. Likewise, when we come into the tabernacle through the offerings, we enjoy God, and He enjoys us.<h2 class=head1>THE INCARNATED GOD</h2><p>Now we can see that the reality of the universe is the tabernacle and the offerings. It is true to say that both the tabernacle and the offerings are Christ. However, we need to go on to speak in a more detailed way and say that the tabernacle is God incarnated, and Christ is the incarnated God. Furthermore, as the Lamb of God, Christ is all the offerings. God manifested in the flesh is Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God. The content, the reality, of the entire universe is God incarnate, God becoming a man. Jesus Christ, the God-man, is the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Jesus Christ is both God and man. As the God-man, He is the tabernacle to be the dwelling place for God and man. He is also the offerings for man to enter into God. This One, who is both the tabernacle and the offerings, is the reality and content of the universe.<h2 class=head1>THE EXTRACT OF THE LAST ADAM</h2><p>How can the tabernacle and the offerings, which are the reality of the universe, be realized by us and enjoyed by us? First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; Here we have the last Adam and the life-giving Spirit. Who is the last Adam? The last Adam is God incarnated to become a man. The first Adam was simply and merely a man. But the last Adam is the God-man, One who has both divinity and humanity. The last Adam is God manifested in the flesh and God mingled with humanity. He is Adam, but He is Adam with the divine nature and also the divine Person. Therefore, the One who is the last Adam is nothing less than God Himself. But He is God with humanity, God with the flesh. Eventually, this One who is the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.<p>The life-giving Spirit is the extract of the last Adam. In the first message of this series on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, we pointed out that an extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is &#8220;spirit,&#8221; which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance. In a similar manner, the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and now the life-giving Spirit is the extract of the last Adam.<p>Suppose a certain kind of herb is useful in healing a particular illness. How can that herb be applied to a sick person? The best way is to take out the extract of that herb and use it to make medicine. Then a sick person simply needs to take this medicine. There is no need for him to eat the herb. We may use this as an illustration of the life-giving Spirit as the extract of the last Adam, God in the flesh. Just as herbs need to pass through a process in order for an extract to be brought forth, so the last Adam, the God-man, had to pass through a process in order to become the life-giving Spirit. Just as herbs may be pressed to produce the extract, so the last Adam was &#8220;pressed&#8221; on the cross. He certainly passed through the process of death and resurrection.<p>Chapter fifteen of 1 Corinthians is concerned with resurrection. It was through resurrection that the last Adam was made an extract, an extract that is the life-giving Spirit. Of course, resurrection was preceded by death. Hence, through death and resurrection the last Adam became the omnipresent life-giving Spirit.<p>Because the Spirit is everywhere, we can contact Him simply by exercising our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. In this way we enjoy Him as the Lamb of God, as the all-inclusive offering. Then through Him as the offerings we enter into Him as the tabernacle. How marvelous!<p>The content of the record of the Bible is the Triune God passing through a process to become the tabernacle, a mutual abode for God and man. Now we may dwell in Him and He in us through Himself as the offerings. This is the content of the Bible and the reality of the universe.<p>The Gospel of John is the condensation of the whole Bible. In this book we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. The reality of the universe is the Triune God as the tabernacle and the offerings, and this reality is the content of the Bible. The whole Bible is condensed into one book, the Gospel of John. Therefore, in the record of this Gospel we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 8</h1><h2 class=head1>A REVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN</h2><p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. From 1:1 and 14 we see that the eternal God became a man. This took place in time, not in eternity. This incarnated God, God in the flesh, is the tabernacle. This One is also the Lamb of God. Both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God are signs. According to 1:32, John the Baptist testified of Christ, saying, &#8220;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.&#8221; Here we see that the Dove is upon the Lamb. Later, when Simon was brought to the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, &#8220;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone)&#8221; (1:42). This stone is also a sign. In 1:51 the Lord said to Nathaniel that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. Here we see that the Son of Man is the heavenly ladder, and this ladder is related to Bethel, the house of God.<p>In chapter one we have the incarnated God as the tabernacle and the Lamb. Through the Lamb we have the Dove, the Spirit, by whom we become stones for the building of God&#8217;s house. Therefore, chapter one begins with the eternal Word and issues in Bethel, the house of God. This is the extract of chapter one of John.<p>In chapter two we have the sign of changing water into wine. As we have pointed out, this signifies changing death into life. In this chapter we also have the sign of the raising up of the destroyed temple. This sign indicates that in resurrection God&#8217;s dwelling place is enlarged.<p>In chapter three an elderly, respected, learned gentleman comes to the Lord Jesus. The Lord indicated that even such a person has a serpentine nature and needs Christ, the incarnated One, to die on the cross as his substitute for his redemption. Furthermore, the Lord indicated in this chapter that this gentleman needed to be regenerated in order to become part of the bride as Christ&#8217;s universal increase.<p>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman. Although she was not satisfied in her human life, she pretended to worship God. But her worship was not genuine. Therefore, the Lord Jesus told her that He is the fountain of living water to satisfy her and also the reality for her to worship God.<p>In chapter five the impotent man, who had been ill for thirty-eight years, was enlivened. In this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus annulled all religious things, such as the holy city and the pool of Bethesda. According to the revelation in this chapter, nothing and no one should replace Christ. Only He avails to enliven us. Not even the Scriptures can convey life to us apart from Him. Therefore, we need to come to Him for life.<p>After the Lord annulled the religious things in chapter five, He presented Himself as the bread of life to the hungry ones in chapter six. As the bread of life, the living and true bread of God that came down from heaven, He can nourish us.<p>In chapter seven we see that the Lord Jesus is the living water to quench our thirst. In 7:37 He cried out and said, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>SIN, DARKNESS, AND DEATH</h2><p>With this review in mind, we may go on to consider the signs in chapter eight. Have you ever studied chapter eight in the Recovery Version of John? If not, I urge you to study this chapter, paying careful attention to the outline and the notes.<p>In chapters eight through eleven of John&#8217;s Gospel three negative things are dealt with: sin, blindness, and death. Sin is dealt with in chapter eight; blindness, which is spiritual darkness, is dealt with in chapters nine and ten; and death is dealt with in chapter eleven. Although we have been regenerated, have been transformed to some extent, have had our hunger satisfied by the Lord as the bread of life, and have had our thirst quenched by the living water, we still have the problems of sin, darkness, and death. How can we overcome these negative things? How can they be dealt with in our daily living? In the first seven chapters of John we have a picture of how we have been regenerated, satisfied, and supplied with living water. As a result, we may be quite happy. However, we still need chapters eight through eleven to show us how we can overcome the three problems of sin, darkness, and death.<h2 class=head1>A BOOK OF SIGNS</h2><p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs. In this Gospel John does not speak of miracles; instead, he uses the word &#8220;signs.&#8221; For example, the feeding of the five thousand is a sign that the Lord Jesus is the only One who can truly feed us and that He feeds us with Himself as the bread of life. This bread is the bread of God, the true bread, the living bread, the bread that came down from heaven. Therefore, the feeding of the multitude in chapter six is a sign of the Lord feeding us with Himself as the true bread. As we shall see, the story recorded in chapter eight of John is also a sign.<p>When I was young, the account of the woman caught in adultery and brought to the Lord by the scribes and Pharisees was merely a story. However, this is not merely a story, an account of certain facts; it is also a sign.<h2 class=head1>SLAVES OF SIN</h2><p>The sign in 8:1-11 indicates that every human being is a slave of sin. When some hear this, they may say that they are not like the woman in this chapter because they have never committed fornication. Do not be quick to respond in this way. Do you know what the significance of fornication is in the Bible? According to the Bible, fornication means that a person gives up God and goes after other things. Fornication is thus a matter of departing from the way ordained by God.<p>God has ordained that regarding married life there should be one husband for one wife, and one wife for one husband. Furthermore, married life is a shadow, a figure, of the relationship between God and man. God is the real Husband, the universal Husband, and we human beings, both male and female, are in the position of the wife. This means that God is the Husband, and humanity is His wife. After God created Adam, He said, &#8220;It is not good that the man should be alone&#8221; (Gen. 2:18). In typology this indicates that it is not good for God to be alone. God desires a counterpart, and His counterpart is man. Hence, man was created by God and for God. This means that man must be for God. But if man is not for God, according to the significance before God, that is fornication.<p>In the Bible fornication is related to idolatry. Idolatry is spiritual fornication. In the Old Testament the children of Israel committed fornication before God in their high places, in the places where they worshipped idols. Their worship of idols was fornication, and that was abominable in the sight of God.<p>To go after something else in place of God is fornication. Because we all have left God to pursue other things, in His sight we all are females who have committed spiritual fornication. This means that in the case of fornication in chapter eight of the Gospel of John is a sign of spiritual fornication. Before God, we all are fornicators, and we all are slaves of sin.<h2 class=head1>CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL</h2><p>As slaves of sin, we are children of the Devil born of fornication (8:44, 41). In this chapter the Jews claimed that God was their Father. They said to the Lord Jesus, &#8220;We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God&#8221; (v. 41). But the Lord Jesus told them, &#8220;You are of your father the Devil&#8221; (v. 44). As sons of the Devil, they were born of fornication.<p>In the Bible fornication signifies a relationship that is illegal in the sight of God. The children of Israel had an illegal relationship with the Devil, and God regarded that relationship as fornication. Those who were born of that illegal relationship were children of the Devil. The principle is the same with us. As fallen human beings, we all are children of the Devil and in this sense were born of fornication. Therefore, we possess a devilish nature, and for this reason we are slaves of sin.<p>Because we were born of the Devil, we have his evil nature. The sins we commit are the outward expression of this nature. Sin is an act that expresses the devilish nature. It is an issue of the devilish nature within us.<p>Let us use fruit trees as an illustration. A peach tree brings forth peaches, and an apple tree produces apples. The bearing of such fruit is the expression of the inward nature of the trees. It is impossible for a peach tree to produce apples, or for an apple tree to produce peaches. A peach tree bears peaches according to its nature, and an apple tree bears apples according to its nature. The principle is the same with our committing sin. Why do we lie, and why do we hate? We lie and hate because we have the nature of the Devil, Satan, within us.<p>Chapter eight of John speaks of murder, lying, and hatred. All these things are related to Satan. Satan is a murderer and a liar, even the father of liars. Satan is also the one who hates.<p>These sins are prohibited by the Ten Commandments. The first four of these commandments are related to God, and the last six are related to humanity. According to the Ten Commandments, we are forbidden to murder and to lie by bearing false witness. However, who among us can say that he has never lied or never hated someone?<p>When the scribes and Pharisees brought to the Lord the woman caught in adultery, they said to Him, &#8220;Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons. What then do you say?&#8221; (v. 5). Their intention was to challenge the Lord. But the Lord said to them, &#8220;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&#8221; (v. 7). The Lord&#8217;s word touched their conscience. &#8220;When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones until the last&#8221; (v. 9).<p>This sign indicates that, no matter what kind of person we may be, we are all slaves of sin because we have the nature of sin. We have a devilish nature, the nature of the Devil. Because we have a devilish nature, we hate and lie. Because we have a sinful nature, we commit sin.<h2 class=head1>CONDEMNED BY THE LAW</h2><p>As those who commit sin, we are condemned by the law, and we are also under God&#8217;s condemnation (v. 11). In this chapter the law is represented by Moses. According to the law, we should be stoned to death for our sins. The law, therefore, condemns us to death. Furthermore, as those under God&#8217;s condemnation, our destiny as fallen people was to die in our sins (8:21, 24).<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY AND THE EMANCIPATOR</h2><p>Some may say that because they are saved, they are no longer slaves of sin. Doctrinally speaking, this is true. But in our actual experience we may still be slaves of sin. Whether or not we have been freed from the slavery of sin depends on how much the dear Lord Jesus is to us. Therefore, we need to consider from this chapter what this precious One is to us.<p>In this chapter the Lord Jesus indicates that He is the reality and the emancipator. In verse 32 He says, &#8220;And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free.&#8221; Then in verse 36 He goes on to say, &#8220;If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free.&#8221; To be set free by the reality is to be emancipated. If we compare verses 32 and 36, we shall see that the Son of God is the reality. Verse 32 says that reality sets us free, and verse 36, that the Son sets us free. This indicates that the Son is the reality that sets us free.<p>What does it mean to say that the Son of God is the reality that sets us free? In the previous message we pointed out that we may say that the reality of the universe is Christ. However, to say this may be to utter something vague and ambiguous. We need to see that the reality here is related to God incarnate, to the eternal God becoming a man.<p>In verse 28 the Lord Jesus speaks of the lifting up of the Son of Man, not of the Son of God. As we shall see, in verse 58 the Lord indicates that He is the I Am. In order for the Son of God to be the reality that frees us from sin, He had to be incarnated. He had to be a man. If He had not become a man, He could not be the reality, and He could not set us free. The universal reality is God incarnate, the eternal God becoming a man. This incarnated God is both the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings. Therefore, the reality in chapter eight includes the eternal God incarnated to be a man, and this Man is the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings. This is the reality that sets us free.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN ACTUALITY AND PRACTICALITY</h2><p>The Christ whom we enjoy today is this reality. He is God incarnate to be the tabernacle and the offerings. The Christ we enjoy is One who includes God, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This One even includes His descent as the Spirit. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, today in His extract this Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Do we not have this life-giving Spirit within us? We all need to realize that today Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit. The power to overcome sin is in this extract, in this life-giving Spirit. We need to see that the life-giving Spirit is the actual and practical Christ.<p>Fifty years ago, I came to know that Christ is the One who sets us free from sin. However, I did not enjoy freedom from sin. I had Christ, but I did not have much enjoyment of Him because I did not realize the elements, the ingredients, of Christ. I did not realize that the extract of this Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Just as anyone who is not a doctor or a pharmacist may not know the ingredients, elements, and extract of a certain medicine, so we may not know the ingredients, elements, and extract of Christ. As a result, we may have Christ in doctrine, in terminology, but we may not have Christ in actuality and practicality. I do not ask if you know a doctrinal Christ, but if you know the practical and actual Christ. Who is the actual Christ? Who is the practical Christ? The life-giving Spirit is the actual and practical Christ.<p>Today many Christians know only a doctrinal Christ. Some of those who hold to traditional teachings concerning the Trinity even oppose the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. It is foolish to oppose this biblical truth. If we do not have the life-giving Spirit, we cannot have Christ in our experience. As the extract of an herb is actually the herb itself, so the life-giving Spirit as the extract of Christ is Christ Himself for our enjoyment.<p>The extract of an herb may be used as medicine for those who are ill. The extract is not needed in order for the herb itself to exist. In order for the herb to exist it is sufficient that it be an herb. In a similar way, in order for Christ to exist, there was no need for Him to become the life-giving Spirit. But in order for us to enjoy Him and participate in Him, it was necessary for Him to become the extract, to become the life-giving Spirit. Today we experience Christ as this life-giving Spirit. For this reason, we say that the life-giving Spirit is the actual, practical Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</h2><p>Through my years in the Lord&#8217;s ministry, I have learned that if we speak of &#8220;Christ in the flesh,&#8221; people understand that Christ Himself became flesh. However, if we speak of &#8220;Christ in the Spirit,&#8221; most do not have a proper understanding. They regard Christ as separate from the Spirit. They think of Christ as the second Person of the Godhead and the Spirit as the third Person. Furthermore, they may think that the Second is in the Third. When they hear of Christ in the flesh, they do not regard Christ as separate from the flesh. Rather, they realize that Christ in the flesh is actually Christ Himself. But if we were to speak of Christ in the Spirit, due to traditional teaching, they would regard Christ as separate from the Spirit instead of realizing that Christ Himself is the Spirit. This is the difficulty in speaking of Christ in the Spirit.<p>Some writers use the expression &#8220;pneumatic Christ.&#8221; Derived from the Greek word pneuma, &#8220;pneumatic&#8221; means spiritual. However, the pneumatic Christ is not a spiritual Christ; the pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. The Christ who gives life is the pneumatic Christ. He is not Christ in the Spirit; He is the Christ as pneuma, as the Spirit. The actual Christ, therefore, is the pneumatic Christ.<p>We have seen that many Christians have only a doctrinal Christ or a historical Christ. They do not have the actual and practical Christ. It is crucial for us to see that it is the pneumatic Christ who is real and practical to us in our daily life. It is the pneumatic Christ, the actual and practical Christ, who is the reality that sets us free. Do you have this reality? We all should strongly reply that we definitely have this reality, which is the actual, practical, present, pneumatic Christ. In brief, this reality is the life-giving Spirit.<p>Who can set us free from the bondage of sin? Only the reality which is the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, can set us free. This is the One who is the eternal God becoming a man, passing through crucifixion, entering into resurrection, being lifted up to the heavens, and becoming the life-giving Spirit. This One is the reality that sets us free.<h2 class=head1>THE GREAT I AM</h2><p>This reality includes the great I Am. The words &#8220;I Am&#8221; are the significance of the name Jehovah. Jehovah means &#8220;I Am that I Am,&#8221; In John 8:24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.&#8221; Then in verse 28 He went on to say, &#8220;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am.&#8221; Here the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;After you have lifted me up as the Son of Man, you will realize that I am. You think that I am merely a man. After you have put me to death on the cross, I will come out of the tomb. At that time you will know that the One you have crucified is not merely a man, but is the eternal God, Jehovah.&#8221;<p>The name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; means Jehovah our Savior. Hence, the name Jehovah is included in the name Jesus.<p>Now do you see what is the reality that sets us free? This reality is the eternal God who became a man, who passed through crucifixion and resurrection, who is now in ascension, and who comes to us as the life-giving Spirit. Within this reality there are the elements of the great I Am and the elements of the Son of Man, incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.<p>The fact that the Lord Jesus is the great I Am implies that He is the eternal One. In 8:57 the Jews said to the Lord, &#8220;You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?&#8221; The Lord Jesus, who was not more than thirty-three years of age, replied, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I am&#8221; (v. 58). Apparently the Lord&#8217;s word is wrong grammatically. Instead of saying, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I was,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I am.&#8221; The Lord Jesus spoke the fact, the fact that He is the eternal I Am. As the One who is the I Am, to Him there is no past tense; every time is present. But although the Lord is the eternal One, He became a limited One in time. He is the Son of God who became the Son of Man.<h2 class=head1>A PRACTICAL WAY TO BE SET FREE FROM SIN</h2><p>How in a practical way can we be set free from sin? For example, how can we be delivered from our temper? If you want to be free from your temper, do not go to the Lord and make up your mind that from now on you will never lose your temper. That is vain. You need to realize that you have the extract of Christ, the life-giving Spirit, within you, and that this Spirit is the universal reality. The life-giving Spirit is the extract of the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the great I Am, the Son of God, and the Son of Man. He is the One who died on the cross, who resurrected from the dead, and who is now in ascension. This One is in us, and the reality, the extract, of the all-inclusive Christ is the life-giving Spirit. He is living, capable, and powerful. He is in you, and He sets you free. Therefore, instead of making up your mind not to lose your temper, simply say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I worship You, I honor You, and I respect You. Lord, I love You and enjoy You. As the life-giving Spirit, You are in me to do everything for me.&#8221;<p>The life-giving Spirit, the extract of Christ, is our spiritual medicine. We should simply take this &#8220;medicine&#8221; and then rest and be at peace. The medicine will solve the problems within us. Praise the Lord for our &#8220;medicine&#8221;! Our medicine is the life-giving Spirit, the extract of the all-inclusive Christ, who is the universal reality within us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 8</h1><p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that today in actuality and practicality for our experience Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the extract of the last Adam, God incarnate. Let us now go on to consider the essence of this divine extract.<h2 class=head1>THE SON OF THE FATHER</h2><p>The greatest argument between the Lord Jesus and the Pharisees in chapter eight of the Gospel of John concerned who the Lord was. The Jews said to Him, &#8220;Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Whom are you making yourself?&#8221; (v. 53). It was difficult for the Lord Jesus to answer this question, because who He is and what He is, are not simple matters and cannot be expressed in simple terms. According to John 8, the Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father. The first element of the divine extract is the Son of the Father. The One who is the Son of the Father is the Emancipator, the One who sets us free.<p>In this chapter it is revealed very clearly that the wonderful Emancipator is the Son of the Father. The Father is the unique source. He is the source of the divine economy and of all that the Triune God is. The Emancipator, the One who sets us free from the slavery of sin, is the Son of this source. He is the expression, the coming forth, of the Father.<h2 class=head1>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2><p>In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&#8221; This indicates that the whole world is in darkness and is filled with darkness. Darkness implies sin and death. What is the darkness that fills the entire world? This darkness is sin, which issues in death. All of human society, the entire human race, is under darkness. Sin is darkness, and sin results in death. Consider the situation in the world today. In every country, including remote backward countries, the people are living in sin. They do not have any light, but instead live in darkness.<p>John chapter eight deals with fornication as the basic sin. In principle, fornication is the base for all sin. The first sin committed by Adam and Eve was, according to its spiritual significance, the sin of fornication. This means they committed fornication in turning to something other than God. Although they were made by God and for God, they left God. They turned their heart and their being to something in place of God. In principle, that was the committing of fornication. Hence, the first sin committed by Adam, according to its spiritual significance, was the sin of fornication. For this reason, we say that fornication is the basic sin, the base for all other sins.<p>In chapter eight John uses a case of fornication as an illustration of what sin is. This case is a sign that, in principle, every sin we commit is a sin of fornication. To commit spiritual fornication is to turn away from God to something apart from Him. Today the entire human race is turning away from God to other things. This means that, no matter what they are doing, in principle they are committing fornication. Whenever we enjoy other things, such as worldly entertainments and amusements, in place of God, in His sight that is fornication. John 8 deals with fornication as the basic sin.<p>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord Jesus declares that He is the light of the world. This light shines in the darkness, repels it, and even swallows it. Only light can swallow darkness. When light comes, darkness vanishes immediately. Only light can repel darkness. There is no way to get rid of darkness unless light comes. Who is the light that repels the darkness of sin and death? This light is Jesus, the Son of God.<p>When we receive the Lord Jesus, He becomes the light of life to us. This means that the light becomes life and brings in life. According to Genesis 1, when there was light, it was possible for living things to come into existence.<p>Light issues in life. As the Son of God, Christ is the light of the world. When we receive the shining of this light, we receive life, for the light, as the light of life, issues in life. This light is different from natural light or electrical light, which are not living. The light we have received from Christ is living. It lives in us, it grows, and it reproduces because it is the light of life.<p>Now we have seen three elements of the divine extract: the Son of the Father, light, and life. Let us now go on to consider the great I Am.<h2 class=head1>THE &#8220;I AM&#8221;</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the I Am. His name is I Am, the eternal One. In 8:58 the Lord said, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I Am.&#8221; The Lord as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God. Hence, He is before Abraham and greater than Abraham.<p>The words &#8220;I Am&#8221; are related to the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; To be is to exist. In His creation, God called things into being. Actually, God did not make anything, but rather called everything into being. In Romans 4:17 Paul speaks of God as the One who &#8220;calls the things not being as being.&#8221; For something to be called into being is for that thing to exist. At one time there was no light. This means that light did not exist. Then God said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and light came to be; that is, it came into existence.<p>Do you know who God is? God is the unique I Am. He is the unique One who has being, the great &#8220;To Be.&#8221; We, on the contrary, are not. In ourselves, we do not have any being. This means that the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can be applied only to God and not to us. We need to realize that we are nothing, that in ourselves we do not have any being. Do you know what it means to be nothing? It means that you are not, that the words &#8220;I am&#8221; and &#8220;to be&#8221; cannot be applied to you. Only God is the I Am. Only He has being. He is the To Be. God is the universal To Be, the genuine being. Apart from Him, nothing else has any being. Rather, everything is vanity; everything is nothing.<p>When the Pharisees asked the Lord who He was, He replied by saying, &#8220;I Am.&#8221; Here the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;I Am that I Am. I am the unique being; I am the To Be. But you scribes and Pharisees are nothing. You are nobody. I am the eternal One, the only One who is, the only One who is real.&#8221;<p>Only the I Am is reality. Because He is the To Be, He is reality. Anything that does not have being cannot have any reality. Whatever does not have being is empty, vain. Because only God is the I Am, Solomon could say that all things are &#8220;vanity of vanities.&#8221; Only One is the I Am.<p>We have seen that in 8:58 the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as I Am. This expression is used two other times in this chapter. In verse 24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.&#8221; I Am is the meaning of the name Jehovah (Exo. 3:14), and Jehovah is the name of God in relation to man (Gen. 2:7). Hence, it denotes the Lord as the ever-existing God in relation to man. If any man does not believe that the Lord is this very God, that man will die in his sins. In verse 28 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am....&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY</h2><p>In 8:32 the Lord says, &#8220;And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free.&#8221; Reality is not the so-called truth of doctrine, but the reality of the truth which is the Lord Himself (14:6; 1:14, 17). Verse 32 says that the reality will set us free. But verse 36 says, &#8220;If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free.&#8221; This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the reality. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the element of God realized by us. When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, and this light brings the divine element as reality into us.<p>The Lord is the reality because He is the I Am, because He is the To Be. Therefore, reality is the I Am, the To Be. The reality that sets us free is this I Am. The great To Be sets us free. This One is Jehovah, the One who was, who is, and who will be. Jesus is this very Jehovah. The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. Therefore, Jesus is the great I Am, the great To Be. Because He is the To Be, He is the reality.<p>The Lord told the scribes and the Pharisees, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I am&#8221; (v. 58). The past tense is used for Abraham, but the present tense is used for the Lord Jesus. Grammatically speaking, the Lord&#8217;s word seems to be wrong. We would not say, &#8220;Before you came, I am.&#8221; Instead, we would say, &#8220;Before you came, I was here.&#8221; However, it is altogether correct for the Lord to say, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I am.&#8221; The Lord is the ever-existing One. Before Abraham came into being, He was already the I Am. This great I Am, the eternal To Be, is the reality.<h2 class=head1>TO RELEASE MAN FROM THE BONDAGE OF SIN</h2><p>As the Emancipator, the Lord releases us from the bondage of sin and makes us sons of God free from death (8:32-36, 51). The Lord is the One who frees us from sin. In verse 51 He says, &#8220;If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.&#8221; This indicates that when we become sons of God, we shall never die. The Son of God is everlasting. The Son of God is eternal because the life of the Son of God is eternal life, which never dies. Hence, He can release us from the bondage of sin and, by imparting eternal life to us, make us sons of God free from death.<h2 class=head1>LIFTED UP ON THE CROSS AS THE SON OF MAN</h2><p>In verse 28 the Lord Jesus referred to His being lifted up on the cross. According to this verse, the Lord was lifted up on the cross as the Son of Man. The Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father. As such, He is the great I Am, the eternal To Be. But when He was lifted up on the cross, He was the Son of Man. This Son of Man is also one of the elements in the divine extract.<p>Thus far we have seen a number of elements contained in the divine extract. The first element is the Son of the Father. The second element is the light of the world, which becomes the light of life within us. The third element is the universal I Am. Now we see a fourth element-the Son of Man. Because the life-giving Spirit is an extract containing all these elements, this extract is truly powerful and effective.<p>In chapter eight of the Gospel of John there is no mention of the Spirit. But there is a clear word concerning the Spirit in 7:37-39. On the last day of the feast the Lord cried out and said, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (vv. 37-38). Then verse 39 follows to say, &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; In chapter eight we can see Christ glorified, for here we have the lifting up of Christ as the Son of Man. This lifting up was followed by resurrection, and in resurrection the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ came into being. In chapter seven the Spirit was &#8220;not yet.&#8221; But in chapter eight, after the lifting up of the Son of Man, the Spirit came into being. This Spirit is the extract of the Son of the Father, the light of life, the eternal I Am, and the Son of Man. In this extract we have all these elements.<h2 class=head1>HONORING THE FATHER AND NOT SEEKING HIS OWN GLORY</h2><p>The One who is the great I Am and also the Son of Man honored the Father and never sought His own glory 8:49-50, 54). Here we do not have an element of the divine extract, but we do have the nature of the element of the Lord&#8217;s living as the Son of Man. The nature of this element is the Lord&#8217;s honoring the Father and not seeking His own glory. The Lord always honored the Father, and He never sought glory for Himself.<p>If we do not honor the Father but instead seek our own glory, in principle we commit spiritual fornication. We need to be set free from this. This means that to be set free from sin in John 8 includes to be set free from honoring ourselves and from seeking glory for ourselves. If we seek glory for ourselves, in principle we are committing fornication.<p>Here we have a deeper understanding of sin. Even if we seek a little glory for ourselves, we are committing sin, in principle committing fornication. For example, when you give a testimony in the meetings, you may desire to hear many &#8220;Amens.&#8221; If this is your desire, you are seeking glory for yourself, and you are not honoring the Father. This is sin. What can deal with this sin? Only the divine extract can deal with it. The nature of this extract is that it does not seek self-glory but always honors the Father.<h2 class=head1>EXPECTED WITH EXULTATION BY ABRAHAM</h2><p>In 8:56 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Your father Abraham exulted that he should see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.&#8221; Although Abraham expected the Lord with exultation, we are no longer expecting Him-we are enjoying Him.<h2 class=head1>SLANDERED BY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE</h2><p>The Lord Jesus as the Son of the Father was slandered by religious people, who regarded Him as a Samaritan possessed by a demon (8:48, 52). According to verse 48, they said, &#8220;Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?&#8221; Here we see that they slandered the Lord by accusing Him of being impure. A Samaritan is a person of mixed blood, a person who is part Jewish and part pagan. The religious people not only accused the Lord of being a Samaritan, but accused Him of being a Samaritan possessed by a demon. What slander this is! In principle, religious people are doing the same thing today by opposing those who take the Lord&#8217;s way.<h2 class=head1>TEMPTED AND PERSECUTED BY THOSE SEEKING TO KILL HIM</h2><p>The Lord Jesus also was tempted and persecuted by those who sought to kill Him (vv. 6, 20, 37, 40, 59). The Lord was slandered, tempted, and persecuted, and certain ones were looking for the opportunity to kill Him. Those in the religious world slandered this Emancipator or persecuted or sought to tempt Him. The church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is in a similar situation of being slandered and persecuted. But while others slander, tempt, and persecute, we enjoy the wonderful One who is our Emancipator.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 9; 6:33; 7:38-39; 8:12</h1><p>The Gospel of John is outstanding among the four Gospels. The other three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke- are called the synoptic Gospels, and they record different aspects of the Lord&#8217;s humanity. He is presented as the King in Matthew, as a Slave in Mark, and as the Savior in Luke. The King, the Slave, and the Savior are all related to the humanity of Christ. In the Gospel of John, however, the emphasis is on the divinity of the Lord Jesus. In this Gospel He is revealed as the Son of God (John 1:49; 20:31).<p>Because the Gospel of John reveals Christ in His divinity, this Gospel speaks of things that are mysterious. Divine things are mysterious. The mysterious, divine things recorded in the Gospel of John are the reality of the universe.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THE HUMAN VESSELS CREATED BY GOD</h2><p>In a previous message we pointed out that the universe may be regarded as a huge shell. What is the content of this shell, the content of the universe? Throughout the centuries, philosophers, scientists, and teachers have not been able to say what the reality of the universe is. As we have pointed out, if we get into the depths of the truth revealed in the Bible, we shall see that the reality of the universe is the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Just as the universe has a content, so we human beings also have a content, a reality. If the universe did not have a reality, then the entire universe would be only an empty shell. For there to be no reality in the universe would mean that the universe would not have any content. Likewise, if we had only a physical body but did not have an inner being, we also would be an empty shell. Our inner being is our reality.<p>The Bible reveals that we are vessels. In Romans 9:21 and 23 Paul says, &#8220;Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?...And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory...?&#8221;<p>As vessels created by God, we can be compared to bottles designed to contain a particular beverage. But suppose a certain bottle is empty. An empty bottle does not have any content, and without content, the bottle does not have any meaning. In order for a bottle to have meaning and fulfill its purpose, it needs to be filled with the beverage it was designed to contain.<p>The principle is the same with us as vessels. We were designed by God to contain a heavenly beverage. Jesus refers to this beverage in John 7:37 when, on the last day of the feast of tabernacles, He stood up and cried, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (John 7:37-38). Here we see that the human vessel may not only be filled with living water, filled with the heavenly beverage, but may also overflow with this living water. First we are filled with living water, and then living water flows out from our inner being.<p>In his Gospel the Apostle John emphasizes truth, reality. We see this in the opening chapter of the Gospel of John: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality....grace and reality came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (vv. 14, 17). In these verses reality, or truth, does not refer to doctrine. John is not saying in 1:14 that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of doctrine. In this verse reality, truth, refers to the divine reality.<p>When I was writing the notes on the Epistles of John, I was very exercised over the word truth in John&#8217;s writings. Truth is a crucial word in both the Gospel of John and in his Epistles. As a result of much study, we have come to see that in the writings of John truth refers not to doctrine but to reality.<p>In order to have content, the universe must have a reality. In a similar way, as human beings, vessels created by God, we also need content, reality. This reality is the divine Person, the Triune God. The Triune God is the reality of the universe. Apart from the Triune God, the universe is an empty shell. In the same principle, apart from the Triune God, we also are empty shells. If the universe were merely a shell, there would be nothing but emptiness and vanity. Realizing this, King Solomon said, &#8220;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&#8221; (Eccl. 1:2). Solomon also said that everything under the sun is vanity. It is true that if the Triune God were not the content of the universe and of our being, everything would be empty, vanity.<p>The tabernacle in the Old Testament contained the ark, the incense altar, the lampstand, and the table. In the court of the tabernacle there were the altar of burnt offering and the laver. In addition, there were all the different utensils. Apart from Christ, the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils would have been empty. The same is true of us. God is our reality. Without Him, we are merely empty vessels, empty beings.<p>God is not simple and, as vessels made to contain Him, we are not simple either. According to the entire revelation of the Scriptures, God is triune. Furthermore, we are tripartite; that is, we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. As tripartite beings, we need the Triune God to be our content, our reality.<h2 class=head1>PICTURES OF INVISIBLE THINGS</h2><p>The Triune God is the reality of the universe and also the reality of the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils. Many teachers of the Bible have pointed out that the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils is a shadow or picture of invisible things. As such a picture, the tabernacle points to the divine mysteries.<p>In the books of Exodus and Leviticus there are many types of Christ. Dr. Scofield once said that we can see Christ on every page of the book of Leviticus. The tabernacle and its furniture, the offerings, and all the priestly garments are pictures of Christ. For example, every aspect of the clothing worn by the high priest-the ephod, the inner robe, and the turban-is a type of Christ. Because Christ is divine and mysterious, God in His wisdom used the types in the Old Testament as pictures of Christ.<p>All these messages are concerned with the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John. Throughout years of study and experience, I have come to realize that the tabernacle and the offerings, which are pictures of Christ in the Old Testament, are fulfilled in the New Testament. This fulfillment is clearly recorded in the writings of John. We can see more of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John than in the other New Testament books.<p>John&#8217;s writings are of three categories: his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation. In these writings we see signs that point to the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. For this reason, in these messages we are giving special attention to the signs in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>We have seen that in chapter one of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the signs of the tabernacle and the Lamb of God. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. In the book of Revelation the Apostle John also speaks concerning the tabernacle. For example, Revelation 7:15 says, &#8220;Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.&#8221; A literal translation of the Greek words rendered &#8220;shall spread His tabernacle over them&#8221; would be &#8220;shall tabernacle over them.&#8221; Christ is the tabernacle of God, and the New Jerusalem as the ultimate enlargement of Christ will be God&#8217;s eternal tabernacle, where all God&#8217;s redeemed ones will dwell with Him forever. God will overshadow them with Himself as embodied in Christ. As the embodiment of God, Christ will be their tabernacle.<p>In Revelation 21:2 and 3 we see that the New Jerusalem will be the eternal tabernacle: &#8220;And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.&#8221; Here we see that, as God&#8217;s habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity. The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle (Exo. 25:8-9; Lev. 26:11). First, that type was fulfilled in Christ as God&#8217;s tabernacle among men, and it will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem. From these verses we see the fulfillment of the tabernacle in the writings of John.<h2 class=head1>THE FULFILLMENT OF THE OFFERINGS</h2><p>In John&#8217;s writings we also have the fulfillment of the offerings. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; In the Gospel of John, the Lamb of God is the aggregate, the totality, of all the offerings. Hence, in John&#8217;s Gospel we have the Lamb as the fulfillment of the Old Testament offerings.<p>The book of Revelation also has much to say concerning Christ as the Lamb. Everyone who reads Revelation should pay attention to this extraordinary expression. In Revelation 5:6 we see &#8220;a Lamb standing as having been slain&#8221;; in 6:1, &#8220;the Lamb opened one of the seven seals&#8221;; in 7:17 we are told that &#8220;the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and shall guide them to springs of waters of life&#8221;; in 12:11 it is said that &#8220;they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb&#8221;; in 13:8 we read of &#8220;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world&#8221;; in 14:1 we have &#8220;the Lamb standing on mount Zion&#8221;; and in 22:1 we are shown the river of water of life &#8220;proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Again and again, the book of Revelation speaks concerning the Lamb. For eternity, the Lamb will be sitting on the throne of God in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the writings of John we see the Lamb as the fulfillment of all the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>Other aspects of the Old Testament tabernacle are also fulfilled in John&#8217;s writings. Consider the lampstand. The first mention of the lampstand is in the book of Exodus, where we are told that the lampstand was in the tabernacle (Exo. 25:31). In chapters eight and nine of the Gospel of John we are told that Christ is the light of the world. In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&#8221; In 9:5 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#8221; In these chapters we have Christ as the reality of the lampstand. As the lampstand, the Lord Jesus is the light of life to enlighten this dark world. Furthermore, in chapter one of Revelation we have &#8220;seven golden lampstands&#8221; (vv. 12, 20). This is another indication that in the writings of John we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD REVEALED IN THE WORD</h2><p>Let us now say a further word concerning reality. In John 1:1-3 we see that in the beginning was the Word and that all things came into being through Him. Through the Word, who is the very God, the entire universe was created. In verse 4 John goes on to say, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8221; According to verse 14, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. In the footnote on truth in 1 John 1:6 in the Recovery Version and in messages nine through eleven of the Life-study of 1 John, we point out that in John&#8217;s writings truth, or reality, first refers to the Triune God. This means that God is the reality, that Christ is the reality, and that the Spirit is the reality. Furthermore, the word God speaks is reality.<p>How can we say that God Himself is reality? We can say this because John 1 reveals that God became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of reality. John 1:17 also says that grace and reality came through the incarnated God. As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the way, and the reality, and the life&#8221; (John 14:6). Before He died, the Lord spoke concerning the Spirit of reality (14:17; 15:26; 16:13). In his first Epistle John clearly says that the Spirit is the truth, the reality (1 John 5:6). Moreover, in John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&#8221; Therefore, from all these verses we see that reality is God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word.<p>God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word convey the reality of the universe. The Triune God is Himself this reality, and the Triune God is revealed in the Word and conveyed by the Word. This means that the Word is also the reality, the reality which is actually the Triune God Himself. In His incarnation, the Triune God was the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. Therefore, as the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ is the real tabernacle, and He is the real offerings.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 9:1-41; 6:33; 7:38-39; 8:12</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the signs in chapter nine of the Gospel of John. This chapter contains an interesting story, a story of the Lord&#8217;s giving sight to a man who was blind from birth. According to verses 6 and 7, the Lord Jesus &#8220;spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay, and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which translated means sent). So he went and washed and came seeing.&#8221;<p>When I was young, I thought that this story was rather amusing. I thought that it was very unusual for the Lord to spit on the ground, make clay of the spittle, and then anoint the blind man&#8217;s eyes with the clay. Then He told the blind man to walk a distance to the pool of Siloam, and there to wash away the clay from his eyes. I could not understand the significance of this story.<p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs. In chapter one we have the sign of the Lamb with a dove upon Him (1:29, 32); in chapter two, the sign of the changing of water into wine (2:1-11); in chapter three, the sign of a brass serpent lifted up on a pole (3:14); in chapter four, the sign of Jacob&#8217;s well at the foot of a mountain (4:6, 20); in chapter five, the sign of the pool of Bethesda around which lay many who were sick, blind, lame, and withered (5:1-3). All these signs are pictures with a particular spiritual significance. The case of the Lord&#8217;s giving sight to the blind man in chapter nine is also a sign with spiritual significance.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF A BLIND MAN TO MANIFEST THE WORKS OF GOD</h2><p>John 9:1 says, &#8220;And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.&#8221; This signifies that as fallen people, descendants of Adam, we all were born blind.<p>I would ask you to consider your situation before you were saved. Before you were saved, you did not know where you came from or where you were going. You did not know the significance of the universe, and you did not know yourself. You did not know these things, because you were born blind. I can testify that I was born blind. As one who was blind from birth, I did not know spiritual things before I was saved. Is it not true that you also were born blind?<p>According to 9:2, the Lord&#8217;s disciples said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?&#8221; The disciples&#8217; question indicates that they still held certain religious concepts. According to their concept, they regarded this man&#8217;s blindness as being the result of some sin committed either by him or by his parents.<p>The Lord answered His disciples by saying, &#8220;Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him&#8221; (v. 3). Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &#8220;Do not ask whose fault it is that this man is blind. You ask whose sin caused him to be blind. But I say that neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but this blindness is that the works of God might be manifested in him. You need to drop your religious concept.&#8221;<p>We all were born blind, but our blindness gives the Lord an opportunity to manifest the works of God in us. How wonderful that God has the opportunity to manifest His marvelous works in us! Our blindness gives Him a good opportunity to manifest His works. Therefore, we may say to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, without me, You would not have this opportunity to manifest Your works. If I had not been born blind, You would not have the way to manifest Your wonderful works in me. Lord, my blindness gives You an opportunity to express Yourself in Your works.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD TO HEAL THE BLINDNESS OF MAN</h2><p>In verses 4 and 5 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#8221; After reading these verses, we may wonder how to connect light and blindness. Apparently, light and blindness are not related.<p>Blindness denotes darkness. According to the Gospel of John, blindness issues in darkness. If you were blind, you would be in darkness, not able to see anything. According to the first Epistle of John, darkness also causes blindness: &#8220;But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes&#8221; (1 John 2:11). On the one hand, blindness causes darkness; on the other hand, darkness causes blindness. According to the Gospel of John, blindness comes first and then darkness. But according to the first Epistle of John, we first have darkness and then are blinded by this darkness. But since we are concerned in this message with chapter nine of the Gospel of John, we need to realize that here blindness is equal to darkness. Hence, the blind man in this chapter needs the light of the world.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNS OF THE CLAY, THE LORD&#8217;S SPITTLE, AND THE ANOINTING</h2><p>At this point we need to raise an important question: How can the light come into one who is born blind? We were born blind, and Christ is the light of the world (8:12). But how can this light enter into us? According to this chapter, in order for the light to come into us, we need the anointing. If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the Lord&#8217;s spittle, and the anointing itself.<p>We may not regard the words &#8220;clay&#8221; and &#8220;spittle&#8221; as positive. Of course, the word &#8220;anointed&#8221; in verse 6 is certainly a positive term. The word &#8220;anointing&#8221; is a scriptural word. In his first Epistle John says, &#8220;You have an anointing from the Holy One,&#8221; and &#8220;His anointing teaches you concerning all things&#8221; (1 John 2:20, 27). John, no doubt, takes this word from chapter thirty of Exodus, which speaks of a holy anointing oil (v. 25). This is a further indication that the writings of John are the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. Our point here is that it is by the anointing that the light of the world is able to come into a man born blind.<p>The anointing in John 9 is a compound formed of earth mixed with spittle. We may say that the earth is compounded with the Lord&#8217;s spittle and mingled with it. In other words, the spittle saturates the earth and permeates it. The earth was dry at first, but after the spittle was mingled with it, the earth became wet and was made into clay. This clay, therefore, is a compound, and this compound was used as an ointment by the Lord Jesus to anoint the eyes of the blind man.<p>What the Lord Jesus did in 9:6 can be compared to the creation of man from the dust of the ground. Genesis 2:7 says, &#8220;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#8221; Here we see that man&#8217;s body was formed of the dust of the ground, that the Lord breathed the breath of life into him, and that man then became a living soul. The principle is nearly the same in chapter nine of John. In Genesis 2:7 we have dust; in John 9:6 we have the earth. In Genesis 2 the Lord breathed into man the breath of life; in John 9, the Lord spat on the ground and then made clay of the spittle.<p>Clay signifies the natural man, the man created by God. As those created by God, we all are clay. This is indicated not only by Genesis 2:7 but also by the word of the Apostle Paul: &#8220;Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?&#8221; (Rom. 9:21). We are vessels made of clay to contain God Himself.<p>The spittle, as something that proceeds out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth (Matt. 4:4), signifies His words, which are spirit and life (John 6:63). The words the Lord speaks issue from His mouth, and His words are spirit and life. Therefore, spittle signifies the words that issue out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth.<p>To make clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord&#8217;s living word, which is the Spirit. The word &#8220;anointed&#8221; here proves this, because the Lord&#8217;s Spirit is the anointing Spirit (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27). Hence, this compound, this anointing, is formed by mingling the Spirit with the man created by God.<p>In this chapter we have the mingling of spittle with earth to make clay. Another kind of mingling is found in Leviticus 2, where we have the mingling of oil with fine flour to make the meal offering. Both the clay in John 9 and the meal offering in Leviticus 2 are a compound. The meal offering is a compound formed by mingling two elements-oil and flour. The clay is also a compound formed by mingling two elements-spittle and earth. As we have indicated, the clay signifies us, human beings created by God, and the spittle signifies the Lord&#8217;s word, which is spirit and life. Therefore, the clay here signifies the mingling of the Spirit with our being.<p>Now we can see how the light of the world, Jesus Christ, can come into a person who was born blind. The light of the world comes into a blind man through the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with our being. In order to come into us, Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit He is able to come into us and mingle with us. This is the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing in this chapter.<p>The blind man in John 9 was cast out of the synagogue (vv. 34, 22). Verse 35 says, &#8220;Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, He said, Do you believe in the Son of God?&#8221; Notice that the Lord Jesus did not ask him if he believed the Son of God; He asked him if he believed in the Son of God. The Greek preposition translated &#8220;in&#8221; here actually means &#8220;into.&#8221; Believing into the Son of God implies an organic union between the believer and the Son of God in whom he believes. When we believe in the Son of God, we believe into Him. This means that our believing brings about an organic union between us and the Son of God, and in this union we are one with Him. It is in this way that the light of the world comes into a blind person. It is in this way that a person born blind becomes one with Him who is the light of the world. The result is that blindness vanishes.<p>The Gospel of John is a profound book. Because this Gospel is profound, we should not understand it in a shallow way. Rather, we need to touch the depths of the revelation in this book. For example, in chapter two we have the sign of changing water into wine. It is important to know the significance of this sign. Water here signifies death, and the six waterpots full of water (six is the number of man) signify man full of death. Wine signifies a pleasant life. Hence, the changing of water into wine signifies the changing of death into a pleasant life. To have this understanding is to touch the depths of the truth related to this sign.<p>In the same principle, we need to understand the signs in chapter nine of the Gospel of John in a deep way. In this chapter the spittle signifies the words, which are spirit and life, issuing out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth, and the clay signifies humanity. Making clay with spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the word spoken by the Lord, a word spoken from within the Lord Himself, and which is spirit and life. When we receive the Lord Jesus as the Spirit and life and believe in Him, we enter into an organic union with Him. In this union He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him. This is the way Christ as the light of the world comes into a blind person. When this light comes into a person born blind, his blindness vanishes, and he receives his sight.<p>Many of us can testify that when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we received our sight and began to see a marvelous, divine view. Before we received the Lord, we were altogether ignorant of spiritual things. But after we believed in the Lord Jesus and entered into an organic union with Him, spiritual things began to be clear to us. We also had a clear view of human life, of where we came from and where we are going, and of the meaning of human life. The reason we could see these things is that the light of the world had been mingled with our being. As a result of the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with our being, our blindness disappeared.<p>Consider the case of Saul of Tarsus. Before he was called by the Lord Jesus, he did not know he was blind. Saul had been educated in Tarsus, a city known for its culture. Not only did he have a good secular education, but he had been trained in the things of Judaism. But although Saul was a highly educated person, he was blind. However, he did not know that he was blind. He knew so many things, but he did not know the Lord Jesus. Then one day the Lord appeared to him and called to him, saying, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#8221; (Acts 9:4). Saul answered, &#8220;Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest&#8221; (v. 5). Saul may have wondered how he could have been persecuting Jesus. According to his understanding, he persecuted Stephen and other disciples of the Lord Jesus. But as far as he was concerned, Jesus was in the tomb. How blind he was!<p>After Saul met the Lord Jesus, he became physically blind for a period of time. &#8220;And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight&#8221; (Acts 9:8-9a). Saul had led others to persecute Jesus; now it was necessary for others to lead him.<p>When the Lord Jesus called Saul on the way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, &#8220;I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God&#8221; (Acts 26:16-18a). Perhaps Saul wondered why, if the Lord was sending him to open the eyes of others, his own eyes had been closed. If Saul had asked the Lord concerning this, the Lord may have told him that his eyes had been too open, and now they needed to be closed so that he could see spiritual things.<p>During the days he was physically blind, Saul may have seen many divine and spiritual things, not, of course, with his physical eyes, but with his inner, spiritual eyes. Formerly, his physical eyes were open, but his inner eyes were blind. But after he met the Lord Jesus, his inner eyes were opened, and, for a period of time, his physical eyes were blinded. Because Saul&#8217;s spiritual eyes were now open and he could see spiritual things, the Lord told him that he was sending him to open the eyes of the Gentiles, all of whom were born blind.<p>All of today&#8217;s unbelievers are blind. Is there anyone who is not blind from birth? No, without exception, we all were born blind. We may have the highest education and the most developed culture; nevertheless, we have been born blind. This is still the situation of all unbelievers. Therefore, the unbelievers need the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with their being. If they experience this mingling, the divine light will come into them, their blindness will vanish, and their darkness will disappear.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF WASHING IN THE POOL OF SILOAM</h2><p>According to the Bible, the Lord has done everything for our salvation. However, His work requires our cooperation. At least, it requires our belief. If we do not believe, then whatever the Lord has done cannot be applied to us. We need to cooperate with the Lord&#8217;s work by believing and being baptized. To believe is an inward obedience to the Lord&#8217;s salvation, and to be baptized is an outward obedience to the Lord&#8217;s word. The sign of washing in the pool of Siloam signifies the washing of baptism in obedience to the Lord (9:7, 11).<p>When I was young, I realized that it was very important to believe in the Lord, but I did not have much appreciation for baptism. I could not see the meaning of putting someone into water, and I did not regard this as necessary. Certain Christian groups do not believe in water baptism, for they consider baptism purely a spiritual matter. Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the subjective death of Christ, and she insisted that baptism in water was not necessary.<p>We may say that being baptized can be compared to washing in the pool of Siloam. The Lord Jesus clearly commanded the blind man to go and wash in that pool. Suppose the blind man had argued with the Lord and said, &#8220;Lord, You have put clay on my eyes. Why do You now tell me to wash in the pool of Siloam? Why must I do this in order to receive my sight?&#8221; If the blind man had argued with the Lord in this way, he would not have received his sight, because he would not have cooperated with the Lord by obeying His word. However, he did obey the Lord&#8217;s word, and &#8220;he went and washed and came seeing&#8221; (v. 7b).<p>Clay signifies the man created by God. Our created man has become the old man, and the old man has been crucified with Christ. In baptism we wash away this old man.<p>As those who have believed in the Lord Jesus and who have entered into an organic union with Him, daily we need to practice the washing away of our old man. On the one hand, we can declare that because we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have a divine view and can see spiritual things. But on the other hand, we must admit that we have not always been obedient to practice the washing away of our old man. As a result, we may still have clay on our eyes. This is the reason many Christians do not have a clear view of spiritual things and do not have proper light.<p>Sometimes we have been asked how we are able to receive so much light from the Word of God. Certain ones have said, &#8220;We read the same Bible you do, but you have light and we don&#8217;t. What is the reason for this?&#8221; The reason is that the clay has been washed away from our eyes. As long as the clay of the natural man remains on a believer&#8217;s eyes, he will be blind to spiritual things. All the clay needs to be washed away. Therefore, we should not hold on to the old man with his old culture, ethical concepts, and religion.<p>Even though you have believed in the Lord Jesus and have entered into an organic union with Him, you may still have the clay of the old man on your eyes. Therefore, you need to obey the Lord, go to the pool of Siloam, and wash away your old man. We all need to wash away the old man day by day.<p>I can testify that as I was preparing to give this message, I prayed, &#8220;Lord Jesus, deliver me from the old man, and infuse me with Your feeling, thought, word, and expression.&#8221; On the negative side, I realize that I need the washing away of the old man; on the positive side, I need to be infused with the Lord. This is the way to receive divine light.<p>We should practice the daily washing away of the old man. This is our obedience in cooperation with the Lord&#8217;s revelation. He is everything to us in a practical way, not in a theoretical way. He is the light of the world, and He is the life-giving Spirit. He is ready to mingle Himself with us. We have believed into Him, and we are organically one with Him. However, we may still keep our old man. This means that we do not obey His word to go to the pool of Siloam and wash.<p>The word &#8220;Siloam&#8221; means sent, as is pointed out in 9:7. The word &#8220;sent&#8221; in this verse has the sense of an envoy being sent with a special commission. This indicates that when the Lord told the blind man to go to the pool of Siloam and wash, He was sending him on a mission. He was sending him to carry out a particular work for a specific purpose. Hence, this sending is crucial. If the blind man had not been willing to be sent, he would have been in even greater darkness.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE SABBATH DAY</h2><p>As a sign, the Sabbath day (9:14) signifies rest, including release and satisfaction. When the blind man was without sight, he did not have this rest on the Sabbath. But after the Lord worked on him, he had such a rest in receiving his sight. Yet the religious people cared for their regulations instead of this rest. The Lord&#8217;s salvation of the blind man became a stumbling to them and was condemned by them (9:16).<h2 class=head1>THE PERSECUTION OF RELIGION</h2><p>In chapter nine of the Gospel of John we can see the persecution of the Lord by religion. This matter is emphasized by John in his writings. John shows us that the Hebrew religion, not a pagan religion, persecuted the Lord Jesus. This religion with its forms, rituals, ordinances, and practices opposed Christ as the living reality. For example, Christ is the real temple, and all the forms, rituals, ordinances, and practices are pictures of Christ as the living reality. But the religious people rejected this living Person, the One who is the unique reality, and held to their religion. John, therefore, points out that these religious things oppose the living Person of Christ, who is the Triune God incarnated and who has become the life-giving Spirit. Today this One is working within us, upon us, and among us. But just as religion opposed Him in ancient times, so religion opposes those who follow the Lord today. As long as something has become a religion, it stands in opposition to the living Christ.<p>According to John 9, the religious ones slandered the Lord. They said, &#8220;This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath&#8221; (9:16). They also accused the Lord of being a sinner (v. 24). Furthermore, the religionists said to the man who had been blind, &#8220;You were wholly born in sins, and are you teaching us? And they cast him out&#8221; (v. 34). Anyone who was cast out of the synagogue lost his means of earning a living, for anyone who had been ostracized from the Jewish community had no way to get a living for himself. Such was the situation of the man who had been born blind. As we shall see, his being cast out of the synagogue was actually his coming out of the fold. Christ as the light of the world became the door for him to come out of the old, religious fold and to follow Him as the living reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39</h1><h2 class=head1>A BOOK OF SIGNS</h2><p>The record in the Gospel of John is deep and profound. In writing this Gospel John used certain cases from the Lord&#8217;s ministry, cases that are regarded as signs. In 20:30 and 31 he says, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221; These verses indicate that the Gospel of John is a book of signs. The various cases recorded in this Gospel, therefore, are signs.<p>In chapter three of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the case of Nicodemus. The more we consider this case, the more we shall be enlightened to know the natural life.<p>In chapter four we have the case of the Samaritan woman. Although this woman was immoral, she pretended to be religious and to worship God. As we consider this case, we see that only Jesus Christ is the fountain of living water that can quench the thirst in our human life. The water from Jacob&#8217;s well cannot quench our thirst. Furthermore, Christ is the reality by which and through which we can genuinely worship God. The Samaritans did not worship God in a genuine way. Only Christ can satisfy the thirst in our human life, and only He is the reality that can afford us the genuine worship of God.<p>In chapter five we have the case of an impotent man who had been sick for thirty-eight years. The background of this case was &#8220;a feast of the Jews&#8221; (5:1), which was the feast of Purim recorded in the book of Esther. According to the book of Esther, Haman&#8217;s intention was to terminate the Jews. Hence, the Jews&#8217; destiny was to be slaughtered. But God came in to change the day of termination into a day of liberation. That day was a day of the Jews&#8217; passing out of death into life. Because the Jewish people had been released, they passed out of death into life. This is the background of the Lord&#8217;s word in 5:24: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&#8221; The Lord Jesus is the real Mordecai, the One who rescues the Jews and brings them out of death into life. In chapter five of John we see how the Lord rescued the impotent man and caused him to pass out of death into life.<h2 class=head1>THE FEAST OF DEDICATION</h2><p>Chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John are actually concerned with one case-the case of a man who was blind from birth. In this case also one of the Jewish feasts was the background. The background in this case was the feast of Dedication. John 10:22 says, &#8220;At that time the feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter.&#8221;<p>The biblical record is economical, and no words are wasted. Why, then, in a chapter concerned with Christ as life is there a verse telling us about the feast of Dedication? Apparently, verse 22 has nothing to do with life. Actually, it is very meaningful that this verse is included.<p>The feast of Dedication was a commemoration of the restoration of the polluted temple. The temple had been polluted by a cruel Syrian king named Antiochus Epiphanes. The coming of this king was prophesied in chapters eight and eleven of the book Daniel. Antiochus Epiphanes was the little horn that sprang out of one of the four horns. According to the prophecy in Daniel, this king blasphemed God. He occupied the temple and polluted it by offering swine on the altar. Daniel also prophesied that the wise among God&#8217;s people would be bold to do valiant things against this evil one. One of these wise ones was Judas Maccabaeus, who took the lead to fight against Antiochus Epiphanes. In a war that lasted approximately three years, Judas Maccabaeus was victorious, and the temple was restored and cleansed. The feast of Dedication commemorates the restoration and purification of the temple.<p>A story has been told among the Jews that when Antiochus Epiphanes was about to seize the temple, the high priest concealed the flagon of oil used for lighting the lamps on the lampstand. When the temple was restored by Judas Maccabaeus, there was not an adequate supply of oil to use in lighting the lamps. Eventually they found the flagon of oil, which had been sealed by the signet of the high priest. However, that supply of oil was not sufficient to keep the lamps lighted for very long. Nevertheless, in a miraculous way that small supply of oil lasted for eight days. According to the story, the more the oil was used, the more its supply increased. In the feast of Dedication the Jewish people remembered that miracle by lighting lamps both in the temple and in their homes. Hence, the feast of Dedication, which lasted for eight days, was a feast of lights. It was during this feast that the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem and gave sight to a blind man.<p>Although the feast of Dedication was a time of light, the blind man was in darkness. In 9:5 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#8221; The lights from the lamps in the feast of Dedication were of no help to the blind man. Therefore, in 9:5 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &#8220;I am the real light. Physical light cannot help you. You need Me as the light of the world.&#8221;<p>Josephus, a Jewish historian, calls the feast of Dedication a feast of lights. As we have pointed out, during this feast the Jews lighted lamps in the temple and in their homes. With this feast as the background, the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem to indicate to the Jewish people that He is the real light.<p>For the blind man to receive his sight was for him to receive light. As a result of receiving light, he came out of darkness. But although the blind man had received his sight, the Pharisees were still blind and in darkness (9:39-41).<h2 class=head1>THE DOOR OF THE SHEEPFOLD</h2><h2 class=head2>Thieves and Robbers Coming In Another Way</h2><p>Chapter ten of the Gospel of John is the direct continuation of chapter nine. If we do not realize that chapters nine and ten are linked, we shall not understand why chapter ten opens the way it does. Chapter nine concludes with the words, &#8220;Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains&#8221; (vv. 40-41). Then in 10:1 the Lord continues, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up elsewhere, he is a thief and a robber&#8221; (v. 1). If we realize that this is a direct continuation of chapter nine, we shall understand that the Lord is saying that it is the Pharisees who are thieves and robbers, for they did not enter the sheepfold through Christ as the door. In chapter ten the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;You Pharisees are thieves and robbers. You did not enter this sheepfold through Me. Moses, David, Elijah, Isaiah, and Jeremiah all entered the fold through Me. But you Pharisees entered the fold by climbing up elsewhere. Because you have stolen into the sheepfold, you are thieves and robbers.&#8221;<p>In John 10 the sheep are God&#8217;s chosen people (vv. 3, 5, 27). The sheepfold is the law or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God&#8217;s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came (vv. 1a, 16). The thieves and robbers are those like the Pharisees and the Jewish leaders who came into the sheepfold, but not through Christ (vv. 1b, 8). Now we need to go on to consider Christ as the door of the sheep.<p>The door of the sheep is Christ, the Son of God, for God&#8217;s chosen people to go in and go out of the sheepfold. In verse 7 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.&#8221; In verse 9 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>Not the Door to Heaven</h2><p>Some misinterpret the Lord&#8217;s word concerning Himself as the door and think that He is the door for us to go to heaven. According to their understanding, they would say that if we do not have the Lord Jesus, we do not have the entrance to heaven. This interpretation is mistaken. In verse 9 the Lord Jesus speaks about going in and going out. If the door here is the door to heaven, this would indicate that it is possible to go in and out of heaven. This would mean that the Lord Jesus is not only the door for us to go into heaven, but also that He is the door for us to go out of heaven. Surely this interpretation of Christ as the door is not correct.<h2 class=head2>The Sheep in the Fold</h2><p>If we read the context, we shall see that Christ is the door of the Old Testament sheepfold. When pasture is not available in the wintertime or in the night, sheep must be kept in a fold. Before the Lord Jesus came, God&#8217;s people were in the night. Therefore, God used the law to keep His chosen people and guard them in custody and ward until Christ came. Old Testament saints such as Moses, David, and Daniel were kept in custody in the fold. Hence, the Old Testament with the law as the center was the sheepfold in which God&#8217;s chosen people were kept as they waited for the time when they could come out of the fold and come into the pasture. While it was night, they needed the fold to shelter them.<p>All the Old Testament saints entered the sheepfold through Christ. This means that Christ was the door of the Old Testament sheepfold so that God&#8217;s chosen people could enter the fold and be preserved there. But now Christ is the door for the sheep to come out of the fold. This is the reason verse 9 speaks of going in and going out. First, God&#8217;s people in the Old Testament went into the fold. But when the Lord Jesus came, it was time for them to go out of the fold.<h2 class=head2>The Blind Man Cast Out of the Fold</h2><p>The blind man in chapter nine was among the chosen ones in the sheepfold. He may not have been willing to go out of the fold, but the Pharisees, the thieves and robbers, cast him out. We may say that they ushered him out of the sheepfold. But although the Pharisees cast him out of the fold, he actually came out through Jesus Christ as the door.<h2 class=head2>Enjoying Christ as the Pasture in the Daylight</h2><p>Throughout the centuries of the New Testament age, many &#8220;folds&#8221; have been established. Actually, every denomination and nearly every Christian group has become a fold. In the fold there is a shortage of light. Some of God&#8217;s chosen people are still in the darkness, even though the New Testament age is in the daytime, not in the nighttime.<p>Have you ever heard that for us who are enjoying Christ as the pasture this is the daytime? As one who is in the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, I do not have the sense that I am in the night. However, I did not have this feeling when I was in a denomination. But after I was brought by the Lord into the enjoyment of Christ, my night was turned to day. Has this not been your experience as well? Many of us can testify that in the church life we are in a spiritual day. Praise the Lord that we are in bright daylight! Inwardly we are filled with light, and outwardly we are surrounded with light.<p>However, in our daily experience sometimes we are still in the night. When we are strong in the spirit, we are in the day. But when we are in the flesh, we are in the night. In our spiritual experience the spirit is a day to us, and the flesh is night.<p>There is a hymn which speaks of Jesus as the wonderful Shepherd who brought us out of the fold into the pasture that is so good to our spirit.<p class=hbody>Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd,<br>Brought us right out of the fold<br>Into His pasture so plenteous,<br>Into His riches untold.</p><p class=hbody2>Glorious church life,<br>Feasting from such a rich store!<br>Here where we&#8217;re dwelling in oneness<br>God commands life evermore.</p><p class=hbody>In the divisions He sought us,<br>Weary and famished for food;<br>Into the good land He brought us,<br>Oh, to our spirit how good!</p><p class=hbody>Jesus Himself is our pasture,<br>He is the food that we eat;<br>We as His sheep are fed richly<br>Each time, whenever we meet.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #1221</p><p>A flock is in the pasture during the daytime. In a similar way, if in our Christian experience we are in the pasture, we shall also be in the daylight. The brightest time for us is when we are in the spirit enjoying the pasture. But our darkest time is when we are in the flesh. When we are in the flesh, we are full of lust, self, and the old man. What darkness that is! Praise the Lord that when we are in the spirit we are full of light!<p>Jesus Christ the Lord is life to us. According to John 1:4, this life is the light of men. Therefore, when we have life, we have light. Moreover, when we have light, we are in the day. We thank the Lord that sovereignly He has brought us out of the folds into the pasture and out of night into day.<h2 class=head2>A Change of Dispensation</h2><p>Some may think that because a sheepfold is something prepared by God we should remain there. They may point to chapter ten of the Gospel of John and ask, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the Old Testament sheepfold established by God? Certainly God established this fold. Why, then, didn&#8217;t the Lord Jesus leave His sheep in the fold?&#8221; The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed. During the time of the Old Testament, it was right for the sheep to remain in the fold. But the sheep should no longer stay there.<h2 class=head2>Religious Leaders Not Recognizing the Lord</h2><p>There are many religious things in the sheepfold. In the fold people may have the Scriptures, and in name they may also have God. But when the Son of God came, those in the Old Testament sheepfold did not recognize Him or receive Him, but rather rejected Him. The principle is the same with the sheepfolds that have been established after the Lord Jesus came. Those in today&#8217;s sheepfolds may talk about serving Christ, but some of them might not recognize Him if He appeared in their midst.<p>The religious leaders in the Old Testament sheepfold had strong religious teachings concerning Christ, the Messiah. But when Christ actually came, those religionists, who supposedly were for the Messiah, did not recognize Him. Instead of receiving Him, they rejected Him. This made it necessary for the Lord to be the door for His sheep to go out of the sheepfold. Through Him the sheep came out of the fold, not to enter another fold but to be His flock. In 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>The Difference between the Fold and the Flock</h2><p>A fold is a religious organization, and the one flock is the church. Because some Christians have not been clear concerning this distinction, they use the word &#8220;fold&#8221; when they should use the word &#8220;flock.&#8221; For example, a certain gospel song speaks of the &#8220;wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.&#8221; Actually, the Lord&#8217;s grace does not bring us into a fold. On the contrary, by grace the Lord brings us out of the fold into the flock. To be brought into a fold is to be brought into darkness. Grace does not bring us into darkness-grace always brings us into light. The church life is in the light, not in darkness. In the church life we are in the pasture under Christ as our sunshine. Now in the pasture and in the daylight, we enjoy Christ as life in every way.<h2 class=head2>Freedom from Legality</h2><p>The door in John 10 also signifies freedom. In Christ we have the freedom to go in and out. This means that we do not have any legality. The freedom we enjoy is Christ as our life-giver. Because Christ is our freedom, our door, nothing can bind us. We are not bound by any legality. This does not mean, of course, that we are free to indulge the flesh (Gal. 5:13). The point here is that in the church life we are in a condition where we are not in bondage to legality. Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom, and we are not bound by anything legal.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw from chapter ten the significance of the sheep (vv. 3-5, 27), the sheepfold (vv. 1, 16), the thieves and robbers (vv. 1, 8), and the door of the sheep (vv. 2, 7, 9). Let us now go on to consider other signs in this chapter of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE GOOD SHEPHERD</h2><p>The good shepherd is Christ, who laid down His psuche life for His sheep so that they may have the zoe life and may have it abundantly (vv. 2, 10-11, 14-15, 17-18). In 10:11 the Lord Jesus says concerning Himself, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; In verse 14 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me.&#8221; As the good Shepherd, the Lord laid down His life on behalf of the sheep. Today the Lord is still our Shepherd.<p>It is important for us to realize that the Lord shepherds us not in the way of outward activity, but that He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life. This means that the Lord shepherds us from within. Inwardly we have Him as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life. How does the Lord Jesus shepherd us? He shepherds us in life.<p>Verse 10 proves that the Lord Jesus shepherds us in the way of life: &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; The Lord Jesus is the good Shepherd to impart Himself as life to us. He laid down His psuche life so that the sheep may have His zoe life, and now He is shepherding us in the way of life.<p>We thank the Lord that Christ is our Shepherd and that we all are His sheep. Now we need to see that the Lord shepherds us by being life to us from within. We enjoy His shepherding when we live by Him as our life. On the one hand, the Lord lives in us. On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him. When we live in the Lord in this way, we are under His shepherding. As we are under the Lord&#8217;s shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life. The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way. For example, a young brother may want to participate in a certain form of worldly entertainment. However, through the life consciousness within him he may realize that the Lord is not leading him to do that. This life consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that this brother is under the Lord&#8217;s shepherding.<p>The sisters need to experience Christ&#8217;s shepherding in their shopping. Shopping can be perilous. Suppose a sister is eager for the opportunity to go shopping on a coming Saturday. The peril is that in her shopping she may fail to be in Christ and fail to be under His shepherding. Throughout the week this sister may remain under the Lord&#8217;s shepherding. But while she is shopping on Saturday she may come out from under this shepherding. Then on the Lord&#8217;s Day morning she may struggle to come back to the Lord, seeking mercy and grace from Him. In her shopping she lived in herself and by herself; she did not live in, with, by, and through the Lord. In a very real sense, she was her own shepherd, and shepherded herself in an unruly way.<p>The real Shepherd is the living Christ. As our Shepherd, the Lord not only gives us life-He also is life to us. The living of the Lord within us is actually His living shepherding. Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.<p>We need to use verse 10 as the key to interpreting every matter in chapter ten. In this verse the Lord says that He came that we may have life, the divine life, and that we may have it abundantly. This life is related to the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture. As long as we have Christ as life within us and we enjoy and experience Him as life, we shall have Him as the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture. The door will be our freedom, and the pasture will be our life supply.<p>The Shepherd, who is life to us, leads us, guides us, and directs us in everything. Therefore, we should not be directed by anything outward, but instead should be directed inwardly by Christ who is life to us. This Christ is our Shepherd, our Guide.<h2 class=head1>THE PASTURE</h2><p>In 10:9 the Lord says, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&#8221; The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available in the wintertime or in the night, the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitory and temporary. To be in the pasture to enjoy its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and to be under the law was transitory. Now, since Christ has come, all God&#8217;s chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture (Gal. 3:23-25; 4:3-5). This should be final and permanent.<p>The pasture is a place full of tender grass; that is, a pasture is a place full of the supply of life. When the sheep are in the pasture, they do not lack food. Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In our daily Christian life we need to have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.<p>Christ is our door, our Shepherd, and our pasture. As the door, He is our freedom, and as the Shepherd, He is leading, guiding, and directing us in life. Now we see that as the pasture Christ is our life supply. Day by day, we need to enjoy Christ as our pasture.<h2 class=head1>OTHER SHEEP</h2><p>The Lord in this chapter also unveiled to us that besides the Jewish believers as His sheep kept under the ward of law He has other sheep which are not of the Jewish fold, which are God&#8217;s chosen people among the Gentiles and which He must bring in (v. 16a). At that time this word was a prophecy which was fulfilled in Acts when Peter went to preach the gospel to the household of Cornelius, who were Romans (Acts 10), and when Paul went to preach the gospel to the Gentile world (Acts 13). Through the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, many were saved unto the Lord out of different tongues, and they all became the Lord&#8217;s sheep.<h2 class=head1>ONE FLOCK</h2><p>The Lord first called and brought His Jewish believers out of the fold of the Jewish religion, and after Pentecost He saved and brought many Gentile believers out of the Gentile world to make them all, both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd (v. 16b). This one flock is the one, universal church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6). It no longer belongs to the Jewish fold nor to the Gentile world, but stands by itself as the church of Christ set apart from the Jews and the Gentiles (1 Cor. 10:32).<h2 class=head1>ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>The Lord went on to tell us that His sheep hear His voice, and He knows them, and they follow Him; and He gives to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever (vv. 27-28a). Eternal life is the uncreated life of God, which the Lord released through His death (John 12:24) and imparted into every one of His believers through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). As this is the eternal life that lasts forever, so whoever possesses it shall by no means perish forever, that is, for eternity.<h2 class=head1>THE HAND OF THE SON</h2><p>In verse 28 the Lord kept saying, &#8220;And no one shall snatch them out of My hand.&#8221; This speaks of the Lord&#8217;s hand. His hand indicates the keeping power of the divine life.<p>In the New Testament the divine power, the divine strength, is related to grace. When Paul prayed for the removal of the thorn, the Lord said to him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:9). This indicates clearly that, according to the New Testament, strength is equal to grace. As we have mentioned a number of times, grace is God in Christ as our enjoyment. This powerful grace is the hand that holds us and preserves us. Therefore, the hand of Christ is actually the grace of Christ. We are upheld by Christ&#8217;s grace.<p>Many Christians know from reading John 10:28 that they are held by Christ&#8217;s hand, but they may not realize what this hand is. Some may say, &#8220;The Lord is almighty, and He is able to preserve us in all circumstances.&#8221; Yes, the Lord is almighty, but sometimes it seems that His hand does not keep us from certain things. For example, the Lord&#8217;s hand may not keep a sister from spending too much time in shopping, or keep a brother from participating in a certain form of worldly entertainment. How can we be preserved from such things? Actually, we are preserved not by the mighty Christ, but by the Christ of grace. This grace is the Christ who is the life we enjoy. This means that if we enjoy the Lord&#8217;s shepherding in life, in this life there will be a power to keep us from being snatched away by Satan.<p>Many of us would admit that in the past it seemed that we were kept away from the Lord by certain things. When we examine our experience, we shall realize that we were kept away from the Lord whenever we were not enjoying Christ as our life supply. Whenever we fail to enjoy Christ inwardly as our life supply, in a practical way we are not in the Lord&#8217;s keeping hand. Then the subtle one comes in and keeps us away. But when we enjoy Christ as life and are under His shepherding in life as we lie in the pasture and feed on the rich Christ, we are protected in the Lord&#8217;s hand of grace. Then nothing can snatch us away. We are preserved not by the almighty God; we are preserved by Christ, the life-giving Spirit, who is our life. As we enjoy Him and remain under His shepherding, we are kept in His hand.<h2 class=head1>THE HAND OF THE FATHER</h2><p>In verse 29 the Lord speaks concerning the Father&#8217;s hand: &#8220;My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand.&#8221; The hand of the Father, who is greater than all, signifies the keeping power of the divine love.<p>Elsewhere we have pointed out that grace and love are not two separate matters, but are two aspects of one thing. Love is in the Father. When this love reaches us in the Son, it becomes grace. When through grace we return to the Father, we enjoy His love.<p>Both grace and love are a matter of the Triune God being our life and enjoyment. As we enjoy Christ as our grace, we need to come to the Father, whose love is the source of grace. When we enjoy Christ as our grace, and then through this grace we contact God the Father as the source of grace, we experience love. The Father with His love is also the source of life, and the Son is the course of life. We may enjoy both the source and the course, for we may enjoy both the love of the Father and the grace of Christ.<p>Both the Son&#8217;s hand of grace and the Father&#8217;s hand of love are of the divine life. In the Father the divine life is the source, and in the Son this life is the course. In the Father the divine life is love, and in the Son the divine life is grace. Because we enjoy both the Son and the Father, we enjoy both grace and love. Therefore, we are in the course, and we are also touching the source. The result is that we are preserved, and nothing can snatch us out of these two hands, out of the Son&#8217;s hand of grace and the Father&#8217;s hand of love.<p>We sometimes sing of the glorious church life. However, for some of the saints the church life may be glorious at certain times, and at other times their church life may be gloomy. The reason is that these saints do not adequately enjoy Christ as life to be their door, their Shepherd, and their life supply. Because they do not have sufficient enjoyment of Christ in the way of life, they do not always have the Lord&#8217;s hand of grace and the Father&#8217;s hand of love upholding them in a practical way. If we do not enjoy Christ as grace, we shall not be able to go to the Father and touch Him as love. Then in our experience we shall be deprived of both the Son&#8217;s hand and the Father&#8217;s hand. As a result, it will be easy for us to be kept away by the enemy.<p>We all need to be protected in the hand of Christ&#8217;s grace and the hand of the Father&#8217;s love. When we are kept in grace and in love, nothing can snatch us away.<p>Chapter ten of the Gospel of John reveals that Christ must be everything to us. We should not have anything religious in our daily walk. On the contrary, we need to be wholly out of religion. As the blind man was cast out of Judaism, we need to be completely away from the elements of religion. To the blind man Christ became everything. Christ was his door, his Shepherd, his pasture, and the hand that preserved him.<h2 class=head1>THE FEAST OF DEDICATION</h2><p>John 10:22 says, &#8220;At that time the feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter.&#8221; In the foregoing message we pointed out that the feast of Dedication, also known as the feast of lights, commemorated the restoration and purification of the temple. During this feast, lamps were lighted in the temple and in the homes of the Jewish people. The feast of Dedication signifies Christ as the cleanser of God&#8217;s temple (see John 2:14-16; Matt. 21:12-13) and the light (John 9:5) of God&#8217;s people. If we would have Christ as the One who cleanses the temple and as the light of God&#8217;s people, we need to have Him as our life.<p>We all are temples of God (1 Cor. 6:19). However, because there is still some defilement in us, we need to be purified. The One who cleanses God&#8217;s people is the Christ who is life to us. If we experience Christ as life, we shall have Him as light and also as the purifier of God&#8217;s temple. Then in our experience He will purify us from all pollution and defilement, and we shall become a purified temple for God&#8217;s expression.<p>If we are enlightened as we read and pray-read John 10, we shall see that nothing religious is useful in serving a spiritual purpose. We need the living One, Jesus Christ, to be our life in every way. If we have Him as life, He will be our door, our Shepherd, and our pasture. If we have Him as life, we shall also have the keeping hands of the Son and the Father. Then we shall remain in Him and enjoy Him as everything. We shall have light, and we shall be purified to be God&#8217;s temple for His expression in His light. This is the revelation in chapter ten. We need to enjoy all these matters through pray-reading the Word with our spirit so that we may be fully released from the fold and from every element of religion and enjoy Christ as life in every way. Then we shall be full of light, and we shall be cleansed to be a temple for God&#8217;s expression.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 11:1-44</h1><p>The Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. This Gospel is also deep and profound in the matter of the divine life. The cases in chapters three through eleven give us a full picture of the divine life in its different aspects.<h2 class=head1>CASES IN CHAPTERS THREE THROUGH SEVEN</h2><p>The first case, that of Nicodemus, reveals how the natural man, no matter how good he may be, needs regeneration. The last case, that of Lazarus, indicates that we all are dead and in need of resurrection. Hence, the first case indicates regeneration, and the last case indicates resurrection.<p>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman who pretended to be religious and to be a worshipper of God. From this case we see that she needed the living water to satisfy the thirst in her human life and also needed the reality with which and by which to render God the kind of worship that satisfies Him. We all need Christ as the living water and as our reality. For our daily life we need a fountain of living water to satisfy our thirst, and for our worship of God we need Christ as the reality of all the offerings. If we have Christ as the reality of the offerings, we shall be able to offer God the Father the worship He is seeking.<p>In chapter five we have the case of the impotent man. Apparently, this is the case of a sick person. But according to the context of this chapter, we see that the Lord Jesus did not regard him as sick-He regarded him as dead. After the Lord enlivened the impotent man, He went on to speak about passing out of death into life: &#8220;Truly, truly I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life&#8221; (v. 24). Then the Lord spoke about two aspects of resurrection, the spiritual aspect and the physical aspect.<p>In 5:25 we have the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the spiritual aspect of resurrection: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.&#8221; In this verse the Lord refers not to those who are dead physically, but refers to those who are dead in spirit, as in Ephesians 2:1 and 5. Hence, in this verse to live means to be alive in spirit. This is not resurrection in the physical body, as mentioned in 5:28 and 29.<p>In 5:28 and 29 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth: those who have done the good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done the evil to the resurrection of judgment.&#8221; Those who are in the tombs are those who are physically dead and buried in the tomb. Hence, their coming forth from the tomb in verse 29 is the resurrection in the physical body.<p>The Lord&#8217;s work today is to resurrect those who are dead in their spirit. All of us were resurrected in spirit at the time of our regeneration. Once we were dead. But we heard the Lord&#8217;s voice, repented, and believed in Him. As a result, we were regenerated and spiritually resurrected.<p>As we have pointed out, verses 28 and 29 speak of the resurrection of those who are physically dead. &#8220;The resurrection of life&#8221; will be the resurrection of believers before the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16). The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Hence, it is called the resurrection of life. The &#8220;resurrection of judgment&#8221; refers to the resurrection of the unbelievers after the millennium (Rev. 20:5, 12). All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, it is called the resurrection of judgment.<p>Chapter five of the Gospel of John is actually a chapter dealing with resurrection in both a spiritual and physical sense. However, in this chapter the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect of resurrection. In the sight of the life-giving Christ, the impotent man, who had been sick for thirty-eight years, was dead. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus spoke to him, and he received the Lord&#8217;s word, he was resurrected. This was an instance of someone passing out of death into life.<p>In chapter six we have the case of a hungry multitude around the Sea of Galilee. The fact that the Lord Jesus fed this multitude indicates that He is the true life-feeder. The Lord Jesus said to the people, &#8220;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you&#8221; (6:27). This food is the Lord Jesus Himself. He is the bread of life, the living bread, the true bread of God that came down out of heaven (vv. 32, 33, 35, 51). Because the Lord is the bread of life, He can fill our hunger.<p>In chapter seven of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the case of the thirsty ones at the feast of tabernacles. At the feast of tabernacles the people enjoyed all that had been gathered in at the time of harvest. They enjoyed this rich ingathering with God and with one another. However, not even that enjoyment could satisfy them. Therefore, &#8220;on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (7:37-38). Here we have a word concerning the quenching of our thirst.<h2 class=head1>THREE BASIC PROBLEMS OF FALLEN MANKIND</h2><p>In chapter eight we have a case involving immorality; in chapter nine, the case of the blind man; in chapter ten, a further definition of the case in chapter nine; and in chapter eleven, the case of the death of Lazarus. In these three cases we have the matters of sin, blindness, and death, the three main characteristics of fallen human beings.<h2 class=head2>Sin</h2><p>Sin is one of the basic problems of fallen mankind. In chapter eight we have an instance of a particular act of sin. However, in this chapter the Lord Jesus goes on to speak regarding the sin that dwells in our nature. In 8:34 He says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.&#8221; This chapter reveals that the Son of God can set us free from the bondage of sin (v. 36). This bondage is not merely related to outward sins, to sins in our conduct, but it is related especially to inward sin, to the sin that dwells in our nature. Paul speaks very clearly about this indwelling sin in Romans chapter seven: &#8220;But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me&#8221; (v. 20).<p>In Philippians 3:6 Paul could say of himself that &#8220;as to the righteousness which is in the law&#8221; he had &#8220;become blameless.&#8221; But in Romans 7:7 and 8a we see that Paul could not overcome the inward sin of coveting: &#8220;What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet. But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind.&#8221; Paul may have succeeded in keeping the first nine of the Ten Commandments, but he had no way to keep the last one, the commandment concerning coveting. Paul came to realize that within his fallen nature there is something called &#8220;sin.&#8221; In Romans 7 he could say that this sin deceived him and killed him (v. 11), and that he himself was &#8220;sold under sin&#8221; (v. 14). Therefore, Paul could say, &#8220;For what I do, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do....So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me&#8221; (vv. 15, 17).<p>In chapter eight of the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus is actually dealing with indwelling sin. Some may claim that they do not commit sins outwardly, but who is without sin inwardly? Apparently, in your outward behavior, you may not commit sins. Nevertheless, you have sin dwelling in your nature. This indwelling sin brings us into bondage.<p>We need to be set free, delivered, from this bondage not by our own efforts but by the life-giving Christ. What we need is another life, a life that can overcome sin and also carry out God&#8217;s purpose and do His will. This life, the divine life, is Christ Himself. Therefore, we need Christ to be our life. If we have Christ inwardly as our life, then we shall be set free from the bondage of sin. The revelation in John 8 is that the Lord sets us free from the bondage of sin through being life to us.<h2 class=head2>Blindness</h2><p>Another basic problem of fallen mankind is blindness. Blindness issues in darkness. When we are blind, everything is in darkness. The case of the blind man in John 9 is the case of a man blind from birth (v. 1), not the case of someone who became blind due to illness.<h2 class=head2>Death</h2><p>As fallen people, from birth we all are sinful and blind. This means that we were born sinful and blind. Moreover, we were born dead. From birth we have these three basic problems-sin, blindness, and death. The gospel is preached not only to sinners who commit sins, but also to sinners who are sin. In ourselves we are sin, for we were born sinful. We were born sin. As we have seen, we were also born blind and dead; that is, we were born in darkness and in death. For this reason, in Ephesians 2:5 Paul says that God made us alive together with Christ, even when we were dead in offenses.<p>Because we were born sinful, blind, and dead, we need a gospel that can solve these problems. We need a gospel that can set us free from the bondage of sin and can give us sight. By receiving sight through the gospel, we also receive marvelous light to see the things concerning God and our destiny. We also need a gospel that can resurrect us. We need not only to be healed-we need to be resurrected. A salvation that frees us from sin, gives us sight and light, and resurrects us will usher us into God&#8217;s dwelling place and bring us into the Holy of Holies. Eventually, in the Gospel of John we are brought into the Holy of Holies. We are brought into the dwelling place of God.<h2 class=head1>JOHN&#8217;S INTENTION IN HIS GOSPEL</h2><p>In order to understand the Gospel of John, we need to know all the stories in this Gospel. However, it is not sufficient merely to know the stories. If we would get into the depths of the truth in this book, we need to have the extract of each chapter. All the messages in this series are actually concerned with the extracts of the Gospel of John. These extracts are related to the signs in this Gospel. John himself tells us that in writing this Gospel he selected certain signs performed by the Lord Jesus, signs that reveal different aspects of the divine life: &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name&#8221; (20:30-31).<p>The record in the Gospel of John is different from that in the so-called synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It is not John&#8217;s intention to describe the miraculous acts of Christ. Rather, John&#8217;s intention is to depict the divine life, portraying this invisible life through a number of visible cases. All these cases are signs.<p>In chapter eleven we have the case of Lazarus. In this chapter the Lord says, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221; (v. 25). Both resurrection and life are invisible. If we did not have a tangible case, we could not understand resurrection and life. Hence, here in this chapter is a specific case of a dead person who is resurrected. Through this case we can come to know what resurrection is. Actually, resurrection is the Person of the Lord Jesus Himself. This means that resurrection is not mainly what the Lord does; resurrection is primarily what the Lord is. Because Christ is resurrection, when we have Him, we have resurrection. When He is present, resurrection is present also.<p>In our study of the Gospel of John we need to see the significance of all the signs. Then we shall have the extract of this Gospel. Not only are the cases recorded in this Gospel signs, but the main points revealed in each chapter also are signs. For instance, in chapter eleven there are five main points: death, sickness, the Lord&#8217;s delay, men&#8217;s opinion, and resurrection. All these points are signs. Even the Lord&#8217;s delay is a sign. It is important that we understand what this delay signifies. The opinions expressed in this chapter are also signs. When we grasp the significance of these signs, we shall have the extract of this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF DEATH</h2><p>Let us now consider the signs in chapter eleven. The first of these signs is the sign of death. Death signifies the last of the negative things to be dealt with. This is proved by Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 15:26: &#8220;The last enemy that is being abolished is death.&#8221;<p>The last negative thing in us, the last problem that needs to be dealt with, is death. Many Christians know that they have weaknesses, but they are not conscious of the problem of death. In the sight of God, everyone is dying. As soon as an infant is born, that infant begins the process of dying. If we did not have eternal life, our whole being would be in this process of dying.<p>The older a person becomes, the more he thinks about dying. An elderly person knows that death awaits him. He realizes that most of the years allotted to him have been used up and that very little time is left. My point here is that, as far as the natural life is concerned, we all are dying. The more we realize this, the more we shall thank the Lord that we have eternal life.<p>Because we were born dead and because the element of death is in the fiber of our being, we need the Lord&#8217;s life-giving salvation. In John 11 death is a sign of the last negative factor that remains to be dealt with. This is the significance of the sign of death in chapter eleven of the Gospel of John.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 11:1-44</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in John 11.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF SICKNESS</h2><p>In 11:1-3 we see the sign of sickness. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Now there was a certain man who was sick.&#8221; In verse 3 the sisters of Lazarus sent word to the Lord Jesus and said, &#8220;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&#8221; Sickness is weakness leading to death. We may say that sickness is the calling card of death. This means that sickness indicates that death is coming. Once I saw human life pictured in this way: birth, old age, sickness, and death. After someone is born, he begins to age. Eventually, he will become sick and then die. Hence, sickness is an announcement that death is on its way.<p>Christians may realize that when we are sick, we are weak. However, we may not realize that this sickness, this weakness, is a sign of death. Whenever you say that you are weak, you need to realize that your weakness is the &#8220;calling card&#8221; of death, for death is behind your weakness.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S DELAY</h2><p>In 11:4-6 we have the sign of the Lord&#8217;s delay. When the sisters of Lazarus sent the news to the Lord Jesus that Lazarus was sick, no doubt their intention was that the Lord would come to heal him. However, when the Lord received this report, He did not do anything. Here we have the third sign in this chapter, the sign of the Lord&#8217;s delay.<p>What was the reason for the Lord&#8217;s delay? When I was young, I was told that the Lord delayed because He was testing their faith, because He was teaching them to believe. I do not think that this is the reason for His delay. The Lord&#8217;s delay in this chapter is a sign that the Lord did not want to be a healing Savior but a life-giving Savior. Healing corresponds to the natural thought, but life-giving is a divine thought. Many Christians have never heard about life-giving; they are not familiar with this term in the spiritual vocabulary. However, it is common for Christians to talk about healing. Do not misunderstand me and think that I do not believe in divine healing. I definitely believe in divine healing, and I myself have experienced it. The point here is that the concept of healing is natural, whereas the concept of life-giving is divine.<p>God&#8217;s intention is not merely to heal us, for in His sight we are not sick-we are dead. God&#8217;s salvation is not a salvation to heal the sick, but to enliven the dead. God&#8217;s salvation is to enliven the dead, to cause those who are dead to become alive. In 10:10 the Lord Jesus did not say, &#8220;I came that they may have healing, and have it abundantly.&#8221; In this verse He said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; This life is not psychological life (psuche) or physical life (bios); it is the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life of God (zoe), which is actually God Himself. The Lord came that we may have this divine, eternal life and have it abundantly.<p>In chapter eleven the Lord Jesus delayed until He knew that Lazarus had died. The Lord&#8217;s delay here is a sign indicating that He did not intend to heal the sick man and thereby only be a healing Savior; rather, it was His intention to raise the dead and thereby be a Savior who gives life. This was the reason the Lord did not come to do anything to heal Lazarus from his sickness.<p>The Lord Jesus waited not only until Lazarus had died, but even until he had been buried and had begun to stink. It is actually a blessing to be in such a condition, for then we are qualified for the Lord&#8217;s life-giving. The Lord will not resurrect a sick one; He will resurrect one who has died, who has been buried, and who has begun to stink.<p>In principle, we all have asked the Lord to heal us of certain &#8220;sicknesses.&#8221; After we were saved, we realized that we had certain defects and imperfections, and we wanted to improve ourselves. For example, many of us wanted to be &#8220;healed&#8221; by the Lord of our troublesome temper. After I was saved and began to seek the Lord, I realized that the main defect in my human life was my temper. Therefore, I made up my mind that I would never lose my temper again, and I asked the Lord to help me in this matter. In a sense, I sent word to the Lord that I was &#8220;sick&#8221; with the illness of my temper and that He should come to &#8220;heal&#8221; me. However, I can testify that the Lord did not come to heal me of this sickness. On the contrary, the more I prayed about my temper, the worse this sickness became. Just as the Lord did not heal Lazarus of his sickness, so He did not heal me of my temper. Many of us can give a similar testimony concerning our experience.<p>In John 11 Mary and Martha seemed to be saying to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, the one whom You love is sick. Lord, You are obliged by Your love for Lazarus to come and heal him.&#8221; However, the Lord set aside that request and delayed going down to Bethany.<p>The Lord&#8217;s disciples were not happy with this delay. We know this by the way the disciples responded to the Lord&#8217;s word to them, &#8220;Let us go into Judea again&#8221; (v. 7). When the Lord said this to them, the disciples replied, &#8220;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?&#8221; (v. 8). The disciples seemed to be saying to the Lord, &#8220;Why did You not go when the news came to You that Lazarus was sick? Why do You want to go now?&#8221;<p>Many things are exposed by the Lord&#8217;s delay. When we want to go, He does not want to go. But when we do not want to go, He wants to go. He will never take our way. Instead, we need to follow His way.<p>In our Christian life we have uttered a number of vain prayers. We may have prayed for the Lord to &#8220;heal&#8221; us in this manner or in that thing. But instead of healing us, the Lord allows us to become weaker. Eventually, we become weak to the uttermost and die. After we die and are buried and have begun to stink, that is the right time for Him to come to give us life. From experience we have learned that when we have become weak to the uttermost, weak to such an extent that we die, then the Lord will come not as a helper but as the life-giver.<p>The Lord&#8217;s desire as revealed in this chapter is not to help us, to be our helper; His desire is to be our life-giver. But unless we die, we shall not realize that we need Him as our life-giver. We may think that we need Him only to be our helper. Because we have this realization, we often ask the Lord to help us. However, often we have prayed to the Lord for help, but He did not come to help us. Like Martha and Mary, we sent news to the Lord about our sickness, expecting Him to heal us. But the Lord delayed before doing anything. The Lord always does things in His own time. When He knew that the time was right, He said to His disciples, &#8220;Let us go into Judea again.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF MEN&#8217;S OPINION</h2><p>When the Lord wanted to go into Judea, He encountered the frustration caused by man&#8217;s opinion. In other chapters of this Gospel the opposition to the Lord Jesus and the frustration came from those in the Jewish religion. But in this chapter the Lord Jesus was in Galilee, far away from Jerusalem, the religious center. In this chapter the frustration came not from the opposers in religion but from human opinion. The disciples were the first to express an opposing opinion (vv. 8, 11-16). They said to the Lord that the Jews were seeking to stone Him and therefore He should not go into Judea.<h2 class=head2>A Sign of Walking in Darkness</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word to His disciples in verses 9 and 10 indicates that their opinion was a sign that they were walking in darkness: &#8220;Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221; All opinionated persons are in darkness. Opinions are a sign of darkness because to utter an opinion is to speak nonsense. The reason a person speaks nonsense is that he is in the darkness. But the Lord Jesus is fully in the light, and He Himself is the light. Furthermore, whenever the Lord is present, there is day. In these verses the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &#8220;As long as I am here, you are not in darkness. I am the light. Since the light is here, it is daytime. I say that we should go into Judea. But if you say that we should not go, you are expressing a contrary opinion, and you are in darkness.&#8221;<p>Whenever we express an opinion that is contrary to the Lord&#8217;s will, that opinion signifies that we are not walking in the day but in the darkness. If we are following the Lord, we should say &#8220;amen&#8221; to whatever He says and not express any opinion. As long as we express an opinion of any kind, that opinion will be a sign that we are in darkness and that we do not know what we are saying. Only the Lord knows what to say. When He says, &#8220;Let us go,&#8221; that is something in the day, in the light. The Lord&#8217;s guidance always is light. If we follow His guidance, we shall be in the day, and we shall walk in the light. But if we follow our opinion, we shall be in darkness. Therefore, man&#8217;s opinion is a sign of darkness.<h2 class=head2>A Sign of the Frustration to the Lord&#8217;s Resurrection Life</h2><p>Men&#8217;s opinion is also a sign of the frustration to the Lord&#8217;s resurrection life (vv. 11-40). In verses 11 through 16 we see the disciples&#8217; opinion. When the Lord told them that He wanted to go into Judea, they should have immediately gone with Him. But instead they expressed their opinion, and this was a frustration to the Lord. In verse 11 the Lord said, &#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may awaken him out of sleep.&#8221; This word is the Lord&#8217;s revelation. But the disciples went on to expound this revelation in their own way: &#8220;The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover&#8221; (v. 12). This expounding of the Lord&#8217;s word made it necessary for Him to tell them plainly that Lazarus had died (v. 14). Eventually the Lord&#8217;s disciples followed Him to Judea.<h2 class=head2>Martha&#8217;s Opinion</h2><p>In 11:17-28 we see Martha&#8217;s opinion. Martha did not give the Lord an opportunity to say a word. Immediately she complained to Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died&#8221; (v. 21). Martha seemed to be saying to the Lord, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t You come earlier? If You had come four days ago, Lazarus would still be alive. But he is dead and buried. What is the use of Your coming?&#8221;<p>The Lord said to Martha, &#8220;Your brother shall rise again&#8221; (v. 23). Martha replied, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day&#8221; (v. 24). When the Lord said that Lazarus would rise again, He meant that Lazarus would be resurrected that very day. Martha, however, in her expounding of the Lord&#8217;s word, postponed this resurrection until the last day. Like Martha, sometimes we also explain away the Lord&#8217;s word. We may read something in the Scriptures and then say that this is not for our experience today, but for some time in the future. For example, some may claim that eternal life is only for eternity and not for our experience today. This is to explain away a word from the Lord that is meant for us to experience today.<p>After Martha had explained the Lord&#8217;s word about Lazarus&#8217; resurrection by saying that he would rise again in the resurrection in the last day, Jesus went on to say to her, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?&#8221; (vv. 25-26). Here the Lord Jesus spoke in the present tense, saying, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; The words &#8220;I am&#8221; indicate that He is Jehovah, the great I Am. With Him there is no time element. Because the Lord Himself is resurrection, whenever He is present, resurrection is there. The Lord seemed to be telling Martha, &#8220;There is no need for you to complain that I have come too late. I am the resurrection, and I am the life. With Me there is no element of time. Therefore, with Me there is no such thing as being too late.&#8221;<p>In verse 27 Martha again spoke to the Lord in an opinionated way. When she had finished speaking, &#8220;she went away and called her sister Mary, saying secretly, The Teacher is here and is calling you&#8221; (v. 28). There is no indication that the Lord had called for Mary. It is likely that this was initiated by Martha and that her word to Mary was yet another aspect of her opinion. Martha may have thought that it was not sufficient for her to talk to the Lord. She may have wanted her sister to join her in complaining about the situation.<h2 class=head2>Mary&#8217;s Opinion</h2><p>In 11:29-32 we have Mary&#8217;s opinion. In verse 32 she said, &#8220;Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>The Jews&#8217; Opinion</h2><p>Verse 33 says, &#8220;When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled&#8221; (v. 33). The Lord groaned in His spirit because He realized that no one, including Mary, knew Him. The Bible says that the Lord groaned in His spirit, not in His emotion. In His spirit He was one with God and was having fellowship with God. He realized the situation and perceived that everyone around Him, the unbelievers, Martha and Mary, and all the disciples, did not know Him. That was the reason the Lord groaned and even wept (v. 35).<p>Expressing their opinion, the Jews said, &#8220;Behold how he loved him! But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have also caused that this man should not die?&#8221; (vv. 36-37). These verses indicate that the Jews did not understand why the Lord wept. They thought that Jesus wept out of love for Lazarus. The Lord, however, did not weep for that reason. He groaned in His spirit and wept because of their ignorance of Him. None of them knew Him. At that very moment, the Lord was the resurrection and the life. But no one realized this. What a pitiful situation! The situation today is similar. Not many Christians truly know the Lord. Not many know Him as resurrection, as life, and as the present One.<h2 class=head2>Martha&#8217;s Opinion Again</h2><p>When they came to the cave where Lazarus was buried, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Take away the stone&#8221; (v. 39). But Martha, expressing her opinion again, said, &#8220;Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he has been there&#8221; (v. 39b). This opinion caused further frustration. If there had not been any opinion, it is likely that the Lord Jesus would have resurrected Lazarus at least half a day earlier. But all the different opinions delayed the resurrection of Lazarus.<h2 class=head1>A LIFE-GIVING SAVIOR</h2><p>Eventually, the Lord overcame all the opinions, and Lazarus came out of the tomb. This is resurrection. The resurrection of Lazarus is a sign indicating that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior, but is a life-giving Savior. The Lord wants to give us life, to resurrect us, not only to heal us. But in our concept we have the thought of healing, not the thought of life-giving. The reason we do not have the thought of life-giving is that we do not realize what our need actually is. We may think that our need is to be healed of our sickness. Actually, our problem is not merely sickness-our problem is death. Therefore, we need not only healing, but we need life-giving.<p>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John is a clear picture of all of us under the power of death. We have even begun to smell. Hence, we not only need healing; we need the Lord as the life-giver. We need Him to give us life.<p>All Christians appreciate the Lord Jesus as the Savior. However, not many appreciate Him as the life-giving Savior. Rather, they may only realize that as the Savior He is mighty, sufficient, and able. When I was young, I was not taught that Jesus Christ is our Savior in the sense of being the One who gives us life, that He saves us by giving life to us. We need the Lord not only as a mighty Savior; we also need Him as the life-giving Savior. Instead of merely asking the Lord to help you, ask Him to give you life. We need to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I need Your life-giving. Lord, impart Yourself into my being as life. I need You as my life. Lord, I&#8217;m not only sick and weak-I&#8217;m dying. My sickness is not a disease; my sickness is death. Therefore, what I need, Lord, is You imparted into me to be my life.&#8221; This is resurrection.<p>God&#8217;s salvation is a matter of resurrection, not a matter of healing. Regeneration is the initial stage of resurrection. Every aspect of God&#8217;s salvation involves resurrection. After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us. Eventually, the Lord will glorify us. That glorification will be the consummation of resurrection. God&#8217;s salvation, therefore, is a process of resurrection. He has resurrected us in our regeneration, and now He is continually resurrecting us through sanctification and transformation. Then as the consummation of the process of resurrection, He will glorify us.<p>Later on we shall see that chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John are in the Holy of Holies. Everyone who enters the Holy of Holies has not only been forgiven of his sins by God, but is also one fully resurrected from the natural life. Whoever enters the Holy of Holies must pass through the riven veil. This veil signifies our flesh, our natural man. The natural man must be set aside. Then when we come into the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be a natural man. Rather, we shall be a resurrected person, a person regenerated and transformed. In resurrection life we then may have direct fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies.<p>The Apostle John shows us that in order to come into the Holy of Holies, we need to begin our journey at the altar, at the cross. Then in life we need to experience Christ as the showbread table and the lampstand. When we enter the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be natural; we shall be fully in resurrection fellowshipping with our God. In this way we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:1-50</h1><h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NINE CASES</h2><p>In chapter twelve we have a conclusion of the first part of the Gospel of John. We have pointed out in previous messages that nine cases are presented in chapters three through eleven. The first is a case of regeneration, and the last is a case of resurrection. This is very significant.<p>All the cases in John direct us to a new creation. Mankind fell, and we became the old creation. No matter whether we are good or evil, as long as we are the old creation, we need Christ for our regeneration and resurrection. We were sinful and dead, and we need a new life, a new birth. We need to become a new creation. In order to become something absolutely new, we need to be regenerated and thoroughly resurrected from the old life. Then we shall become new, not in our natural life, in the Adamic life, but new in Christ and in the divine life, which is the eternal life of God. This is the significance of all these cases. Furthermore, as we shall see, in these cases we have the fulfillment of the offerings in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Dwelling Place</h2><p>In the Old Testament there was a center, and that center was God&#8217;s dwelling place. First, God&#8217;s dwelling place was the tabernacle, and later His dwelling place was the temple. Actually, the Old Testament is a history of God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>Apparently the book of Genesis has nothing to do with God&#8217;s dwelling place. In fact, the book of Genesis has much to do with the dwelling place of God. God&#8217;s dwelling place was not merely the tabernacle and the temple; His dwelling place was a people. The tabernacle and the temple were symbols of the children of God as His dwelling place. God&#8217;s people were descendants of the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose lives are recorded in the book of Genesis. Therefore, in Genesis we have the forefathers of those people who eventually became God&#8217;s dwelling place. The history of the Old Testament is a history of this dwelling place, which is symbolized first by the tabernacle and later by the temple.<h2 class=head2>The Need of the Offerings</h2><p>In order for God&#8217;s people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with Him, there was the need of the offerings. In front of the tabernacle was an altar, where different offerings were offered to God. These offerings were of five main categories: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.<p>Recently we gave a series of messages on the offerings printed as the book Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings. In those messages we pointed out that the burnt offering and the meal offering are a pair, that the sin offering and the trespass offering are also a pair, and that between these two pairs we have the peace offering. Furthermore, the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering. This means that only the One who is absolute for God is qualified to be the sin offering. As this absolute One, Christ is the burnt offering offered to God for His satisfaction. Hence, He is the One qualified to be our sin offering. This is clearly revealed in the book of Hebrews. The book of Hebrews indicates that Christ was the One who was absolute for God. Therefore, He was the unique One qualified to be the sin offering to deal with our sinful nature.<p>Just as the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering, so the trespass offering is supported by the meal offering. Christ, the only perfect One, was qualified to die for us and for our sins. As the meal offering, He was qualified to bear our sins, trespasses, and transgressions. He alone was qualified to redeem us. As the burnt offering, Christ was qualified to be the sin offering, and as the meal offering, He was qualified to be the trespass offering. This means that the One who was absolute for God was qualified to be our sin offering, and the One who was perfect in His humanity was qualified to be our trespass offering.<p>When we have Christ, the absolute One, for our sin offering to deal with our sinful nature and when we have Christ as the perfect One for our trespass offering to deal with our sinful deeds, we have no more problems. Then this Christ becomes our peace offering for us to enjoy with God and with one another as a feast. This means that the peace offering is a feast. When we come to the Lord&#8217;s table, we come to a feast, and this feast is Christ as our peace offering.<p>As the peace offering, Christ satisfies God, and He also satisfies us. Furthermore, He is the peace between us and God and our peace with one another. Christ is also the peace between a brother and his wife. Without Christ as the peace offering, there can be no peace between a husband and his wife. Without Christ, there would not be any peace among the brothers and sisters in the church life. Christ is our peace, and this peace becomes our enjoyment at the Lord&#8217;s table. Every week on the Lord&#8217;s day we come together to feast on Christ as the peace offering. We enjoy Him before God and with God, and we enjoy Him with one another. This peace offering is the issue of the other four offerings.<h2 class=head2>The Sin Offering</h2><p>Let us now consider how these five offerings are fulfilled in the cases recorded in chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John. With the case of Nicodemus in John 3, we have the sin offering. Nicodemus was a learned, aged, experienced, moral, religious, and God-fearing gentleman. According to his opinion of himself, he may not have been sinful. In a sense, Nicodemus was not sinful outwardly. However, he certainly was sinful inwardly. This was the reason the Lord Jesus spoke to him concerning the brass serpent (v. 14). It was as if the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &#8220;Nicodemus, you are very good in your outward behavior. But you still need Me to be the brass serpent as your substitute so that your serpentine nature may be dealt with. Nicodemus, you may say that you are good in your conduct and character, but you cannot say that you are good in your nature. In nature, Nicodemus, you are serpentine. You have been bitten by the old serpent, and his poison has been injected into your being. Therefore, in the sight of God, you are serpentine. As a teacher of the Jews, you must know chapter twenty-one of the book of Numbers. That chapter says that your forefathers offended God and as a result they were bitten by serpents. In the sight of God, they all became serpents who were dying. When Moses cried to God on their behalf, God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on a pole. That brass serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the nature of a serpent. But that serpent became a substitute for the people to bear their judgment. Whoever looked at that brass serpent was made alive. Nicodemus, I am the reality of that brass serpent. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must I, the Son of Man, be lifted up, so that whoever believes in Me may have eternal life.&#8221;<p>After the Lord spoke to Nicodemus regarding this matter, Nicodemus had nothing further to say. He understood the Lord&#8217;s word. In John 3 the brass serpent lifted up on a pole was the sin offering. This offering does not bear our sins; instead, it deals with the sin in our fallen nature.<h2 class=head2>The Trespass Offering</h2><p>In the next case, that of the Samaritan woman in chapter four, we have the trespass offering. Whereas Nicodemus was moral, the Samaritan woman was immoral, even though she was religious. The Samaritan woman had had five husbands, and she was now living with one who was not her husband. Because she was such an immoral person, she needed a trespass offering.<h2 class=head2>The Burnt Offering</h2><p>In chapter seven of the Gospel of John Christ is the burnt offering, the One who was absolute for God. As the absolute One, Christ was for God&#8217;s satisfaction, and He sought God&#8217;s glory.<h2 class=head2>The Meal Offering</h2><p>In chapter six we can see Christ as the meal offering. The meal offering in the Old Testament was made mainly of fine flour. In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread of God, the true and living bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 32-33, 35, 41, 51). Hence, He is the genuine meal offering to feed us.<p>In all these cases we have the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. If the Lord Jesus were not the offerings, He could not do anything for us, because between us and God there is the great problem of sin. The offerings deal with sin. Sins are the result, the outcome, of sin, and sin is the source of sins. If sin is dealt with, then sins will also be dealt with.<h2 class=head2>Entering the Tabernacle</h2><p>Because of the problem of sin, there was an altar near the entrance of the tabernacle. There was the need for the problem of sin to be solved in order for fallen people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with God. The tabernacle pointed to the fact that God was among the people. God&#8217;s dwelling place was on earth so that His people could enter into Him to enjoy Him and participate in all His riches. However, because sin has been injected into mankind, mankind is fallen, and all people have the problem of sin. This problem can be solved only by the altar, that is, by the cross. At the cross Christ offered Himself as our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.<p>With the case of Nicodemus we have regeneration. With the case of the Samaritan woman we see a person satisfied with living water and also obtaining the reality, the truth, with which to worship God. Then in chapters five through eleven we have the case of the enlivening of the impotent man in chapter five; the case of the satisfying of the hungry people in chapter six; the case of the thirsty ones satisfied and overflowing with rivers of living water in chapter seven; the case of someone freed from the bondage of sin in chapter eight; the case of the healing of the blind man in order to pass out of darkness into light in chapter nine; and the case of the resurrection of Lazarus in chapter eleven. When we put all these cases together, we can realize that apart from Christ as the offerings, it would not be possible for us to be regenerated, be satisfied with the living water, have reality for the worship of God, be enlivened, be nourished with living bread, have our thirst quenched and overflow living water, be freed from sin in order to be brought out of blindness, and be resurrected out of the tomb in order to become a living person. All this depends upon Christ as the offerings. This is the reason that in this Gospel we have the fulfillment of the offerings for us to enter into the tabernacle.<p>Perhaps you are wondering where you can find the tabernacle in the Gospel of John. In chapter thirteen there is the laver for our washing, and in chapters fourteen through seventeen we have the tabernacle with the incense altar. In chapter seventeen Christ our High Priest is interceding at the incense altar. In a later message we shall come to the laver in chapter thirteen. In this message we are still at the altar. However, as we come to chapter twelve, we are at the altar enjoying not the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, or the meal offering, but we are enjoying the peace offering in a little house in Bethany.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE HOUSE IN BETHANY</h2><h2 class=head2>Feasting on the Peace Offering</h2><p>The first sign in John 12 is the sign of the house in Bethany (vv. 1-3), a house that is a miniature of the church life. Bethany means the house of affliction. Yet there was a feasting with the Lord.<p>John 12:2 says, &#8220;So they made Him a supper there; and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.&#8221; Here we see that Lazarus was reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus and that Martha was serving. In verse 3 Mary did something to express her love for the Lord. But the important point here is that everyone in the house was feasting.<p>When Jesus was in that house in Bethany, God was there, for He is God incarnate. While that feasting was taking place in Bethany, the high priest and the other priests were serving God in the temple in Jerusalem. This means that two kinds of services were going on at the same time, one in Bethany and the other in Jerusalem. In the service in Bethany, Martha was serving, Lazarus was reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus, and Mary was anointing the feet of Jesus and wiping them with her hair. But in the service in Jerusalem the priests, clothed in long robes, were offering sacrifices and burning incense. Where was God at that time-in the temple or in the house in Bethany? The priests no doubt had the full assurance that they were worshipping God. But actually God was not there, for He was in Bethany. He was enjoying a service that had altogether no form or ritual. Instead of kneeling down before the Lord, Lazarus was reclining at the table with Him. According to 12:10-11, the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus as well as the Lord Jesus, because on account of Lazarus many were believing in the Lord.<p>The enjoyment in the house in Bethany was the outcome, the issue, of all the foregoing cases. The last case, that of Lazarus in chapter eleven, was a case of resurrection. Through His resurrection life the Lord gained a house in Bethany where He could feast and have rest and satisfaction. In that house in Bethany the Lord, God incarnate, and His disciples could feast together on the peace offering. This feasting in Bethany was the outcome of the foregoing nine cases.<h2 class=head2>The Result of Christ as the Offerings</h2><p>At this point I wish to emphasize the fact that in studying the Gospel of John we should not only read the stories in letters, but get into the depths of all the chapters and see the extracts. Here in chapter twelve we see a particular extract. This extract is that as the result of the nine cases in which we see Christ as the offerings, there is a house of feasting in Bethany. This house is composed of those who have been regenerated, freed from sin, healed of their blindness, and resurrected from death. Therefore, the result of Christ being the offerings is a household where His disciples may feast with Him as the incarnated God.<p>To be sure, the church life pictured by the house in Bethany was on a very small scale. Probably not more than twenty people were feasting together in the house. But although the scale was small, the reality was profound.<h2 class=head2>A Picture of the Church Life</h2><p>In this house in Bethany we have a miniature of the church life. Here we have a picture of the church life and also of the church meeting. Yes, the scale in John 12 is small, but the picture is perfect, complete. What is the church life according to the portrait in John 12? The church life is a life where some are serving the Lord, some are expressing their love for the Lord, and some are doing nothing except testifying of resurrection life. According to this picture, everyone is feasting with the Lord. This is the church life.<p>We have pointed out that while the Lord and the disciples were feasting in Bethany, the priests were worshipping God in a formal, religious way in the temple. The service in Bethany was on a small scale, but the religious worship in Jerusalem was on a grand scale. If you had been there at the time, where would you have gone to worship God? Would you have gone to the house in Bethany or to the temple in Jerusalem? I believe that, if we are honest, we shall admit that we would have gone to the temple in Jerusalem for the worship of God. In that house in Bethany there were no priests, and there was neither the altar with the offering of sacrifices nor the incense altar. Nevertheless, God was in that home in Bethany.<p>Because they had the Lord Jesus Himself with them, Lazarus, Martha, and Mary certainly would not have left Him to go to worship in the temple. They had been attracted by the Lord Jesus; He was a strong magnet drawing them to Himself. Who was this Jesus to whom they were attracted? He was the very God incarnate, that is, God in the flesh, God in humanity. This incarnated God was enjoying Himself with His disciples there in Bethany, and His disciples were enjoying Him with God and with one another. Together they were having a marvelous enjoyment. This is a picture of the church life.<p>In the miniature of the church life portrayed in John 12, we see three matters: serving, loving, and testifying. This miniature of the church life with these aspects is the issue of the Lord as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. Because the Lord is the reality of all these offerings, in John 12 we have Him as the peace offering. Let us, therefore, enjoy Him as the qualified One and as the One who satisfies both God and us.<p>I believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, no time was more pleasant to Him than that time of feasting in the house with Lazarus, Martha, and Mary and the others in Bethany. When He saw Lazarus testifying, Mary loving, and Martha serving, He was satisfied. In that He enjoyed a most pleasant time. This, then, is the first sign in John 12-a sign that portrays the church life in miniature.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:1-50</h1><p>In the previous message we saw that the first sign in John twelve is the sign of the house in Bethany, a house which is a miniature of the church life. In this message we shall go on to consider the other signs in this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTED LAZARUS</h2><p>The next sign in John 12 is the sign of the resurrected Lazarus (vv. 1-2, 9-11). This sign is a testimony of resurrection life. Verse 9 says that the people came &#8220;that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from among the dead.&#8221; Lazarus was a living testimony of resurrection life.<p>Actually, Lazarus did not do anything; he simply was a testimony of resurrection life. Martha was serving, and Mary was expressing her love for the Lord. Lazarus, however, was simply reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus. The testimony of Lazarus became the center of people&#8217;s attention. As a testimony of resurrection life, Lazarus attracted others.<p>The principle is the same today in the church life. The most attracting factor in the church life is our testimony of resurrection life. For example, someone may testify to his relatives, &#8220;You know what kind of person I was. You could even say that I was dead and buried. But now I am a resurrected person.&#8221; Today the Lord does not mainly want us to do things for Him. He wants us to be His testimony, a testimony of resurrection life.<p>To some extent, people are moved by Mary&#8217;s love. They may look at this dear sister and appreciate her love for the Lord. But the church life is not centered on this love. The center of the church life is a living testimony of resurrection life. This testimony, of course, is not of the natural life, but of a resurrected life, a new life.<p>I wish to emphasize the fact that the center of the church life must be persons living no longer by the natural life, but living by resurrection life. It is not necessary for a resurrected person to do anything. He may simply recline at the table, and others will be satisfied to see him.<p>We should not think that any kind of religious service can attract others. Neither should we think that our love for the Lord will be the primary attraction. If our love is not a love that comes out of resurrection life, it will never be a means of attracting people. The central attraction, which is also the focus of the church life, is resurrection life. If we all live this resurrection life, we shall become those who attract others to the Lord.<p>Other people appreciate resurrection life. If a young person tries to tell his parents how much he loves the Lord, this may offend them. Parents want to see that their child is living a certain kind of life. Your parents may not care about religious service or even appreciate your love for the Lord. But they will appreciate the fact that you are living another life, a resurrection life, a life that has brought you out of the tomb. Therefore, resurrection life should be our focus.<p>Sometimes certain people have advised me to give messages on a particular subject. For the most part I respond to these suggestions by saying, &#8220;There is no need for me to give messages on these subjects, for many others are speaking on these things. However, many Christians do not pay any attention at all to resurrection life. For this reason, I am burdened to minister life to the Lord&#8217;s people.&#8221;<p>Because it is our burden to minister life, our Bible studies are called Life-studies. Many years ago we coined the term &#8220;life-study,&#8221; realizing that what the children of God need today is a life-study of the Word. Because God&#8217;s people need life, year after year we publish the Life-study Messages. It is not our intention to pass on mere Bible knowledge that will cause others to exercise their mentality. Our goal is to minister resurrection life from the written Word to God&#8217;s people. This is what we need. We need resurrection life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF A GRAIN OF WHEAT</h2><p>The third sign in John 12 is the sign of a grain of wheat (vv. 23-26). In verse 24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; At the time the Lord spoke these words, many visitors had come to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Passover. Many wanted to see the Lord Jesus and Lazarus, and the name of the Lord Jesus became well known. At this time, &#8220;Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey&#8217;s colt&#8221; (vv. 14-15). A crowd took branches of palm trees, went out to meet Him, and cried out, &#8220;Hosanna, blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&#8221; (v. 13).<p>Not long afterward, certain Greeks who had come to Jerusalem to worship at the feast came to Philip and said, &#8220;Sir, we wish to see Jesus&#8221; (v. 21). Philip came and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus. No doubt, they were excited to see their Master exalted and gaining a great name. They were pleased that others wanted to see Him. However, the Lord Jesus did not take this opportunity to get a name for Himself. He answered Andrew and Philip, saying, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&#8221; (vv. 23-24).<p>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to His disciples, &#8220;I will not accept this kind of exaltation. After six days, I shall be crucified. I&#8217;m not here to be exalted-I&#8217;m here to die. I know that the hour is coming for Me to die. This is according to the will of My Father, and I shall not seek to escape it. I must die on the Passover as the Lamb of God. I am ready for crucifixion. This is not the time for Me to be exalted. Now is the time for me to fall into the ground and die as a grain of wheat. But when I fall into the ground and die, I will rise up with many grains.&#8221;<p>The Lord knew that the miniature of the church life in Bethany was very good. But that church life was too small and too limited. Hence, there was the need for Christ&#8217;s multiplication through death and resurrection. It was impossible, of course, for Lazarus, Martha, and Mary to produce this multiplication. This was the reason the Lord Jesus said that He would be a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die and then to bring forth many grains.<p>The Lord knew that through His death many things would be accomplished. However, most people think that nothing can be accomplished by death, for they regard death as the end, as termination. But with the Lord Jesus, death is not the end. On the contrary, by passing through death, He accomplished many things for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. Therefore, in John 12 the Lord Jesus was not willing to be exalted. That was not the time for exaltation. That was the time for Him to be sown into the earth as the grain of wheat to produce multiplication through death and resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 12:27-34 we have the sign of the all-inclusive death of Christ.<h2 class=head2>For the Release of the Divine Life</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s all-inclusive death was for the release of the divine life. Just as a grain of wheat releases its life by falling into the ground, so Christ released the divine life within Him through death. The life of a grain of wheat is concealed in the grain. Likewise, Christ&#8217;s divine life was contained and concealed within the &#8220;shell&#8221; of His flesh. Through His death on the cross, that shell was broken, and the divine life contained and concealed within it was released.<h2 class=head2>For the Glorification of God the Father</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death was also for the glorification of God the Father. In verse 28 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; This verse goes on to say, &#8220;There came then a voice out of heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&#8221; To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s divine element to be expressed. The Father&#8217;s divine element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son&#8217;s flesh had to be broken through death so that the Father&#8217;s divine element could be released and expressed in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by the breaking of its shell and expressed by its blossoming. When the divine life concealed within the Lord Jesus blossomed and brought forth many grains, that was the glorification of God the Father, the glorification of the divine life.<p>We may use a carnation seed as an illustration of the glorification of the Father through the death of Christ. If a carnation seed is kept in a package, nothing will happen to the seed. But if the seed is sown into the earth, that seed will release the life that is within it. After this life has been released, it will grow and eventually blossom. The blossom will be the glorification of the carnation seed.<p>When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh, He was like a carnation seed. Others regarded Him as nothing more than a Nazarene, for they did not know that the divine life was within Him. In order for this divine life to be released from within the Lord Jesus, it was necessary for Him to die. His death and resurrection was the glorification of the divine life, and this glorification was the glorification of God the Father Himself. This was the reason the Lord Jesus prayed in verse 28 for the Father to glorify His name, that is, to glorify His Person.<p>When the Lord prayed for the Father&#8217;s name to be glorified, the Father answered that He had glorified it and that He would glorify it again. Through Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death the divine life, the life of God the Father, was released. Then in Christ&#8217;s resurrection this life blossomed and was glorified. This is the glorification of God the Father, who was the divine life within the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>For the Judgment of the World</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s all-inclusive death was also for the judgment of the world. In verse 31 the Lord declared, &#8220;Now is the judgment of this world.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation, including our old man and the satanic world, was crucified with Him. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion was a termination of the satanic world. Therefore, in Galatians 6:14 Paul could say, &#8220;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&#8221;<p>Christ died an all-inclusive death. In the sight of God, that death may be compared to a great broom that God used to &#8220;sweep&#8221; the entire universe. Through the death of Christ on the cross, all the negative things, all the things of the old creation, were judged.<h2 class=head2>For the Casting Out of Satan</h2><p>In 12:31b the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.&#8221; This indicates that Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death was for the casting out of Satan, the ruler of this world. Satan thought that he was wise in having the Lord Jesus crucified. Actually, by doing this Satan caused himself to be destroyed. The cross was the way used by God to destroy Satan. Hence, through His death Christ destroyed Satan and his work (Heb. 2:14). Through His death on the cross Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who had the authority of death.<h2 class=head2>For the Drawing of All Men to Christ</h2><p>In 12:32 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&#8221; This indicates that Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death was for the drawing of all men to Himself.<p>All those who are drawn to Him eventually become the fruits produced by His death and resurrection. On the one hand, we are those who have been drawn to the Lord. On the other hand, we are grains produced by the death and resurrection of Christ. Praise the Lord that we are the grains and that we are the drawn ones! Praise the Lord that the church life has been multiplied! In fact, this multiplication is still taking place, for many are still being drawn to Christ.<p>What we have covered in the foregoing message and in this message is an extract of chapter twelve of the Gospel of John. In this extract we have a miniature of the church life, which is the outcome of Christ as the offerings. In this church life we enjoy Christ as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. The quality of this miniature of the church life in John 12 is perfect, but the quantity is too small, too limited. Therefore, there is the need of multiplication through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. The very One who is the offerings is here portrayed as a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to release the life from within Him to produce many grains. As we have pointed out, through His death many have been drawn to Him. Whoever is drawn to Christ will become a grain as Christ&#8217;s reproduction. These grains will be blended together to be one loaf, which is the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF RELIGION&#8217;S BLINDNESS</h2><p>In 12:35-50 we have the negative sign of religion&#8217;s blindness. In verses 35, 36, and 46 we see the rejection of the light, and in verses 37 through 50, the unbelief of the hardened heart. Religion always is a matter of blindness. If you are religious, you are blind. Religion may be the highest product of human culture, but as far as Jesus Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is concerned, religion is blind. Religion preoccupies people, veils them, and blinds them. In the previous message we pointed out that in the Gospel of John there were two kinds of worship: one in the temple in Jerusalem and the other in the house in Bethany. The worship in the temple in Jerusalem was religious, a worship according to religious regulations, rituals, ceremonies, and forms. The worship in the house in Bethany was without rituals, regulations, or forms. Where was God at that time? He was not in the midst of the formal worship in the temple in Jerusalem; rather, He was in the midst of the informal feasting in the house in Bethany.<p>According to John 12, those who were blinded by religion were even plotting to kill the incarnated God and also Lazarus, one of those who were enjoying Him. Do not think that the religious situation is different today. In principle, it is the same now as it was in John 12. We know this from our own experience. Although we love the Word of God and spend much time in it, we are criticized, slandered, and falsely accused. We are opposed by certain ones who do not see the matter in the Scriptures concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being to be our life and life supply so that we may be His expression. Today also, the religious ones are blind and hardened in heart. This is the significance of the sign in John 12 of religion&#8217;s blindness.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38</h1><h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2><p>With this message we come to chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John. It may seem to us that what is recorded in this chapter is not of great importance. Actually, this chapter is crucial, for it is a link that connects chapters one through twelve with chapters fourteen through twenty-one.<h2 class=head2>A Brief Sketch</h2><p>Chapters one and two of John&#8217;s Gospel give us a brief sketch of the entire book. Chapter one may be considered a prologue to the Gospel of John. Then in chapter two we see that the principle of life is to change death into life (2:1-11) and that the goal of life is to raise up the house of God that had been destroyed and enlarge it into the mysterious and mystical Body of Christ (2:12-22). Hence, in these two chapters we have the prologue to the entire Gospel, and we see the principle and goal of life.<h2 class=head2>Nine Cases</h2><p>In chapters three through eleven we have nine cases. These cases indicate that all of our needs have been met by the One who came that we may have life (10:10). The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection. Regeneration is actually the first step of resurrection. These nine cases depict one complete person who is in the new creation, a person who has gone from regeneration to resurrection.<h2 class=head2>The Way for the Church to Be Enlarged</h2><p>In chapter twelve we see that these nine cases result in a house at Bethany, which represents the church life in miniature. This indicates that out of the nine cases the church life is produced. However, the church life in John 12 is too small. In quality it is adequate, but in quantity it is too limited. With the miniature of the church life in Bethany we see service with Martha, love with Mary, and the testimony with Lazarus. Through the testimony of the resurrected Lazarus, many people were drawn to the Lord Jesus.<p>In chapter twelve of John a large crowd was drawn to the Lord (v. 18). However, He told His disciples that He was not willing to accept exaltation from the crowd. The Lord Jesus knew that exaltation cannot multiply the church life. The church life can be multiplied only through death and resurrection. Therefore, the Lord refused to take the opportunity to be exalted. Rather, as a grain of wheat, He said that He would fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains for the enlargement of the church life: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&#8221; (v. 24).<p>The Lord&#8217;s death was also for His glorification and for the glorification of the Father. This was the reason the Lord said, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified&#8221; (v. 23). It was also the reason He prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name&#8221; (v. 28).<p>Furthermore, the Lord&#8217;s death was the judgment of the world and its ruler, Satan: &#8220;Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&#8221; (v. 31).<p>Regarding His death, the Lord went on to say, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself&#8221; (v. 32). This reveals that through His death many would be drawn to the Lord in order to be regenerated and resurrected into the church life. It is in this way that the church is enlarged.<h2 class=head2>The Need of the Laver</h2><p>By the time we come to chapter twelve all the offerings have been fulfilled: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. Although the ones in the house in Bethany were feasting with the Lord Jesus and were enjoying the peace offering, they were still in the outer court, around the altar. They had not yet come into the Holy Place. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord to accomplish something further to bring them into the Holy Place.<p>In the nine cases recorded in chapters three through eleven, plus the record concerning Bethany in chapter twelve, we see the fulfillment of the offerings. All the offerings have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality. He is the real sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. However, it was still necessary for Christ to prepare the place and cut the way for His believers to enter into the tabernacle. Concerning this, chapter thirteen is of vital importance, for it is a dividing line and a turning point.<p>According to the type in the Old Testament, between the altar of burnt offering and the tabernacle was the laver. The laver was a place where the priests washed their hands and feet. It was necessary for those who had come to the altar and who were ready to enter the tabernacle to come to the laver to be washed.<p>We have seen that in chapters three through twelve the people have to come to the altar, where they enjoy Christ as the offerings. Now they are ready to enter into the tabernacle. But for this there is the need of washing. Therefore, the washing in chapter thirteen is the turning point, for it brings us from the outer court into the tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>LOOKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF JOHN&#8217;S WRITINGS</h2><p>In their reading of John 13 many Christians pay attention to the matter of foot-washing. No doubt, this chapter is a record of foot-washing. But what does this foot-washing signify? When I first came to the United States, I was asked by a certain believer if we practiced foot-washing. The one who asked me this question was a member of a foot-washing group, a group that emphasized foot-washing to such an extent that they believed it was not possible to be a proper church apart from this practice. I was somewhat bothered by his question. I realized that although we certainly are not a foot-washing group, there have been occasions when we literally washed one another&#8217;s feet. However, that was not done as a legal practice, but was done according to the inner leading of the Spirit. I mention this incident as an illustration of the fact that many Christians read the Bible only according to letters in black and white. Reading the Gospel of John in this way, they may completely miss the significance of foot-washing in chapter thirteen.<p>The Gospel of John is a book of divine life. As such a book, this Gospel begins like this: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221; (1:1). Surely this opening word indicates that the Gospel of John is a book that is concerned with profound matters. Chapter one goes on to tell us that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality, and that the disciples beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father. All this is profound. What is the beginning in verse 1, and what is the Word? What does it mean to say that the Word became flesh and that it tabernacled among men? What is the significance of the incarnated Word being full of grace and reality? What is the glory beheld by the disciples? We may also go on to ask the significance of regeneration in chapter three and of resurrection in chapter eleven. We need to be impressed with the fact that all these matters are deep and profound.<p>Because the Gospel of John deals with such profound things, we should not be satisfied with a superficial understanding of it. John&#8217;s writings are deep, and we need to delve into them. If we look into the depths of the writings of John, we shall see many precious things. These precious things, which include the extracts, are found only in the depths, not on the surface. Therefore, we should not be content to read and understand the Gospel of John in a superficial way.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE LORD</h2><p>John 13:3 says, &#8220;Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&#8221; This verse says that the Father had given all into the hands of the Lord Jesus. What does &#8220;all&#8221; mean? In this verse all means all things and all people. Hence, the Father has given into the hands of the Lord Jesus all things and all people. If we would understand the significance of the foot-washing in this chapter, we need to know this all-inclusive Lord, the One to whom the Father had given all things and all people. Because the Lord Jesus knew that the Father had given all into His hands, He washed the disciples&#8217; feet. The One who washed their feet was the One who had received such a great commission.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THAT HE HAD COME FROM GOD AND WAS GOING TO GOD</h2><p>Verse 3 also tells us that the Lord Jesus knew that He had come forth from God and was going to God. The Lord came from a wonderful source-the almighty, infinite God. The Lord&#8217;s source was not Nazareth, Bethlehem, or even heaven. As the One who came from the source of the almighty, infinite God, the Lord washed the feet of His disciples.<p>Furthermore, verse 3 tells us that the Lord Jesus knew that He was going to God. It is significant that in chapters thirteen through seventeen of this Gospel the word &#8220;heaven&#8221; is not mentioned. We are told not that the Lord Jesus came from heaven and that He was going to heaven, but that He came forth from God and was going to God. However, due to the influence of traditional religious interpretation, we are accustomed to saying that the Lord came from heaven and was going back to heaven. According to verse 3, the Lord came from God as His source, and now He was returning to this source.<p>In 13:3 we see three factors related to the Lord&#8217;s washing His disciples&#8217; feet: first, that all things and all people had been committed to Him by the Father; second, that He had come forth from God; and third, that He was going to God. These three factors indicate that the Lord Jesus is a great Person. Surely, as such a great Person, He had come to accomplish something great. He did not come into the world simply to pay us a visit. No, the Lord came because He was commissioned to accomplish a great thing.<h2 class=head1>THE COMMISSION THE LORD RECEIVED FROM THE FATHER</h2><p>When verse 3 says that the Lord Jesus knew that He was going to God, this indicates that He had fulfilled the purpose for which He had come from God. The Lord Jesus had come from God, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and now He was going back to God. Certainly, He had come to do something on earth. The fact that He was going to God indicates that this purpose and commission had been accomplished.<p>The Lord Jesus had been commissioned by the almighty, infinite God. Hence, the One who commissioned the Lord was great, and the commission given to Him was also great. What was this commission? What did the Lord Jesus come to accomplish? Different answers can be given to these questions. Some may say that the Lord came to accomplish redemption; others, that He had been sent to bring God into man. The commission God the Father gave to His Son was divine and mysterious. The commission was to bring fallen, natural, sinful, satanic, and demonic man into the holy, glorious, infinite God. This is what the Lord came to accomplish.<p>The commission the Lord Jesus received from God the Father was to bring us into God. Do you realize what we are in ourselves? We are natural, fallen, sinful, satanic, and demonic. Furthermore, in ourselves we are in sin, blindness, and death. But the Lord Jesus was commissioned by the Father to come to earth in order to bring such people out of sin, darkness, and death into the almighty, infinite God. This was, and still is, the Lord&#8217;s commission.<p>In verse 3 the word &#8220;knowing&#8221; means realizing. The Lord Jesus realized that all things and all people had been committed to Him. He also realized that He had come from God for the accomplishment of the commission given to Him and that now He was going back to God. Knowing all this, He washed the feet of His disciples. This indicates that foot-washing is a matter of great significance.<h2 class=head1>LOVING THE DISCIPLES TO THE UTTERMOST</h2><p>In 13:1 we see that the foot-washing in chapter thirteen is also related to the Lord&#8217;s love for His disciples: &#8220;Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.&#8221; Verse 1 says that the Lord loved the disciples to the uttermost. This love to the uttermost is related to foot-washing. To be sure, the Lord manifested His love for us by dying on the cross for us. Nevertheless, not even that love was called love to the uttermost in the Bible. The uttermost love was the love shown in washing the feet of His disciples. This is a further indication of the importance of foot-washing. In the next message we shall consider the sign of foot-washing (vv. 1-11) and the sign of brotherly love in foot-washing (vv. 12-38).<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that before the Lord Jesus washed His disciples&#8217; feet, He realized that the Father had given all things and all people into His hands, that He had come forth from God, and that He was going to God (13:3). We have also seen that the commission the Lord Jesus received from the Father was to bring fallen mankind into God. When the Lord was about to wash His disciples&#8217; feet, they had not yet been brought into God. Rather, they were still at the altar in the outer court. They had not yet come into the tabernacle. In order to come into the tabernacle, they needed the washing of their feet.<p>There is a hymn that speaks of passing the outer court, the outer veil, and the inner veil (Hymns, #551). This is related to the tabernacle and the outer court. The outer veil was the veil at the entrance to the Holy Place, and the inner veil was the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, this inner veil was torn from the top to the bottom (Matt. 27:51).<p>Spiritually speaking, in chapter thirteen of John the disciples were neither in the Holy of Holies nor in the Holy Place; they were still in the outer court. Their sins and sin had been dealt with by the offerings. However, because they were still unclean due to the earthly touch, they needed the washing of the laver before they could enter the tabernacle. Without this washing, certain frustrations or hindrances would have remained. Hence, there was the need for all earthly defilement to be washed away. This defilement is removed by foot-washing.<h2 class=head1>ONE FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>We have seen that in washing His disciples&#8217; feet, the Lord loved them to the uttermost (v. 1). The purpose of foot-washing was to keep the disciples in constant fellowship with God and with one another. Apart from foot-washing, there is no way for this fellowship to be maintained.<p>In the church life often there are problems between the brothers. None of us can say that he has never had a problem with another saint in the church. Although we may have problems with one another, we may try to act polite. But if the problems are not dealt with, they will eventually become problems between us and God.<p>Do not think that a problem you have with a brother is simply a problem between you and him. If that problem is not taken care of, it will become a problem between you and God. For example, having a problem with a brother may hinder you from praying properly. This problem between you and the brother keeps you out of God; that is, it keeps you outside the tabernacle and at the altar. By this we see that even a small problem with a brother can keep us from entering the tabernacle. Therefore, we need the washing in the laver.<p>If we do not have the washing, both our fellowship with the brothers and our fellowship with God will be broken. We cannot maintain our fellowship with God if the fellowship with our brothers is broken. We need to be impressed with the fact that there are not two fellowships. There is not one fellowship with God and a different fellowship with the brothers. No, our fellowship with the brothers is actually part of our fellowship with God. Therefore, we should not regard our fellowship with God as one thing and our fellowship with the brothers as another thing. This fellowship is absolutely one matter. Hence, if our fellowship with our brothers is broken, that means our fellowship with the Father is also broken. At least, one link of this fellowship is broken. In order for our fellowship with God to be broken, it is not necessary that every link be broken. It is enough that just one link is broken. By this we see that a problem with a brother or sister can cause our fellowship with God to be broken. A problem with another saint hinders us from entering the tabernacle.<p>Whenever our fellowship has been broken, we need foot-washing in order to recover this fellowship. You may not have any problem with God directly. But you may have a problem with God indirectly through the problem you have with your brother. The problem with your brother also becomes a problem between you and God. This indicates that we need foot-washing in order to maintain our fellowship with God and with one another. Day by day, we all need foot-washing. However, many Christians do not realize what the significance of foot-washing is.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF BROTHERLY LOVE IN FOOT-WASHING</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s washing the disciples&#8217; feet was a matter of love to the uttermost. After He washed their feet, He charged them to do the same to one another: &#8220;If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet. For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you may do also&#8221; (vv. 14-15). To wash one another&#8217;s feet, therefore, is a matter of brotherly love.<p>The commandment to love one another is the unique commandment in the New Testament. This commandment was first given in John 13, the chapter on foot-washing: &#8220;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another&#8221; (v. 34). The commandment to wash one another&#8217;s feet is related to the commandment to love one another. Today Christians talk a great deal about brotherly love, yet not many realize that brotherly love is expressed in foot-washing. If we do not have the reality of foot-washing, we actually do not have brotherly love. If we love one another, we need to wash one another&#8217;s feet. Without foot-washing, there is no brotherly love. The Lord Jesus loved His disciples to the uttermost, and this love is seen in His washing their feet. Now we also need to love the brothers in washing their feet.<p>Perhaps you are wondering what we mean by foot-washing, since it is not our intention to become a foot-washing group, a group that has the requirement of practicing literal foot-washing. I think that the best way to explain what we mean by foot-washing is to use an illustration from our experience in Shanghai in 1948.<p>In two consecutive meetings of a conference a particular sister prayed in an offensive, unseemly manner. All the leading ones felt that in her praying this sister went too far, overstepping others. After she prayed this way the second time, we felt that we could no longer tolerate the situation. As some of us were fellowshipping after the meeting, we were wondering what to do. Brother Watchman Nee asked me to write a note to that sister. In that note we pointed out to her that in her prayer she had gone too far. In love we asked her not to pray that way again. We closed the note with the words, &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s grace be with you.&#8221; This letter was then signed by Brother Nee, an elderly sister who was a co-worker, and me. The person to whom that note was addressed was Brother Nee&#8217;s mother.<p>After the note was delivered, I was concerned about what the result would be. The next evening we were again meeting together, this time before the meeting. That elderly sister came to the door and spoke one sentence to us: &#8220;Foot-washing is good, but the water was too hot!&#8221; Then she walked away to the meeting hall.<p>The note that was written to that sister is an illustration of foot-washing. This loving activity can be found only in the proper church life.<p>In human society, including organized religion, there is no such thing as foot-washing. In both secular and religious society, people behave in a political way. Instead of foot-washing, there is backbiting. People may be nice to you, but they may criticize you behind your back. No one will wash your feet, and neither will you wash someone else&#8217;s feet. In order to be a member of a denomination, there is no need to practice genuine foot-washing. It is sufficient to be well-mannered and polite. However, those who behave in such a way may be filled with complaints about others. This should not be our practice in the church life. If we are political in the church life, we are through with the fellowship. If instead of washing one another&#8217;s feet we are polite and political, the defilement on us will make fellowship impossible.<p>Neither in secular society nor in religious society is there fellowship. But the church life requires fellowship, a fellowship that is crystal clear. Only by foot-washing can our fellowship with God and with one another be maintained.<p>Suppose we in Shanghai had done nothing about our feelings concerning the way that elderly sister prayed in the meetings. Suppose we had said nothing, and kept the feeling within us. If we had done that, that feeling eventually would have destroyed the fellowship between us and that sister. Furthermore, our fellowship with God would have been frustrated.<p>Because of the lack of foot-washing, there is not proper fellowship among many Christians today. Instead of being crystal clear, the situation is opaque. Furthermore, certain feelings are concealed within the hearts of the saints. As a result, there is no crystal clear fellowship among the believers. Such believers may not even be in the outer court of the tabernacle.<p>Although we may experience all the matters revealed in chapters three through twelve of the Gospel of John, we still need the foot-washing in chapter thirteen. It is not sinful for our feet to be unclean. For example, it was not sinful for the leading ones to be bothered by the way that sister prayed in the meetings. But that feeling was a frustration to our fellowship. We all felt that we should write that sister a note in order to wash her feet.<p>I wish to point out that she was not offended by what we did. I can testify that afterward this elderly sister and I became quite close. This is a proof that she was helped by the note we sent her. Yes, when she first spoke to us about it, she complained that the &#8220;water was too hot.&#8221; I also had the feeling that the water was too hot. I would have preferred to have spoken to her directly. However, because Brother Nee was taking the lead and because this situation concerned his own mother, I did not want to express my opinion. In this matter, Brother Nee set an example of the way to deal with relatives, and we all learned much from it. No one was hurt, and the &#8220;muddy&#8221; situation was cleared up. This illustrates that in the church life we need foot-washing to clear away everything that hinders our fellowship with one another.<p>In the past we have also had some experience of literal foot-washing. One day, I believe in 1954, the elders in the church in Taipei were led of the Lord to wash the feet of all the brothers. That literal foot-washing recovered many who were weak. Although we washed the brothers&#8217; feet on that occasion, this has never been a regular, ordained practice. But spiritually we need to wash one another&#8217;s feet all the time.<p>One way to practice spiritual foot-washing is to be frank with one another. We may say that frankness is equal to foot-washing. This does not mean, of course, that we should rebuke others out of anger. But it does mean that we may wash one another&#8217;s feet by speaking frankly to one another. If we do this, the situation among us will be clear, and we shall have excellent fellowship with one another. Furthermore, if our fellowship with one another is clear, our fellowship with God will also be clear. This will strengthen our spirit, cause us to grow in life, and truly build us up together. In the church life we need such a spiritual foot-washing all the time.<p>Instead of washing one another&#8217;s feet, some brothers in the church life are political or practice politeness. For example, suppose brother A is having fellowship with brothers B and C. Brother A may be very nice to brother B and speak politely to him. Nevertheless, the fellowship between them is not genuine. After brother B leaves, brother A may turn to brother C and tell him that brother B is hypocritical. What should brother C do in this situation? He should look to the Lord for His grace and then, in love, speak a frank word to brother A and say, &#8220;Brother, you said that this brother is hypocritical. But when he was here, you were very nice to him. Now you tell me that he is a hypocrite. Brother, you are not being honest. Whether this brother is hypocritical or not, I do not know. However, I am certain that your behavior is not genuine. If this situation is not cleared up, how could all of us have the peace to attend the Lord&#8217;s table meeting together?&#8221; To speak in such a frank, honest way with a pure spirit is to practice foot-washing.<p>We have pointed out that in both secular and religious society today, there is no foot-washing. Suppose brothers A, B, and C are members of a religious organization. Brother C may hear brother A&#8217;s criticism of brother B. But instead of saying anything honestly to brother A, he may first keep the matter to himself. Later, he may go to brother D and tell him about brother A. This kind of behavior is common in human society, including religious society. In the church life our practice must be different. We need continual foot-washing in order to maintain our fellowship.<p>It is not easy to wash someone&#8217;s feet. Neither is it easy to have our feet washed. In other words, it is difficult to be either a washing one or a washed one. This is the reason that many behave in a political way and do not wash the feet of others.<p>Sometimes others are offended when we wash their feet. At least a few times I have offended saints simply because I washed their feet. Because others may be offended by our foot-washing, we should never be in a hurry to practice this. If we would wash someone&#8217;s feet, we need much grace. We also need to be clean ourselves. It is easy for the flesh to come in while we are dealing with someone else&#8217;s defect. Therefore, we need to be careful to be absolutely in the Spirit.<p>It is just as difficult to receive foot-washing as it is to administer it. If we are willing to be washed, we shall be blessed. We need mercy and grace both to wash another&#8217;s feet and also to receive the washing of our own feet.<h2 class=head2>To Receive Blessing</h2><p>In 13:17 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&#8221; This indicates that to practice foot-washing is to receive blessing. However, if instead of practicing foot-washing, we conceal within us our feelings concerning the defects of the brothers and sisters, there will be much accumulation of dirt to hinder our fellowship. If we know the significance of foot-washing and practice it, we shall be blessed. Foot-washing is a way to receive blessing.<h2 class=head2>To Sift the False One</h2><p>Foot-washing also sifts the false one (13:18-30). Among Christians today there are many tares, many false ones, because spiritual foot-washing is not practiced. But whenever we practice this foot-washing, the false ones are exposed.<p>Chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John puts together three matters: foot-washing, Judas&#8217; betrayal of the Lord, and Peter&#8217;s self-confidence. The fact that these matters are put together indicates that foot-washing sifts the false one and also exposes the real, yet self-confident, one. Among those who claim to follow Christ, there are two problems related to fellowship. These problems are falsehood, signified by Judas, and self-confidence, signified by Peter. Today&#8217;s society is full of falsehood and self-confidence. Peter was genuine, but with his genuineness there was self-confidence.<p>The best way to keep the false ones away from the church life is to practice foot-washing. The more we practice foot-washing, the more the false ones will be sifted. Because foot-washing exposes, the false ones cannot stand it. It is possible to be a false one at a love feast, but it is not possible to be a false one when foot-washing is practiced. Only the genuine ones can receive foot-washing. The false ones cannot tolerate it.<p>If a local church practices foot-washing, no false one will be able to remain. Foot-washing closes the door to every false one. The reason today&#8217;s religion is full of false ones is that there is no practice of foot-washing. Instead of foot-washing, there is politics, and politics produces false ones.<p>False ones are also produced by politeness. Some may be troubled to hear that politeness produces false ones. If you turn to your spirit, stay in the spirit, and live and walk according to the spirit, I doubt that you will be merely polite. I believe that you will see that the Spirit leads you only to be genuine, humble, frank, and upright. Politeness, on the contrary, may be only beautified hypocrisy. If you try to be polite, what you are actually doing is beautifying your hypocrisy. This can be compared to a mortician applying cosmetics to a dead body. In human society today, there is a certain kind of beauty, but this beauty is that of cosmetics applied to a dead body. Politeness may be nothing more than dead beauty.<p>We have seen that foot-washing exposes the false ones and does not allow them to remain. It was at the time of foot-washing that the Lord Jesus released the word that Judas would betray Him. Instead of concealing the matter, the Lord released what was on His heart. Concerning Judas&#8217; betrayal, the Lord Jesus was troubled in spirit: &#8220;When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in the spirit and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me&#8221; (v. 21). The Lord Jesus revealed what was troubling Him. Here we see the principle, set up by the Lord&#8217;s example, that foot-washing sifts the false one.<h2 class=head2>To Expose the Self-confident One</h2><p>We have indicated that foot-washing also exposes the self-confident one. Foot-washing will expose whether we are proud or humble, whether we are self-confident or trust in the Lord. Peter was exposed by foot-washing. Although he was genuine, he was also very self-confident. Therefore, at the time of foot-washing the Lord said to him, &#8220;Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a cock shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times&#8221; (v. 38). The Lord loved Peter to the uttermost, but Peter denied the Lord to the uttermost. Before Peter denied Him, he was self-confident, and this self-confidence was exposed by foot-washing.<p>I am glad that in the church life we do not practice literal foot-washing as a legality. But we do have spiritual foot-washing in order to eliminate all defects so that we may have clear fellowship with one another and with God. Through the practice of foot-washing, everything becomes genuine, frank, pure, clean, and clear. No dirt is concealed, and no falsehood or self-confidence remains.<p>If we practice foot-washing in the church life, no false one will remain. Moreover, the strong, self-confident ones will be subdued. If someone had asked Peter about his denying the Lord, he may have said, &#8220;I was full of self-confidence. But the Lord had a way to bring me down. The Lord washed my feet, and I was exposed. But I still need your foot-washing, and I am willing to receive it.&#8221; This is needed in the church life.<p>Apparently the record of foot-washing in John 13 is not important. Actually, it is crucial in a very practical way. If there is no foot-washing, we cannot have the church life. From over fifty years&#8217; experience in the church life, I realize that all the churches on earth need the practice of foot-washing. In order to maintain clear fellowship with one another and with the Lord, we need the reality of foot-washing.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>AN OVERVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h2 class=head1>A RECORD OF SIGNS</h2><p>In this message we shall see an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John. This Gospel is a record of signs. Every chapter in this book contains certain signs. These signs may be simple, but they are very rich in their implications. For example, a street sign may have a simple appearance, but what it indicates may nevertheless be very important.<p>When John wrote his Gospel he followed the principle of writing down certain signs. In 20:30 and 31 John said, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221; The very last verse of the Gospel of John says, &#8220;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written&#8221; (21:25). This verse, together with 20:30-31, affirms that this Gospel is the record of a selection of things that serve a particular purpose.<p>It is impossible to exhaust in writing the things done by the Lord Jesus. Knowing this, John selected certain of the Lord&#8217;s doings and arranged them in a record that is significant not only historically but also doctrinally. For instance, John placed the record of foot-washing in chapter thirteen, not in chapter eleven.<p>We have pointed out that the sequence of events in the Gospel of John is for the formation of a doctrinal frame. Chapter one is a prologue to the entire Gospel, and in chapter two we have the principle of life and the goal of life. Then in chapters three through eleven we have nine cases. The issue, the outcome, of these nine cases is the miniature of the church life seen in Bethany. In Bethany there was the feasting on the peace offering.<p>The church life portrayed by the feasting in Bethany was marvelous, but it was too limited. It was excellent in quality, but it was much too small in quantity. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to die in order for this kind of church life to be multiplied. For this reason, the Lord was not willing to receive the exaltation of the crowd, but instead told His disciples that He was a grain of wheat to fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains (12:24). As the unique grain, the Lord is the source of the church life. But it was necessary for this grain to be multiplied into many grains. Because the Lord fell into the ground and died, many have been drawn to Him. This was the reason He said, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself (12:32). John 12 reveals that the Lord Jesus was ready to die in order to bring His people into God.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF THE LAVER</h2><p>In chapter thirteen we have the record of foot-washing. In 13:10 the Lord Jesus said to Peter, &#8220;He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean.&#8221; God&#8217;s redeemed, saved, and regenerated people have all been &#8220;bathed,&#8221; or cleansed. Nevertheless, they are still on earth and by contact with the earth are defiled again and again. Hence, there is the need of the laver. If there were no laver, the earthly contact would annul the wonderful result of Christ being all the offerings. Therefore, there is the need of washing to preserve, to maintain, the result of Christ being the offerings to us.<p>We may use cooking and serving food as an illustration. A sister may prepare an excellent meal for her family. However, if she is careless, something may come in to defile the food that has been prepared. Knowing this, the sister will do what is necessary to preserve the food she has prepared. The washing in the laver preserves what has been accomplished by Christ being the offerings. Earthly contact may not be sinful, but it defiles the result of Christ&#8217;s wonderful work. Because of the need to preserve this result, there is the need of the laver. According to the arrangement in the Old Testament, the laver stood between the altar and the tabernacle.<p>If we study the Gospel of John with a spiritual view, we shall realize that chapters one through twelve show us all the offerings. We may say that these chapters reveal different aspects of the all-inclusive Christ, and that these aspects are related to the offerings. Therefore, in these chapters the offerings are fulfilled. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; and 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Both of these verses point to Christ as the offerings.<p>In chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the tabernacle. Chapter thirteen is a turning point, a link between chapters one through twelve and chapters fourteen through seventeen. Chapters one through twelve are at the altar, and chapters fourteen through seventeen are in the tabernacle. Between these sections we have chapter thirteen as a connection and turning point. In this chapter we have the laver, which is located between the altar and the tabernacle.<p>Comparatively speaking, the laver is not as important as the altar or the tabernacle. The laver can be compared to a small part in a large machine. Although the machine is large and the part is small, the machine cannot function properly without it. The principle is the same with the laver in relation to the altar and the tabernacle.<p>The offerings are on the altar, and in the tabernacle are many riches: the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Although the laver contains only water, it should not be neglected. If we neglect the laver, we shall not be able to enter into the tabernacle, for what was accomplished at the altar would be annulled because of defilement. If we are defiled through earthly contact, we shall not be allowed to enter into the dwelling place of the clean and holy God. Whoever comes into the tabernacle must be clean in every way-physically, psychologically, spiritually, and morally. Those who enter the tabernacle must be clean in spirit, soul, and body. Only when we are thoroughly clean are we qualified to enter the Holy Place, the sanctuary. If we see this, we shall realize that foot-washing is crucial.<p>Among certain Christians today, even the altar has been polluted because there is no laver. According to what we have pointed out concerning the laver in previous messages, the laver is altogether lacking. Because there is no laver and the altar has been polluted, there is absolutely nothing of the tabernacle. This is today&#8217;s situation. We thank the Lord that, in His recovery, we have the Holy Place, at least to some extent. We enjoy the church life portrayed by the miniature in Bethany. This means that in the church life we are feasting with the Lord, with the incarnated God.<h2 class=head1>THE TEN SIGNS IN CHAPTERS FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h2><h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Father&#8217;s House</h2><p>Let us now go on to have an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen. The first sign in these chapters is the sign of the Father&#8217;s house. Many Christians think that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion. This concept, however, is far off.<p>When we come to chapter fourteen, we shall consider the revelation concerning God&#8217;s dwelling place from the beginning in Genesis to the consummation in Revelation. We shall cover a number of items, the first of which will be Jacob&#8217;s dream at Bethel (Gen. 28). Bethel means the house of God. In previous messages on Bethel we pointed out that Bethel is the gate of heaven, and that at Bethel heaven is brought down to earth, and earth is joined to heaven. In Genesis 28:17 Jacob declared, &#8220;This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&#8221; Furthermore, we are told in verse 12 that the ladder Jacob saw in his dream was &#8220;set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven.&#8221; The vital point, however, is that the Lord stood above the ladder (v. 13). This indicates that the ladder actually reached not to heaven but to God. This ladder brings God to earth and joins earth to God.<p>In Genesis Jacob saw Bethel, but in Exodus Jacob&#8217;s descendants built the tabernacle. We need to realize that the tabernacle actually was Bethel, the house of God, God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth. Moreover, the tabernacle was the gate of heaven. When the tabernacle was erected, the glory of God descended upon it, filled it, and overshadowed it.<p>Eventually, the tabernacle in Exodus became the temple. Here we see the progress from Bethel to the tabernacle and from the tabernacle to the temple. We may say that the Old Testament is a history of the tabernacle and the temple.<p>In the Old Testament God&#8217;s people enjoyed the house of God. According to Psalm 132, it was the place of God&#8217;s rest, the place that satisfied His desire. It was also a place of rich provision for God&#8217;s people.<p>If you know the Old Testament, you will realize that the enjoyment of God&#8217;s redeemed people was the temple. They longed, yearned, to dwell in the temple. The psalmist says that to dwell one day in the temple is better than dwelling a thousand days elsewhere (84:10). How God&#8217;s people appreciated His house! According to Psalm 27:4, it was there they could behold the beauty of the Lord. Psalm 36:8 indicates that they were bountifully, abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God&#8217;s house. There in His house they drank of the river of God&#8217;s pleasures. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;pleasures&#8221; is the plural of the word for Eden. This means that God&#8217;s people drank the river of Eden, the river of paradise. God&#8217;s people also longed to be planted in the house of God. They knew that they would grow in the house of God as a green olive tree full of sap and that even in old age they would continue to bear fruit (52:8; 92:13-14). All these verses in the Psalms indicate the enjoyment of the Old Testament saints in the house of God.<p>Apart from God&#8217;s dwelling place, the temple, the Old Testament saints did not have any enjoyment. The record in the Old Testament does not speak of entertainment or amusement enjoyed by God&#8217;s people. Rather, the Bible tells us only of the feasts at Mount Zion around the house of God. This was their real enjoyment. Their holy days, their holidays, were the feasts, and their weekend was the Sabbath, a day on which they enjoyed resting with God. Their enjoyment was altogether related to the house of God. This is a brief description of the Father&#8217;s house in the Old Testament.<p>In forthcoming messages we shall also consider the Father&#8217;s house in the New Testament. The first aspect of the Father&#8217;s house in the New Testament is Christ incarnated to be the tabernacle (John 1:14). The incarnated Christ was the Father&#8217;s house, the tabernacle. Through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection, this tabernacle was enlarged and became the church, the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). Eventually, the church as God&#8217;s dwelling place will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, there are six matters related to the great sign of the Father&#8217;s house: Bethel, the tabernacle, the temple, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Son&#8217;s Going and Coming</h2><p>The second sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen is the sign of the Son&#8217;s going and coming. The Son&#8217;s going signifies a great deal, and His coming signifies even more. According to chapter fourteen, the Son&#8217;s going was to die an all-inclusive death to solve the problem of sin, to condemn the world, to destroy Satan, to release the divine life, and to draw all men unto Himself. What a great sign! The Son&#8217;s coming is His resurrection to germinate us in order to have a new creation to produce the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. The sign of the Son&#8217;s coming and going is great. However, many believers understand the Son&#8217;s going to be His going to heaven and His coming to be His second advent.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Way, the Reality, and the Life</h2><p>The third sign is the sign of the way, the reality, and the life (14:6). As we shall see, the way is the incarnated God with all that He is and all that He has done. Following the way, we have the reality, which also is the Triune God. Whatever the Triune God has accomplished is the reality, and this reality is the way. What is the life? The life is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. In other words, life is the Triune God. We share this life in the Son, the life brings in the reality, and the reality is the way.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>The fourth sign is the great sign of the divine Trinity, the sign of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. In these chapters there are many matters related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, and this entire God is Spirit. We should not say that only God the Spirit is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not. No, the entire Triune God is Spirit. It is foolish to say that Jesus Christ and the Father are not Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of Another Paraclete</h2><p>The fifth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel is the sign of another Paraclete. Paraclete is an anglicized form of the Greek word parakletos. These chapters reveal that the Triune God has become a Paraclete, Helper, Advocate, Counsel. We may say that He is our divine Attorney.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Abode</h2><p>Another sign in these chapters is the sign of the abode. In 14:2 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; In 14:23 He goes on to say, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; As we shall see, the abode in John 14 has nothing to do with a so-called heavenly mansion. This word &#8220;abode&#8221; is a great sign.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the True Vine</h2><p>The seventh sign we shall consider is that of the true vine. This true vine is the universal organism of the Triune God; it is not an organization. The Son is the vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the Spirit is the testifier. All this is revealed in chapter fifteen. In this chapter we have the Father as the husbandman, the Son as the vine, and the Spirit as the One who testifies concerning the Son. This vine is the organism of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Newborn Child</h2><p>You may be surprised to learn what the eighth sign is in these chapters. The eighth sign is the sign of a newborn child. In 16:20 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.&#8221; The Lord went on to liken the disciples&#8217; sorrow to that of a woman giving birth to a child (v. 21). Then the Lord continued, &#8220;You therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you&#8221; (v. 22). Here we see that the disciples are a &#8220;woman&#8221; travailing to give birth to a &#8220;child.&#8221; This child is the firstborn Son of God.<p>In resurrection Jesus Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God. Before incarnation He was God&#8217;s only begotten Son, and He continued to be the only begotten Son until His resurrection. But in resurrection He was born as the first begotten Son of God. This was the newborn child in John 16, and in this child we all are included. As we shall see, eventually this newborn child is a corporate man, a new man. What a great sign this is!<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Divine Glorification</h2><p>The ninth sign, seen in chapter seventeen, is the sign of the divine glorification. In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; Not many Christians have a full understanding of what this means. This is a matter of divine glorification, a matter that involves us. This is proved by the fact that the very glory the Lord Jesus shares with the Father has been given to us so that in this glory we may be one: &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one&#8221; (17:22).<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Believers&#8217; Oneness in the Triune God</h2><p>The last sign in John 14 through 17 is the sign of the believer&#8217;s oneness in the Triune God. According to John 17, the believers need to be preserved in oneness in the name of the Father, by the word of God, and by the glory of God. Eventually, we all shall be perfectly one in the Triune God. This oneness is the Father&#8217;s house. By this we see that these four chapters begin with the Father&#8217;s house and end with the oneness of the believers in the Triune God, and that such a oneness is actually the house of the Father. This is an overview of the signs in John 14 through 17.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</h1><p>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John are a message given by the Lord Jesus during His last night on earth. Knowing that He would be put to death the next day, during the evening He gave this message to His disciples. The message in these chapters may be considered the deepest revelation in the New Testament. After giving this message, the Lord Jesus offered the prayer to the Father recorded in chapter seventeen. Hence, chapter seventeen may be considered the concluding prayer of the message in chapters fourteen through sixteen. Later we shall see the content of this message.<p>I would remind you that the title of this series of messages is &#8220;The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John.&#8221; Many Christians do not realize that the writings of John, especially his Gospel, are the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament. Some may find this difficult to understand. After much deep study, we have come to realize the fact that the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament are fulfilled in the writings of John.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>We need to see the significance of the tabernacle and all the offerings. The tabernacle is God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth among His people. This is a great matter. The tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place among His people on earth is actually the center and reality of the entire universe. We may say that the universe, which is composed of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, is a huge container. What does the universe contain? Of course, the universe contains God. However, God wants His redeemed people to be His dwelling place in the universe. The universe contains God&#8217;s people, and God&#8217;s people are His dwelling place. Therefore, God&#8217;s dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe.<p>Suppose in this universe there was no such thing as a collective people; that is, there was no such thing as those who are God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. If this were the situation, there would be no dwelling place of God in the universe. Without God&#8217;s people as His dwelling place, the universe would be empty and vain, without a center and without reality. Therefore, we need to see that the center and reality of the universe is God&#8217;s dwelling place among His people.<h2 class=head1>A MUTUAL ABODE</h2><p>The tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place is actually a mutual dwelling place, a mutual abode. This abode is God&#8217;s dwelling and also the dwelling of God&#8217;s serving ones. Eventually, God dwells in His people, and His people dwell in Him. This means there is a mutual dwelling in a mutual dwelling place. Such a wonderful dwelling place is the center and reality of the entire universe.<p>This wonderful dwelling place is not only the center and reality of the universe; it is also the center and reality of the Bible. What is the center and reality of the Old Testament? It is the tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place. What is the center and reality of the New Testament? It is God&#8217;s house, God&#8217;s habitation. The whole Bible is a history of God&#8217;s dwelling place. This matter is crucial.<p>Another crucial matter concerns what is revealed in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into His people and thereby making them His dwelling place. Eventually, God&#8217;s dwelling place also becomes the dwelling place of God&#8217;s people. Hence, it is a mutual dwelling place or mutual abode. John 15:4 says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; This can also be translated, &#8220;Dwell in Me and I in you.&#8221; In this verse we see the mutual dwelling. Since there is a mutual dwelling, there must certainly be a mutual abode. This mutual abode is the center and reality of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>AN ABSTRACT OF THE BIBLE AND ITS EXTRACTS</h2><p>The Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible. Whereas the Gospel of John is an abstract of the Bible, the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is an extract of this Gospel. Because the Bible is so long, we need an abstract of it in order to see a sketch of the whole. Then we need an extract of this abstract to see its essence. In these messages our concern is with the extract of each chapter.<p>As we have previously pointed out, an extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is &#8220;spirit,&#8221; which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance. The extracts of certain substances are sometimes used as medicine. We may say that the twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John are a certain substance, and in these messages we are concerned with the extract of this substance. Likewise, this extract may cheer us, or, like medicine, it may heal us.<p>We have pointed out that the content and reality of the universe is God&#8217;s people as His dwelling place. The universe may be compared to a shell, and God&#8217;s people as His dwelling place, to the content of this shell. Today God is building His people together to become His dwelling place. This dwelling place is the tabernacle. According to the picture in the Old Testament, God&#8217;s serving ones, the priests, dwelt in the tabernacle; that is, they dwelt in God&#8217;s dwelling place. Hence, the tabernacle is a mutual dwelling place, a dwelling place for both God and man. This dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe and also the center and reality of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB OF GOD</h2><p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible. In this book we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. We have the tabernacle in the first chapter of John: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (1:1, 14). This is a literal translation of the Greek. However, some versions are not literal in rendering verse 14 and use the word &#8220;dwelt&#8221; instead of &#8220;tabernacled.&#8221; But writing this Gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, John selected the word &#8220;tabernacled&#8221; to indicate that Jesus, the very God incarnate, was a tabernacle. While the Lord Jesus was in the flesh dwelling among men, He was tabernacling among them. Therefore, John 1:14 indicates that Christ is the real tabernacle. First, He was God&#8217;s dwelling place, and now He has also become our dwelling place. This means that He is the mutual dwelling place of God and of God&#8217;s chosen people.<p>In the Old Testament we have the type of the tabernacle. But in the Gospel of John we have the fulfillment of the type. The type of the tabernacle in Exodus was a shadow or model; it was not the real tabernacle. The real tabernacle, the fulfillment of the type, is in the Gospel of John. God incarnate is this real tabernacle. As God in the flesh, Jesus is the real tabernacle in which God dwells and in which we also may dwell. By this we see that the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle is in the Gospel of John.<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have not only the tabernacle but also the Lamb of God: &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (v. 29). What is the Lamb of God? Here in John 1 the Lamb of God is the aggregate of all the offerings, the totality of the offerings. In typology the offerings were a number of categories: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering and the peace offering. In addition, there were the wave offering, the heave offering, the freewill offerings, and also the drink offering. But the basic offerings are the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. All these offerings are represented in John 1 by the Lamb of God. Therefore, in chapter one of John we have the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings.<p>To say that in John 1 we have the tabernacle and the offerings means that in this chapter we have the tabernacle and the altar that is in front of the tabernacle. Of course, the word &#8220;altar&#8221; cannot be found in this chapter. Nevertheless, here we have the fact of the altar. Verse 29 tells us to behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Where did the Lamb of God take away our sin? He did this on the cross, and the cross is the altar. Hence, in John 1 we have the tabernacle and the cross, the altar.<p>The altar is for the entry into the tabernacle. Apart from the offerings, we do not have a way to enter into the tabernacle. The Lamb of God is the way for us to enter into the real tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>Not many Christians have seen that the tabernacle and the offerings are fulfilled in the Gospel of John. However, in the last century certain of the Brethren teachers saw this. Approximately sixty years ago, when I was under the teaching of the Brethren, I was told that in the Gospel of John we can find the tabernacle and all the offerings. The Brethren teaching, however, did not place much emphasis on the Spirit and life. Their teaching presented the picture of the tabernacle and the altar in John as the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament, but it did not reveal the Spirit and life in this picture.<p>Two crucial matters in the Gospel of John are life and the Spirit. John is a book on eternal life, and eternal life is related to the Spirit. Without eternal life and the Spirit, we can have only a picture of the tabernacle and the offerings, but not the reality and practicality of the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Recently we gave a series of messages entitled &#8220;The Central View of the Divine Dispensation.&#8221; Those messages were concerned with God&#8217;s dispensing. God&#8217;s dispensing is altogether a matter of eternal life and the Spirit. Furthermore, this dispensing is for the purpose of fulfilling the tabernacle and all the offerings. When we have the adequate dispensing of God into us as life, we eventually become the tabernacle; and when we become the tabernacle, we enjoy Christ in a practical way as all the offerings. Thus we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THE OFFERINGS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>Perhaps you are wondering where in the Gospel of John we can find the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. We have the sin offering in chapter three, a chapter that describes the case of Nicodemus. Verse 14 says, &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; This verse speaks of Christ as the sin offering to deal with indwelling sin, that is, to deal with our serpentine nature.<p>In chapter four, which describes the case of an immoral Samaritan woman, we have the trespass offering. Nicodemus&#8217; problem was the serpentine nature, but the Samaritan woman&#8217;s problem was her trespasses, for she had had five husbands and was living with someone who was not her husband. She needed Christ as her trespass offering.<p>In chapter seven we see that Christ is absolute for God&#8217;s glory and also absolute to do God&#8217;s will. This is Christ as the burnt offering for God&#8217;s satisfaction.<p>We find the meal offering in chapter six, a chapter that speaks of the bread of life. Here the bread of life is the meal offering.<p>Finally, in chapter twelve we see Christ as the peace offering. In a house in Bethany the Lord Jesus and some of the believers were feasting. Together they were enjoying the peace offering. Therefore, in chapters three, four, seven, six, and twelve we see Christ as the fulfillment of the five basic offerings in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head1>A FULL PICTURE OF THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>Along with the altar and all the offerings, we need the laver. As we have pointed out, the laver is a place for washing. Chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John gives us the laver for foot-washing.<p>After the laver, we have the tabernacle. The laver is in chapter thirteen, and the tabernacle is in chapters fourteen through sixteen. In these chapters we have the tabernacle with the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Then in chapter seventeen we have the incense altar, for in this chapter we have Christ&#8217;s intercessory prayer. If we put all these matters together, we shall see that in the Gospel of John we have a full picture of the tabernacle.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</h1><p>The writings of John are books of signs. In John 14 through 17 there are ten great signs. Some of the signs in the earlier chapters of this Gospel are the tabernacle (1:14), the Lamb of God (1:29), the door (10:7), and the pasture (10:9). A sign is a symbol with spiritual significance. A traffic signal is a good illustration. In a traffic signal, each color has a specific meaning: red means stop, and green means go. Both in the Gospel of John and in the book of Revelation there are many signs.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER&#8217;S HOUSE</h2><p>The first of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John is the sign of the Father&#8217;s house. We need to study the Gospel of John in order to see that the Father&#8217;s house signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to be a dwelling place for both God and His people.<p>Throughout the centuries many have held the concept that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion, a mansion in the heavens to which the believers go after they die. It is common for pastors at the funeral of a believer to comfort the relatives by saying that the one who has died has now gone to a heavenly mansion, and that in this heavenly mansion he is happy. The pastor may go on to say that all believers will go to this mansion when they die.<p>Many believers think that there are three main reasons for becoming a Christian: first, to receive forgiveness of sins; second, to be saved from eternal perdition; and third, to go to a heavenly mansion when we die. This is the general thought held by many Christians. However, the concept of going to a heavenly mansion is superstitious and completely off the line of the revelation in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John is not concerned with a heavenly mansion. The revelation in this Gospel concerns the Triune God dispensing Himself into us that He may make us His dwelling place and that this dwelling place may also become our dwelling place. This is the subject of John&#8217;s Gospel. In this book there is no thought about going to heaven.<p>The Gospel of John opens like this: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221; (1:1). Then we are told that &#8220;the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality&#8221; (v. 14). John goes on to say in 1:16, &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; What is the purpose of the Word&#8217;s becoming flesh, full of grace and reality? Is the purpose that we might go to heaven? This thought is illogical and far off the mark.<p>In the Gospel of John the Father&#8217;s house does not signify a heavenly mansion. The Father&#8217;s house signifies God mingling Himself with His redeemed people to make them His house, His dwelling place. Eventually, God&#8217;s dwelling place will also become the dwelling place of His redeemed people. Praise the Lord that in the universe there is such a wonderful entity as this mutual dwelling place for God and His redeemed people! God is dispensing Himself into His people and mingling Himself with them in order to produce such a mutual dwelling place.<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have the tabernacle, and in chapter two we have the temple. Concerning the temple, the Lord Jesus said that it was His Father&#8217;s house: &#8220;Do not make My Father&#8217;s house a house of merchandise&#8221; (v. 16). By this we can see that the Father&#8217;s house in chapter two refers to the temple. That temple was on earth; it was not a mansion in the heavens. The same term that was used to refer to the temple on earth in 2:16 is used again in 14:2: &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; It is not logical to say that the Father&#8217;s house in chapter two is the temple on earth and that the Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen is a heavenly mansion.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that in the Gospel of John the expression &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; is used twice. In 2:16 it clearly refers to the temple on earth. What, then, does it refer to in 14:2? Here it also refers to God&#8217;s house among His people on earth; it does not refer to a heavenly mansion.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BUILT UP IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>If the Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen refers to a mansion in the heavens that the Lord has gone to build, then God has two buildings going on in the universe at the same time. These two buildings would be the church and the mansion in the heavens. In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus said clearly that He is building His church. If the house in John 14 is a heavenly mansion, then in addition to the church on earth, the Lord Jesus is building a house in the heavens. This would mean that He is building two houses, one in the heavens and the other on earth.<p>If the house in John 14 is a heavenly mansion, there would be no need for the Lord Jesus to build it. He could simply have created it. In creation, whenever God wanted something, He simply spoke, and that thing came into being. For instance, God needed the earth. Therefore, He spoke, and the earth came into being. The principle would be the same with a so-called heavenly mansion. If God needed a heavenly mansion as a dwelling place, there would be no need for Him to spend two thousand years to build it. Since such a dwelling place would be part of His creation, He would only need to speak, and His dwelling place would be produced.<p>When the Lord speaks of the Father&#8217;s house in John 14, He is not referring to a heavenly mansion. The house in this chapter is the church. The church is God&#8217;s house, the Father&#8217;s house. The Lord Jesus spoke these words shortly before His death. Then through His death and resurrection, He built the church. This concept fits the entire thought of the Gospel of John.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, working Himself into us, by way of the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection. The Lord Jesus indicated this in chapter two when He said to the Jewish leaders, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (2:19). The phrase &#8220;in three days&#8221; means in resurrection. Thus, here the Lord is saying that He would build up the temple, the Father&#8217;s house, in resurrection. The Lord seemed to be telling the religious leaders, &#8220;You destroy this temple, My Father&#8217;s house, and I will build it up in resurrection.&#8221; By this we can see that chapters two and fourteen of the Gospel of John correspond to each other.<p>In 14:2 the Lord said that He was going to prepare a place for us in the Father&#8217;s house. His going to prepare a place was His going by His death and resurrection. Apart from the death and resurrection of Christ, there is neither a way for us to enter into God nor a place for us in God. The Lord Jesus had to die in order to cut the way, prepare a way, for us to have a standing, a place, in God.<h2 class=head1>MANY ABODES</h2><p>In 14:2 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; An abode is a dwelling place. Therefore, the many abodes in verse 2 are many dwelling places. In verse 23 the Lord says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; In verses 2 and 23 the same Greek word is used for &#8220;abode.&#8221; The only difference is that in verse 2 this word is plural, and in verse 23 it is singular. Together, these two verses indicate that the many abodes of the Father&#8217;s house are the many believers. The Father&#8217;s house is actually the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is composed of believers as members. Every member of Christ&#8217;s Body is an abode of the Father&#8217;s house.<p>Do you think that God does not have a complete dwelling place in the heavens and that it is necessary for the Lord Jesus to finish building Him one there? Do you believe that while the Lord is building the church on earth, He is also building a heavenly mansion for the Father? God&#8217;s creation was completed long ago. This means that the heavens also were completed and that there is no need for additional building in the heavens. However, it is still necessary for the church, God&#8217;s chosen people, to be built up. The Lord Jesus died for them and was raised up with them. Now based on His death and resurrection, He is working on them to build them up into one Body, and this Body is the church, the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). Every member of the church is an abode for God to dwell in. When God abides in us, He becomes our dwelling place. How wonderful! Praise the Lord that we all are God&#8217;s abodes! We all are members of the Body of Christ, and this Body is God&#8217;s house.<p>In the New Testament we have the concept that our body is our tabernacle. Chapter five of 2 Corinthians indicates that our body is our dwelling place. In a similar way, Christ&#8217;s Body is God&#8217;s dwelling place. This means that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 is Christ&#8217;s Body built up with the believers. Every believer in Christ is an abode of this house for God to dwell in.<p>The Father&#8217;s house is a mutual abode, an abode for both God and us. But if we would not be built up through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection so that God can dwell in us, we shall be short of the experience of God as our dwelling place. We need to be built up through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection so that God can dwell in us. When we are built up in this way, we become an abode to God. When God dwells in us, He becomes our dwelling place. This is our abode. Furthermore, this means that we and God, God and we, are mingled together to become one abode, a mutual abode. God abides in us, and we abide in God-a mutual abiding. This is the thought of the Gospel of John. Therefore, the Father&#8217;s house is a sign signifying the mingling of God with His people.<h2 class=head1>BETHEL</h2><p>In the Old Testament we have Bethel (Gen. 28:12-13a, 16-19a, 22a). What is the emphasis with Bethel? Bethel means the house of God. According to Genesis 28, at Bethel we see the stone with oil poured upon it. In this chapter Jacob poured oil upon the stone and called it Bethel. This indicates that Bethel, the house of God, is composed of stone and oil. Stone signifies God&#8217;s transformed people (John 1:42; Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5), and the oil signifies God as the Spirit reaching His people. Here we see the mingling of God with His people.<p>With Bethel we also have the gate of heaven with the ladder set up on earth and reaching heaven (John 1:51). This ladder brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. We experience this ladder in the church life. The church life is the gate of heaven, and in the church life we have the sense that heaven is brought down to earth and earth is joined to heaven. This is Bethel.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>In Exodus 25 we have the tabernacle, a holy place for God&#8217;s dwelling (Exo. 25:8-9). The tabernacle was built of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15, 29). Since acacia wood signifies proper humanity and gold signifies divinity, here we have humanity mingled with divinity.<p>Furthermore, the tabernacle was held by and covered with Christ&#8217;s redemption (Exo. 38:27; 26:14). The tabernacle rested on one hundred silver sockets. Each socket was a talent of silver weighing over a hundred pounds. These hundred sockets were the foundation of the tabernacle. By this we see that the tabernacle was actually held by these sockets. Silver signifies the redemption of Christ. Hence, the tabernacle was held by Christ&#8217;s redemption. Moreover, the tabernacle was also covered with the redemption of Christ, as signified by the rams&#8217; skins dyed red.<p>With the tabernacle we also have Christ as the offerings for God&#8217;s redeemed to enter in and the riches of Christ for the ones who have entered in to enjoy within the tabernacle. Through Christ as the offerings, God&#8217;s redeemed people can enter the tabernacle. Then once inside the tabernacle they can enjoy the riches of Christ signified by the showbread table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar.<h2 class=head1>THE TEMPLE</h2><p>In the Old Testament the temple was the house of God (1 Kings 6:1). As God&#8217;s house, the temple was the tabernacle enlarged (1 Kings 6:2, 20; see Exo. 26:15-16, 18, 20, 22). The temple was founded upon a foundation of stone (1 Kings 6:37), and it was built of stone, cedar, and fir overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6:7, 9, 15-16, 18, 20-22). Stone signifies transformed humanity; cedar, humanity in resurrection; and fir, humanity through death. As we have seen with the tabernacle, gold signifies divinity. Therefore, with the temple we once again see the mingling of divinity with humanity through death and in resurrection and transformation.<p>The temple was God&#8217;s rest. It satisfied His desire forever. It also was a place of rich provision for His people (Psa. 132:13-16).<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS&#8217; ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>In addition to being God&#8217;s rest, the temple was also the saints&#8217; enjoyment. This enjoyment is portrayed in the Psalms. The saints enjoyed God&#8217;s riches in the temple. This indicates that the house of God was not only God&#8217;s dwelling place, but was also the dwelling place of the saints. The saints longed and yearned to dwell in it (Psa. 84:1-2, 4, 10; 43:3; 122:1; 23:6). In the temple they found a home for themselves and also a nest for their young (Psa. 84:3). This indicates that in the church life we find a home for ourselves and also a nest for the young ones we bring in. Furthermore, in the temple the saints enjoyed the Lord as the sun and shield with grace and glory (Psa. 84:11). In the temple they beheld the beauty of the Lord and inquired in it (Psa. 27:4). They were also satisfied abundantly with the riches of God&#8217;s house, drinking of the river of God&#8217;s pleasures, enjoying the fountain of life, and receiving the divine light (Psa. 36:8-9). This is a picture of the divine riches we enjoy in the church life, the house of God.<p>In the temple the saints grow like a green olive tree, full of sap and fruit (Psa. 52:8; 92:13-14). In the temple they also receive God&#8217;s revelation concerning the destiny of the ungodly and the godly under His dealing (Psa. 73:13-25). This indicates that in the church life we receive God&#8217;s revelation concerning situations that we are not able to understand. If you enter into the church life, you will see God&#8217;s revelation concerning the godly and the ungodly.<h2 class=head1>NOT A HEAVENLY MANSION</h2><p>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion. To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John can be compared to adding a foreign element to our physical body. Every part of our body is organic, but a foreign element added to it will not be an organic part of the Body. To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John is to inject into it something that is not of life. This is basically against John&#8217;s principle.<p>As we have indicated, if the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion, this means that today the Lord Jesus is carrying on two kinds of building work. According to Matthew 16, the Lord is building the church. Do you think that, on the one hand, the Lord is building the church on earth and that, on the other hand, He is building a mansion in the heavens? This thought is not logical, and it is also against the divine principle.<p>The Bible clearly reveals that God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation. In God&#8217;s old creation, God did everything by speaking. He simply had to speak, and item after item came into being. If God had needed a heavenly mansion, it would already have been created. It is not correct to say that after God&#8217;s creation it was necessary for Him to add something to His creation or to remodel it.<p>God&#8217;s second creation, the new creation, does not take place by His speaking. Rather, the new creation is accomplished by Christ&#8217;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. In this way He works Himself into God&#8217;s chosen people. By such a process He makes His creation divine.<p>The old creation was not divine. Although it was created by God, it did not have anything of God&#8217;s nature in it. The new creation is different, for it is an entity saturated with God&#8217;s being. God works Himself into this entity not through speaking it into being, but through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. We may also add transformation and glorification. This is the building of God in this universe. This is not the building of a heavenly mansion in a material sense. On the contrary, it is the building up of the Body of Christ organically, and this Body is the Father&#8217;s house.<p>Like the vine in John 15, the Father&#8217;s house is an organism, not an organization. Also, the Father&#8217;s house is the oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17. In this chapter the Lord prayed that the Father would make all the believers one in the Triune God. Hence, in chapter seventeen we have the oneness of the believers in the Triune God. This is the mingling of the Triune God with His people, and this oneness is organic. It is a divine organism, an organism that is Christ&#8217;s Body, the Father&#8217;s house, and also a mutual dwelling place. In this age this dwelling place is the church life, and in eternity it will be the New Jerusalem. This is the proper understanding of John 14:2.<p>According to Kittel&#8217;s Theological Word Book of the New Testament, it was the Gnostics who used the Greek word for house (oikia) to refer to a heavenly mansion. By this we see that the thought of a heavenly mansion is pagan. This thought is also heretical.<p>Because of the Gnostic concept of a heavenly mansion, some expositors have thought that John was under Gnostic influence when he wrote his Gospel. According to these expositors, in chapter fourteen John was following the Gnostics to speak of a heavenly mansion. However, John certainly was not a Gnostic, and he did not use the word oikia to denote a heavenly mansion. He did not use this word with a Gnostic denotation. Actually, it was not John who used this word as recorded in the Gospel of John; it was the Lord Jesus who spoke of the Father&#8217;s house, and He surely was not a Gnostic. Neither did the Lord use any other word with a Gnostic denotation.<p>The word of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John concerning the Father&#8217;s house does not refer to a mansion in the heavens; it refers to Christ&#8217;s mystical Body, that is, to a divine organism composed of the Triune God mingled with His chosen people. To say that John 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion is to take in a concept that is Gnostic, pagan, heathen, and heretical. We surely must utterly abandon such a concept. This thought is leaven brought in from a pagan source.<p>Although the truth has been leavened, I believe that the Lord Jesus will recover the pure truth. As part of this recovery, we must purge out the leaven of a heavenly mansion. The thought of going to a heavenly mansion after we die is superstitious, superficial, and false. It is also deceitful, for believers are cheated when they are told that their departed loved ones are now in a heavenly mansion. This leaven must be altogether cleared away.<p>I encourage you to pray over these matters and to have fellowship concerning them. Then we shall see that, truthfully speaking, there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is not building a heavenly mansion. On the contrary, by the Spirit and through His death and resurrection, He is building an organism, the church, which is His Body and the Father&#8217;s house. This house is composed of the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people. May we all be nourished with the truth concerning the mingling of God with us to produce a mutual dwelling place.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</h1><p>In the previous message we covered three illustrations related to the Father&#8217;s house: Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple. In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus refers to Bethel: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&#8221; This verse indicates that Christ as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven, joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel (Gen. 28:11-12). It was at Bethel that Jacob poured oil upon the stone so that it might be the house of God. In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have not only the ladder in verse 51, but also the stone in verse 42: &#8220;Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).&#8221; Furthermore, in John 1 there is a strong emphasis on the Spirit, signified by the dove (v. 32), and also on the Lamb (vv. 29, 36). The Lamb produces the stone, and the Spirit is the oil poured upon the stone. The result is Bethel. Therefore, in John 1 we can see Bethel, the house of God. Furthermore, in John 1:14 we have the tabernacle, and in 2:14-16, the temple. Therefore, Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple in the Old Testament are all fulfilled in the Gospel of John.<p>In this message we shall consider three other illustrations of the Father&#8217;s house, all of which are found in the New Testament: the incarnated Word as the tabernacle (John 1:14), the resurrected temple (John 2:19-21), and the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2-3).<h2 class=head1>THE REAL TABERNACLE</h2><p>In John 1:14 we see that the incarnated Word, God in the flesh, is the real tabernacle: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; This tabernacle is God&#8217;s dwelling place and expression. A particular dwelling place is always the expression of the person who dwells there. For example, the home of a German person will have a German expression. Just as our home is our expression, so God&#8217;s dwelling place is His expression.<p>The real tabernacle, God incarnate, is God&#8217;s dwelling place and also our dwelling place. In John 1 God incarnate, the incarnated Word as God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth and His expression, had purposed for His chosen people to enter into Him. In chapter one the real tabernacle was present, expressing God and containing God.<p>Jesus was God incarnate, God in the flesh. He was the real tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place and expression. As such a tabernacle, He was eager for the disciples to enter into Him. But the disciples were not ready, and there was no way for them to enter into the Lord as the tabernacle. According to the picture in the Old Testament, the way to enter into the tabernacle was through the offerings. Unless someone offered something to God on the altar for his sins, an Israelite could not have an entrance into God&#8217;s tabernacle. Likewise, our sin and sins are great obstacles standing between us and the door of the tabernacle. Because of these obstacles, we do not have a way to enter into the tabernacle. Therefore, we need Christ as our unique offering. It was necessary for Him to die on the cross for us and for our sins in order to cut the way and to make an entrance for us to come into the tabernacle.<p>The tabernacle is God incarnate. For us to enter the tabernacle is for us to enter into God. Yes, in John 1 the tabernacle was present, indicating that God had come and was abiding among the disciples. However, these disciples were not yet in God. Although God was among them, they were still outside of Him. Before the incarnation, God was far away from them, dwelling in unapproachable light. But through incarnation He came to dwell among the disciples. In this way, God became approachable. Nevertheless, there was still no way for the disciples to enter into Him. When He went to the cross as the Lamb of God to die, He removed the obstacles-sin, sins, the world, and Satan-and He paved the way, and opened the entrance for us sinners to have a free entry into God.<p>Now we can see what the Father&#8217;s house is. The Father&#8217;s house in the New Testament was first the tabernacle, God in the flesh. Eventually, this tabernacle was destroyed when Christ was crucified. But in resurrection, the Son of God, who Himself is resurrection, not only raised up Himself, but also raised up all those who would believe in Him. In resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God, and all His believers became God&#8217;s many sons. This means that through and in Christ&#8217;s resurrection the many sons of God have been produced. Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we, the many sons of God, are stones for the building up of the Father&#8217;s house. This house is the church. Therefore, today&#8217;s church is the Father&#8217;s house, the house of the living God. Where are we today? We are not in the tabernacle portrayed in John 1:14. Rather, we are in the church, which is the house of God.<p>The church in the New Testament is the second stage of the Father&#8217;s house. The first stage of this house was God incarnate, God manifested in the flesh. The second stage is Christ resurrected with all His believers, the many sons built up together to be the church. Eventually, this church, the second stage of the Father&#8217;s house, will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation, the last stage, of the Father&#8217;s house in the New Testament. Today we are neither in the first stage nor in the third, but in the second. As those who are in the second stage, we are on our way to the third stage.<p>It is of vital importance that we see what the Father&#8217;s house is. The Father&#8217;s house is a matter of the Triune God-through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection- working Himself into His believers in order to be fully mingled with them that He may build them up as an organism for His dwelling place and expression. This is also for their dwelling place. Therefore, the sign of the Father&#8217;s house points to the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to produce a mutual dwelling place, a dwelling place for both God and His chosen and redeemed people.<p>We have seen that the incarnated Word as the tabernacle is God&#8217;s expression (John 1:1-2, 14, 18). This tabernacle is the Father&#8217;s dwelling place. The tabernacle, the Father&#8217;s dwelling place, is full of grace and reality. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son.<p>John 1:18 says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; The incarnated Word, the tabernacle, as God&#8217;s expression is for the declaration of the invisible God. The only begotten Son of God declares God with the glory of the Father. Therefore, with Christ as the tabernacle we have grace and reality with glory. On the mount of transfiguration, in particular, three of the Lord&#8217;s disciples saw His glory.<h2 class=head1>THE RESURRECTED TEMPLE</h2><p>The Father&#8217;s house is also the resurrected temple. This temple is Christ enlarged in resurrection as the house of God, the church. John 2:19-21 speaks of this: &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days? But He spoke of the temple of His body.&#8221;<p>The resurrected temple in John 2:19-21 is Christ raised up with His members, who are the many abodes in the Father&#8217;s house. These many abodes are also the many sons of God. All the sons of God together are the many abodes in the Father&#8217;s house. According to Ephesians 2:6 and 1 Peter 1:3, we, the members of Christ, have been raised up with Him.<p>The resurrected temple is built up a spiritual house with Christ as the foundation. Concerning the spiritual house, 1 Peter 2:5 says, &#8220;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house.&#8221; Concerning Christ as the foundation, 1 Corinthians 3:11 says, &#8220;For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p>The resurrected temple is the house of the living God, and this house is the pillar and base of the reality (1 Tim. 3:15). First Corinthians 3:16 and 17 also indicate clearly that the believers are the temple of God: &#8220;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are.&#8221;<p>Ephesians 2:21 and 22 reveal that the resurrected temple is the dwelling place of God in our spirit: &#8220;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&#8221; The fact that God&#8217;s dwelling place is in our spirit indicates that the church is in our spirit. Whenever we are out of the spirit and in our natural mind, we are outside of the church. Because the church life is in our spirit, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to our spirit and staying there. Many of us can testify that after coming into the church life, we have learned to turn to our spirit. However, sometimes we may leave the spirit and dwell in our natural mind. As a result, we may have questions concerning the church and problems with the church and with the saints. The longer we stay away from our spirit, the more questions and problems we shall have. But if we come back to our spirit and stay in the spirit, to us the church life will be wonderful. Today the Father&#8217;s house is in our regenerated spirit.<p>In the resurrected temple the believers dwell with Christ. In John 14:3 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&#8221; The Lord is in the Father (14:10-11). Through His death and resurrection He has brought His disciples into Himself. Because He is in the Father, therefore, they also are in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where He is, the disciples are also. Now in Christ we dwell with Him in the Father.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>We have seen that the sign of the Father&#8217;s house signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to be a dwelling place for both God and them. The ultimate consummation of the Father&#8217;s house will be the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with man in eternity (Rev. 21:2-3).<p>The New Jerusalem, as the consummation of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people, will be as a bride adorned for her husband. Concerning this, Revelation 21:2 says, &#8220;And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221;<p>According to Revelation 21:11, 18-21, the New Jerusalem will be built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. Gold signifies the nature of God the Father. Pearls signify God the Son&#8217;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection for regenerating God&#8217;s redeemed people. The precious stones signify God the Spirit&#8217;s work in transforming God&#8217;s regenerated people into materials for the building of God&#8217;s eternal habitation.<p>The New Jerusalem will be watered and nourished by the divine life (Rev. 22:1-2, 14, 17). The water will come from the river of life, and nourishment from the tree of life. The river is for drinking, and the tree is for nourishment. Both the river and the tree are of the divine life, and this life is actually the Triune God Himself.<p>According to the picture in Revelation 22, we have God the Father as the source of the water, God the Spirit as the flow of the water, and God the Son as the tree of life growing in the water. This is the Triune God as eternal life flowing to water His redeemed people and nourish them so that they may be absolutely one with Him and that they may dwell in Him and He in them for eternity.<p>The New Jerusalem will express God fully for eternity. This expression will be God&#8217;s glory. Revelation 21:11 says that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God. The glory of God is the expression of God, God expressed. For eternity we shall bear the glory of God for His expression in the New Jerusalem.<p>In order to understand what the Father&#8217;s house is, we need all the books of the Bible from Genesis 28 through Revelation 22. As we consider the revelation of the Father&#8217;s house in the Scriptures, we see that this house certainly is not a heavenly mansion. The concept that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 is a heavenly mansion is far off, and this concept needs to be discarded. Our Father&#8217;s house is a living organism composed of the Triune God mingled with all of His regenerated, transformed, and glorified believers. How wonderful!<p>This heavenly-mansion concept that has been injected into the believers distracts their attention away from certain vital matters. First, this concept turns the believers&#8217; attention away from the dispensing of the Triune God into us. A heavenly mansion does not require the dispensing of the Triune God into the believers. Those who believe in a heavenly mansion do not sense the need for the dispensing of the Triune God into them.<p>The thought of a heavenly mansion also distracts believers from the genuine building up in the church life. The building up of the church requires the Father&#8217;s nature, signified by gold; the Son&#8217;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, signified by pearls; and the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, signified by precious stones. But the building of a heavenly mansion does not require any of these things. If we are to have the building up of the genuine church life, we need gold, pearls, and precious stones; that is, we need the Father&#8217;s nature, the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection, and the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work.<p>Very few Christians today pay attention to the dispensing of the Triune God and to the experience of the nature of the Father, the Son&#8217;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, and the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work for the building up of the church. On the contrary, many Christians today are waiting to go to a heavenly mansion in the distant future. In the meantime, they may be living on earth in the flesh and enjoying the world, yet still expecting one day to go to a heavenly mansion. This is the damage caused by the leaven of the thought of a heavenly mansion. How much damage this concept has caused to Christians! We must thoroughly purge this leaven out of our being.<p>We need to return to the Body of Christ, the church. The Father&#8217;s house is today&#8217;s church life. The church life requires the dispensing of the Triune God into our being in a living, practical way so that we may be constituted of the Father&#8217;s nature, thoroughly realize the death and resurrection of Christ, and be fully transformed by the work of the Spirit. We need to treasure the church life much more than anyone could treasure the concept of a heavenly mansion. Such a concept is superstitious. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we have something real and practical-the local church life. The church life is real, and we are in it!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 18-20, 28a; 16:5-7, 16</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the second sign found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Son&#8217;s going and coming. This sign involves the process of Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. Why do we consider the Son&#8217;s going and coming to be a sign? We regard this as a sign because when the disciples heard about the Lord&#8217;s going and His coming, they understood it in a natural way. They thought that the Lord&#8217;s going meant that He would leave them and stay away from them forever. But the Lord&#8217;s going signifies something mysterious and divine. Notice that I use the word &#8220;signifies&#8221;; I do not use the word &#8220;means.&#8221; We are not speaking about what the Lord&#8217;s going means, but about what it signifies.<p>The Lord&#8217;s going was not merely a going away, a leaving. Rather, His going was a sign. The disciples, however, did not understand the significance of the Lord&#8217;s going. When they heard the word &#8220;go&#8221; come out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth, they understood it in a natural way. They did not realize at the time that the Lord&#8217;s going signified something deep, mysterious, and divine. Therefore, we need to see that the Lord&#8217;s going is a wonderful sign.<p>In the same principle, the Lord&#8217;s coming spoken of in John 14 is also a sign. Most Christians think that the Lord&#8217;s coming here refers to His second advent. But by the word &#8220;coming&#8221; the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later. Nevertheless, most Christians think that the Lord&#8217;s coming mentioned here is future. Thus, in their expositions they make this coming an event at least two thousand years after His going. Their exposition can be compared to Martha&#8217;s expounding of the Lord&#8217;s word in chapter eleven. After Lazarus had died, the Lord told Martha that her brother would rise again. She responded by saying that she knew that he would rise up in the last day. However, the Lord was trying to tell her that Lazarus would be raised up that very day because the Lord Himself is resurrection. In her exposition of the Lord&#8217;s word, Martha postponed the raising up of her brother until the distant future. Expositors make a similar mistake in expounding the meaning of &#8220;coming&#8221; in chapter fourteen. The Lord meant by the word &#8220;coming&#8221; a coming that was soon, a coming that would take place after a few days. But a number of expositors understand the word &#8220;coming&#8221; to refer to the Lord&#8217;s coming back at the end of this age. This understanding has nothing practical for our daily Christian life.<p>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Lord repeatedly explained to the disciples the significance of His going and coming. However, the disciples were preoccupied with their natural and traditional concept. No matter how much the Lord explained to them concerning His going and coming, they could not understand what He was saying. The situation is similar among most of today&#8217;s Christians. Christians today are occupied with traditional teaching and their natural understanding. Because of this preoccupation, they do not have the proper understanding of the Lord&#8217;s going and coming in John 14. Thus, there is the need for us to see that both the Lord&#8217;s going and His coming are signs indicating something deep, divine, and mysterious.<h2 class=head1>THE SON&#8217;S GOING</h2><p>The Son&#8217;s going is a sign of His all-inclusive death. For the Lord to go was for Him to go through an all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head2>To Solve the Problem of Sin</h2><p>Through His all-inclusive death, the Lord solved the problem of sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24). John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; The Lamb of God took away the sin of the world when He was crucified. This aspect of His crucifixion is included in the sign of His going in John 14. Have you ever realized that the Lord&#8217;s going was His crucifixion?<p>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; As we have seen, this is related to Christ as the sin offering (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). When the Lord was crucified, He was lifted up, as the brass serpent was lifted up by Moses.<h2 class=head2>To Terminate the Old Creation</h2><p>The Son&#8217;s going through death was also to terminate the old creation. Concerning this Paul says, &#8220;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect&#8221; (Rom. 6:6). This verse indicates that our old man, our old creation, has been crucified with Christ. When Christ went to the cross, He terminated the old creation.<h2 class=head2>To Judge the World</h2><p>John 12:31a says, &#8220;Now is the judgment of this world.&#8221; The world is an evil system, arranged systematically by Satan. Satan has systematized all the things on earth, especially those related to mankind, and the things in the air, into his kingdom of darkness to occupy and frustrate people from the purpose of God and distract them from the enjoyment of God. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, this evil system, the kingdom of darkness, was judged. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s going involved the judgment of the world.<h2 class=head2>To Destroy Satan and His Works</h2><p>By going through death the Lord also destroyed Satan and his works (John 12:31b; 16:11; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8; John 3:14). John 12:31b says, &#8220;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Through His death the Lord destroyed Satan, who had injected himself into man&#8217;s flesh (Heb. 2:14). By judging Satan (John 16:11), the Lord also judged the world. The Lord&#8217;s going included the destroying of Satan and his works.<p>When in John 14 the Lord said that He was going, He was indicating His all-inclusive death. The Lord&#8217;s going took away the sin of the world, terminated the old creation, judged the world, and cast out the ruler of the world, Satan. By this we can see how much is included in the Lord&#8217;s going.<p>The word &#8220;going&#8221; is very rich in its significance. Sin has been taken away, the sin offering has been offered, the world has been judged, and Satan has been destroyed. If the disciples in John 14 had realized the significance of the sign of the Lord&#8217;s going, they would have been excited and offered praise to God. How wonderful is the sign of the Son&#8217;s going!<h2 class=head2>To Abolish the Law of the Commandments and Ordinances</h2><p>Through His death on the cross Christ also abolished the law of the commandments and ordinances (Eph 2:14-16). One of these ordinances was that the Jews, God&#8217;s chosen people, could not be one with the Gentiles. In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus indicates that, as a result of His death, the Jews and the Gentiles can be one: &#8220;And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.&#8221; The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ, brought forth by life, which the Lord imparted into His members through His death (John 10:10-18). The &#8220;other sheep&#8221; in John 10:16 are the Gentiles. When these sheep are brought together with the Jewish sheep, there is one flock, one church, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers. However, as long as the ordinances of the law remained, the Jews were prohibited from being one with the Gentiles. Therefore, the Lord died on the cross to annul, to abolish, the law of commandments and ordinances.<p>Today there no longer are ordinances separating the Jewish and Gentile believers. The Lord&#8217;s purpose in dying to abolish the ordinances was that the Jewish and Gentile believers might be built up into one building, and this unique building is the Father&#8217;s house. Praise the Lord that through His going to the cross He removed all the obstacles and cleared the way for us to enter into the Triune God for the building up of the Father&#8217;s house! How profitable was His going!<h2 class=head2>To Release the Divine Life</h2><p>John 12:24 indicates that the Lord&#8217;s going, His death on the cross, was for the releasing of the divine life: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; According to this verse, when the Lord was crucified, He fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat in order to produce many grains. Here we see that the Lord died to release the divine life. Hence, His going was not only to take care of things on the negative side-to solve the problem of sin, terminate the old creation, judge the world, destroy Satan, and abolish the ordinances-but also to do something very positive-to release the divine life that was concealed within Him.<p>We need to see all that is signified by the sign of the Lord&#8217;s going. This sign includes the taking away of sin, the termination of the old creation, the judgment of the world, the destroying of Satan, the abolishing of the law of the commandments and ordinances, and the releasing of the divine life. What a wonderful sign! Not only did the disciples fail to understand this, but many of today&#8217;s Christians do not understand it either, even though it has been recorded in the Bible. How many believers realize that the Lord&#8217;s going was a sign of His all-inclusive death? It truly is a great matter that the problem of sin has been solved, that the old creation has been terminated, that the world has been judged, that Satan and his works have been destroyed, and that the law of commandments and ordinances has been abolished. It is also a great matter that through the Lord&#8217;s death the divine life has been released.<h2 class=head2>To Prepare a Place for His Believers to Enter into God</h2><p>Although we have covered many wonderful aspects of the Lord&#8217;s going, we need to cover one further aspect: preparing a place for His believers to enter into God. A great purpose of the Lord&#8217;s going was to prepare a place for His believers to enter into God (John 14:2-3). Through His death, the Lord opened the way for sinners to come into God. The way He prepared through His going is the new and living way mentioned in Hebrews 10:19-20: &#8220;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221; A living entry into the Triune God has been prepared by the Lord&#8217;s going. This is what the Lord meant when He said, &#8220;I go to prepare a place for you...that where I am you also may be&#8221; (John 14:2-3). The Lord is in the Father. However, before the Lord&#8217;s going through death, the disciples were still outside the Father. Hence, they were not in the place where the Lord is. Before the Son&#8217;s going, there was no way, no entry, for us sinners to come into the Father.<p>What we have in John 14:2 and 3 is not yet the building of the Father&#8217;s house; this is the way, the entry, into the building. After we enter into the Father, we receive His dispensing. Now that we are in Him, the Father dispenses His nature into our being. The Father&#8217;s nature is signified by gold (Rev. 21:18b, 21b). We also have the dispensing of the Son with His overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection signified by pearl (Rev. 21:21). Furthermore, we have the dispensing of the Spirit into our being, mainly for the purpose of transforming us and making us precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). This dispensing of the Triune God with the Father&#8217;s nature, the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection, and the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work is all for the building of the Father&#8217;s house.<p>The crucial point here is that apart from the Son&#8217;s going we would have no way to come into the Father. Without the Lord&#8217;s going, sinners cannot enter into the holy God. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord to go. Now we can praise Him for going and for doing everything signified by the sign of His going. Now there is a clear way for us to come into the Father. We can come boldly into the Father, and we are in Him now to enjoy His dispensing. This is the sign of the Lord&#8217;s going.<h2 class=head1>THE SON&#8217;S COMING</h2><p>The sign of the Son&#8217;s coming signifies His coming as the Spirit in resurrection. The Lord&#8217;s going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection. Actually, His going was His coming, for He came by going.<p>Without death we cannot have resurrection. Death is for resurrection. If we do not pass through death, we cannot be in resurrection. Hence, death is a preparatory step for resurrection. The Lord Jesus died so that He might enter into resurrection.<p>The Lord&#8217;s all-inclusive death was wonderful, and His resurrection was marvelous. I deeply appreciate the Lord&#8217;s death, and I appreciate also His resurrection. We have seen that through His death the Lord solved the problem of sin, terminated the old creation, judged the world, destroyed Satan, abolished the ordinances, released the divine life, and prepared a place for His believers to enter into God. Although all this is wonderful, we still need His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>The Last Adam Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>The sign of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection includes the fact that Christ, the last Adam, the One who is the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). Both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit are precious. For our enjoyment, we need both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit. When I am thirsty, I need a drink. In preparing a drink of water for me, my wife first cleans the cup. It is very good that the cup is now clean. But if my wife does nothing more than clean the cup, I will still be thirsty. I might say to her, &#8220;Dear, I appreciate having a clean cup. But I am thirsty, and I need water to drink.&#8221; When she puts water in the cup, I treasure the cup and the water. We may say that the cup signifies the Redeemer and that the water signifies the life-giving Spirit. In their experience, some Christians have the cup but no water. They treasure a cup without water, but we treasure the cup with the water. We treasure both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit. In death, the Lord Jesus was the Lamb, the Redeemer. But in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. How marvelous!<h2 class=head2>The Son Coming as the Spirit</h2><p>In resurrection the son comes to us as the Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ (John 20:19-22). Not only has Christ become the life-giving Spirit, but when He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit. He comes as the pneumatic Christ.<p>The Lord Jesus came to His disciples as the pneumatic Christ on the day of His resurrection. In chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples, who were in a place where the doors were shut, as the pneuma. The Greek word pneuma means spirit; it also means breath or air. In chapter one Christ was the Lamb, but in chapter twenty, after His death and in His resurrection, He was the pneumatic Christ. The first time He came, He came as the Lamb of God. The second time He came as the pneuma. According to John 20:22, &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord came to them as breath, as air.<p>When we receive Christ today, we receive the pneumatic Christ. This means that we receive not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ. What kind of Christ are you enjoying? Do you enjoy only the redeeming Christ? Do you not also enjoy the life-giving Christ? Praise the Lord that we are enjoying not only the redeeming Christ but also the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Christ!<p>Our Christ is pneumatic. To say that He is the pneumatic Christ means that He is full of divine air. Just as a car tire must be pneumatic, that is, full of air, so every Christian should be pneumatic, full of heavenly air. In our daily life we should not be &#8220;flat,&#8221; short of the divine air, short of the divine breath. Unfortunately, most Christians are flat.<p>Our spiritual air is the Spirit. In resurrection Christ has come to us as the Spirit, the pneuma. How is it possible for the Lord Jesus to be pneumatic? The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection. Resurrection is a sign that Christ the Redeemer has become the pneumatic Christ.<h2 class=head2>As the Spirit Coming to Enter into the Believers</h2><p>As the Spirit Christ enters into the believers (John 14:17-18, 20; 17:26b; 15:4a, 5a). This means that Christ not only comes to us-He enters into us. Christ can come into us because He is pneumatic. We simply need to breathe Him in as the divine pneuma. We know from experience that even when we are not aware of it, the heavenly air enters into us.<h2 class=head2>To Impart the Divine Life into the Believers</h2><p>In resurrection Christ imparts the divine life into the believers (John 3:15-16; 10:10b). Through His death the divine life was released. Now this life is imparted to our being by the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. The redeeming Christ is now the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, and this pneumatic Christ enters into us to impart the divine life to us. By this we see that the divine life has been imparted to our being not only through the Lord&#8217;s death but also through His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>To Live in and with the Believers</h2><p>As the Spirit in resurrection, Christ lives in and with the believers (John 14:19; 6:57; Gal. 2:20). This means that He becomes one with us. He and we have one life. Because of His resurrection, we and the Lord have one life, and we live together with Him.<h2 class=head2>To Bring the Believers into the Father, That Where He Is They Also May Be</h2><p>In resurrection Christ brings the believers into the Father so that where He is they also may be (John 14:10a, 11a, 3, 20; 17:21, 24). This is to be in the Father&#8217;s house. Through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection, through His going and coming, we have entered into the Father&#8217;s house.<p>We have not only entered into the Father&#8217;s house, but we have even become part of the Father&#8217;s house. John 14:23 says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; The abode here is one of the many abodes mentioned in verse 2, where the Lord says, &#8220;In my Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s word here indicates that the believers become abodes in the Father&#8217;s house.<p>Today we all are part of the church life, part of the Father&#8217;s house, through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection and in the pneumatic Christ, who now lives within us. The pneumatic Christ makes us one with the Triune God, and this oneness is the Father&#8217;s house. This is the Body of Christ, which is an organism of the Triune God.<p>This marvelous organism is infinitely better than a so-called heavenly mansion. Such a mansion would not be pneumatic. But today&#8217;s church is pneumatic. The church is an organism full of pneuma. Instead of looking forward to a heavenly mansion, I prefer to remain in the church enjoying the pneumatic Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:4-6</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the sign of the way, the reality, and the life as seen in John 14:4-6. In verse 4 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;And you know where I go, and you know the way.&#8221; I would call your attention to the words &#8220;where&#8221; and &#8220;way&#8221; in this verse. In verse 5 Thomas says to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?&#8221; Here the words &#8220;where&#8221; and &#8220;way&#8221; are used again. According to verse 6, &#8220;Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; In verse 4 Jesus speaks of the &#8220;where&#8221; and the &#8220;way.&#8221; In verse 5 Thomas says that the disciples do not know where or know the way. Then in verse 6 Jesus says that He is the way and indicates that the &#8220;where&#8221; is the Father. Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons. The way is the Son, who is also the reality and the life, and the where, the place, is the Father. The Father is the &#8220;where,&#8221; and the Son is the way.<p>We have seen that in 14:4-6 the Father is the place and the Son is the way. But what does it mean to take the Lord Jesus as the way to the Father? It means that when we take Jesus, we get the Father. When we walk in Him as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father. Hence, we take Jesus as the way, and we reach the Father as the place.<p>These three verses in chapter fourteen are very deep, and the three matters in verse 6-the way, the reality, and the life-are signs. We may say that, taken together, these are the third sign in chapter fourteen. The first sign was the Father&#8217;s house, and the second was the Lord&#8217;s coming and going. Now the third is the way, the reality, and the life.<p>For years I have been seeking to know the meaning of the way, the reality, and the life in John 14:6. We need to ask what is the meaning of &#8220;way&#8221; here. Furthermore, what does it mean to say that Christ is the reality? In most English versions the Greek word for reality is rendered truth. If the word truth is used, what does it mean here? Doctrine? Faithfulness? Sincerity? Is Christ doctrine? Is He faithfulness and sincerity here? It is not easy to explain the meaning of reality in this verse. Also, because life is mysterious, it is difficult to say what is the meaning of the word &#8220;life&#8221; here.<p>We cannot understand these matters properly if we consider these verses merely according to the black and white letters. We need to realize that the way, the reality, and the life are a sign. The way, the reality, and the life signify certain things. We may consider these three as one sign in three aspects, steps, or stages, or we may regard them as three separate signs.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY-TO ENTER INTO THE FATHER</h2><p>Let us now consider the significance of the way. To make this matter easier to understand, we may use a jumbo jet as an illustration. The best and fastest way to travel from the United States to Europe is on a jumbo jet. A jumbo jet can easily overcome gravity and bring people safely and comfortably through the air to their destination. The passengers in a jumbo jet need not be frustrated by wind or rain, for the jet carries them through everything. Hence, the jumbo jet is their way of reaching a particular place.<p>This is a picture of how the Lord Jesus is our way to the Father. The Father is holy, dwelling in unapproachable light, and we are sinful. We are also involved with the world, Satan, and other negative things, all of which are obstacles that make it impossible for us to come to the Father. It is impossible for us to overcome these negative things and to clear the way. This is the reason Confucius says that we should not offend heaven (a term he used for God, similar to that used in Luke 15), for he claimed that if we offended heaven, there would be no way for us to be forgiven. This indicates that, for Confucius, there was no way for sinful human beings to contact God, because we cannot solve the problems of sin, the world, Satan, and all manner of negative things. Sin, the world, and Satan are three great obstacles that make access to the Father impossible. But praise the Lord that Christ is our way to the Father! We may say that He is &#8220;Jumbo Jesus,&#8221; the means by which we may come to the Father.<p>In the foregoing message we saw that, through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, and Satan. This means that He has cleared away all the negative things, all the obstacles, between us and God. Now, having dealt with the negative things, the Lord Himself is our way to the Father. We simply need to enter into Him as our &#8220;Jumbo Jet,&#8221; and He will transport us to the Father. He is the way for us to enter into the Father. Through His death, Christ has cleared the path, and now He Himself becomes our way into the Father. He is the real jumbo jet that brings us safely into God. How can we go to the Father? How can we contact Him? The only way is through &#8220;Jumbo Jesus.&#8221; He, and He alone, is the way into the Father.<p>As a sign, the way indicates that sin has been dealt with, the world has been judged, Satan has been destroyed, and the old creation has been terminated. Hence, sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation are no longer obstacles that hinder us from coming to the Father. Hallelujah, Christ has cleared away every obstacle!<p>Although we may have realized in the past that the Lord Jesus is the way to the Father, we may not have realized how much is signified by Him as the way. We all need to see that the sign of the way signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with and that in the Lord Jesus we have a way to reach God the Father.<p>I hope that more of our Jewish friends may see the sign of the way in 14:6. Many Jews are God-fearing people. They respect God and in a sense they also love Him. However, I believe that most Jews would tell you that they actually do not have a way to contact God. Rather, they may sense that God is far from them and that they do not have a way to come to Him. This feeling of distance is the result of sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation standing as obstacles between them and God. Although the Jewish people may fear God, respect God, and love God, they do not have a way to reach God. Neither is there a way for God to visit them. For this reason, even when they are gathering in the synagogues on the Sabbath, they may have the feeling that God is far away in the heavens and that they are on earth. Not only is there a great distance between them and God, but there are also many obstacles keeping them from contacting Him. Therefore, they do not have the sense that they are one with God and that God is one with them.<p>Our situation is very different from that of the Jews. If we want to contact God, we simply need to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; By calling on the name of the Lord, we &#8220;board&#8221; the &#8220;Jumbo Jesus,&#8221; who immediately takes us to the Father. Many of us can testify that through calling on the name of the Lord we are brought into God. We also have the sense that God is in us. We know that God is in us and that we are in Him.<p>The Jews who honor God and fear Him cannot testify from their experience that they are in God and that God is in them. The reason is that they are not willing to take the &#8220;Jumbo.&#8221; Even when they are offered a free &#8220;ticket,&#8221; they are not willing to use it. The Jewish saints among us have testified that when they were in Judaism they did not enjoy God. But after they came into the church life and began to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him, they knew that they were in God, that God was in them, and that they were one with God. This is possible only because the Lord Jesus is the new and living way into the Father (Heb. 10:19-20). Hallelujah, as soon as we board our &#8220;Jumbo Jesus,&#8221; we are one with Him and one with God. We are brought into the Father to enjoy Him. This is a fact, and this is our experience.<p>As Christians we can testify that we have God, that we enjoy God, and that God enjoys us. Oh, how much I enjoy God through the Lord Jesus as the way! The Lord has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation. Now everything is clear, and there are no longer any obstacles between us and God. When we call on the Lord, we are immediately in the presence of God. We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with God. Then God becomes our enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>The Crucified Jesus and the Resurrected Christ  with His Redemption</h2><p>The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and the resurrected Christ with His redemption (John 14:2b-3; Heb. 10:19). Once again we would emphasize the fact that the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with. All this is signified by the crucified Jesus. However, the way not only includes the crucified Jesus, but also includes the resurrected Christ with His redemption.<h2 class=head2>Access in the Spirit unto the Father</h2><p>Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. When we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us. Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. Actually, this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.<h2 class=head2>A New and Living Way</h2><p>According to Hebrews 10:20, the Lord Jesus as our way into the Father is a new and living way: &#8220;By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY</h2><p>In 14:6 the Lord also says that He is the reality. Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality. The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is the reality. Actually, the way is God Himself, and this way is the reality. If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus, we would not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.<p>What is the reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus? This reality is the being and the doing of the Triune God. First, this reality is the incarnated God (John 1:1, 14). This reality is also the Son (John 8:32, 36) and the Spirit (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:7). Hence, the reality is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done. This is the gospel (Eph. 1:13). The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.<p>In the universe only what God is and what God does is real. This means that the reality in the universe is God&#8217;s being and God&#8217;s doing. God&#8217;s being is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption. In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.<p>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination. When we get on the way, we reach the destination. This means that when we receive Jesus, we have the Father. When we receive the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination. Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father. This is the reality becoming the way. This is the Son with what He has done becoming our way to the Father. How can we get on this way? Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. When we call on the Lord&#8217;s name, we are on the way, and we have the Father.<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE</h2><p>In 14:6 the Lord Jesus goes on to say that He is the life. Reality is the divine life, and the divine life, which is eternal life, is the Triune God. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us to be our life. Therefore, the life in 14:6 signifies the Triune God within us (Eph. 4:18; Col. 3:4a; Rom. 8:2a, 6b).<p>Many of us can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. We have something living, moving, and acting within us. This is the Triune God within us as the divine life. This life brings us the reality, and the reality is the way for us to enter into God. This is the way, and the way is the destination.<p>Whenever we call on the Lord Jesus, we experience the Triune God within us as life. This is the divine life that brings us reality, and this reality is the way. When we are on the way, we are also at the destination.<p>Do you know where we are today? We are where the Son is-in the Father. We may say that we are in the Son with the Father and also in the Father with the Son. This is the oneness between us and the Triune God. Jesus Christ is in the Father, and we are in Him also. Where He is, there we are also. He is in the Father, and we are in the Father by being in Him. This means that through Christ as the way we have been brought into God. The life brings us the reality, the reality is the way, the way is one with the destination, and this destination is God and the Father Himself.<p>Those who fear and honor God but do not believe in the Lord Jesus would have to testify that they never have had the sense that God is in them and that they are in God. Instead, they may realize that they are sinful and that they have the problems with the world, Satan, and other negative things. They may have a God who is in the heavens, but not a God who dwells within them. Our experience as believers in Christ is absolutely different. We have the assurance to say with a pure conscience, &#8220;God is in me, and I am in God. God and I are one. All the obstacles between us have been removed. Sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with. Now I have life and reality, and this reality is the way. I am on the way, and I reach the destination. I have God, the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&#8221;<p>In 14:6 the Lord Jesus clearly says, &#8220;I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; Because Christ is the way, the reality, and the life, when we have Him, we have the life, the reality, and the way. When we are on the way, we are also at the destination. Our testimony and experience is that we are in the Triune God and the Triune God is in us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:7-15</h1><p>In the foregoing message we emphasized the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son, is the way to the Father (14:6). We used flying on a jumbo jet as an illustration of the Lord as the way into God, saying that &#8220;Jumbo Jesus&#8221; is the way to the Father. Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are brought by Him and in Him to the Father. After that message was given, a Chinese lady, who had been invited to the meeting by a friend, told us how she experienced Christ as the way to the Father. Before the meeting, she was an unbeliever. But as a result of the meeting, she believed in the Lord and called on His name. She testified that by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus she was immediately brought into the Father. She also said that this was much faster than any jumbo jet. I appreciated her testimony very much.<p>No matter how fast a jumbo jet may go, it still must travel a certain distance before it brings you to your destination. However, our &#8220;Jumbo Jesus&#8221; does not have to take us any distance at all, for He is both the way and the destination. This means that when we get into Him as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father. Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God. Hallelujah, because we are in Christ we are immediately brought into the Father! We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery can testify that this is not a mere doctrine-it is a spiritual fact. From experience we can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way. The Lord Jesus is the way for us to enter into God.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Thus far, we have covered three signs found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Father&#8217;s house, the sign of the Son&#8217;s going and coming, and the sign of the way, the reality, and the life. With this message we shall begin to consider the fourth sign in these chapters-the sign of the divine Trinity, which is for the dispensing of the Triune God.<p>Many Christians treasure chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel. But many readers have not seen that these chapters actually are on the divine Trinity. Of course, the entire Bible reveals the Triune God. Our God is triune: He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Although this revelation is found in the Bible as a whole, no other portion of the Word reveals the Triune God as fully as these four chapters do. As one who has been studying John 14 through 17 for more than fifty years, I can say that these chapters are deep, profound, and mysterious, far beyond our ability to understand fully. After years of study and experience I can say that these four chapters certainly are concerned with the Triune God. From God&#8217;s side, these chapters reveal how the Triune God dispenses Himself into the believers. From our side, these chapters reveal the way for us to enter into the Triune God, enjoy Him, experience Him, and possess Him. On the one hand, the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us; on the other hand, we may enter into Him, experience Him, enjoy Him, and possess Him.<p>Because chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John reveal the Triune God both from the aspect of His dispensing Himself into us and from the aspect of our experience of Him, these chapters are extremely crucial. The most vital point in these chapters concerns the Triune God Himself. Through my study I have found ten matters related to the Father, seventeen matters related to the Son, and eleven matters related to the Spirit. After giving a preliminary word in this message, we shall go on to consider in the messages following all the points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As we shall see, these matters will require much further study.<h2 class=head1>THE THREE-ONE GOD</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, theologians have been studying the Triune God, and there have been many debates concerning the Trinity of the Godhead. Not many Christians have realized that the divine Trinity is not for doctrine, but for our experience. As we have seen, the Trinity is for the dispensing of the Triune God into us. However, if we regard the Trinity merely as a doctrine, we shall have difficulty, because no one can adequately define the Trinity in a doctrinal way.<p>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament tell us that God is uniquely one (Deut. 4:35, 39; Psa. 86:10; 1 Cor. 8:4; 1 Tim. 2:5). Beside Him, there is no other God. Although God is unique, He is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. There is no doubt that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three. In the Gospels the Son prayed to the Father, the Father spoke to the Son, and the Father sent the Spirit to be upon the Son. It is not possible for us to explain doctrinally how God can be one and yet three. Our mind is too limited for this. We simply are not able to analyze the Person of the Godhead; we are not able to explain how He is three yet still one.<p>Our God is triune. This is a Latin word composed of two words: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one. Hence, to say that God is triune is to say that He is three-one. The Triune God is the three-one God. In the natural mind we may think of either one or three, but we do not have the thought of three-one. However, in the divine concept there is the matter of God&#8217;s being three-one. This expression three-one is better than three-in-one. According to the Bible, we should simply believe the fact that God is three-one. He is one-the unique God, yet He is three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON, AND HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The name of God as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was not made clear until after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. According to Matthew 28:19, after His resurrection the Lord came to His disciples and said to them, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we see that there is one name; yet it is the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit. This is a three-one name. After His resurrection, the Lord charged His disciples to baptize people into the three-one name: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<p>Perhaps you are wondering why before Christ&#8217;s resurrection the divine revelation does not clearly indicate that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In the Old Testament plural pronouns are used with respect to God. For example, Genesis 1:26 says, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; The pronouns &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; indicate that the unique God is triune. If God were not triune, how could Genesis 1:26 refer to Him as &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;? Elsewhere in the Old Testament there are indications that God is one and yet three. Consider Isaiah 6:8: &#8220;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&#8221; In this verse the pronouns &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; are used for God. This is an indication that God is three-one.<p>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are one long discourse followed by a lengthy prayer recorded in chapter seventeen. These four chapters speak of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Although much is said in these chapters concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, nothing is as clear as Matthew 28:19. In this one verse the Lord speaks explicitly concerning the three of the Godhead, telling the disciples to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This word is brief, but it is definite and crystal clear. If we compare this verse with what is recorded in the other Gospels and in the Old Testament, we shall see that it was only when the Lord had entered into resurrection that the three of the Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are clearly revealed.<h2 class=head1>COMPLETE AND COMPLETED</h2><p>Now we come to a very important matter that requires careful attention. Before the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Trinity was not completed. I do not say that the Trinity was not perfect or that the Trinity was not complete. I am saying that the Trinity was not completed before Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Some may be bothered by such a statement and say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t God eternally complete? How, then, can you say that the Trinity was not completed until after the resurrection of Christ?&#8221; To such questions we would reply that, on the one hand, God is complete. But, on the other hand, before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection His Trinity was not completed. To be complete is one thing, and to be completed is another thing.<p>Let us try to give an illustration of the difference between being complete and being completed. In this illustration we may refer to the recently finished meeting hall in Stuttgart, Germany. Suppose you were to ask the brothers in Stuttgart if their meeting hall is complete. In their answer, the brothers should say, &#8220;Yes, according to the blueprint, our meeting hall is complete. This building has everything we need. However, according to the building process, the meeting hall has not yet been completed. We plan to have a complete building, but the entire building has not yet been completed, for certain parts of the building still need more work.&#8221; We may say, then, that there is a complete building but not yet a completed building.<h2 class=head2>The Completed Spirit</h2><p>In the Gospel of John there is a verse that points out that, before the resurrection of Christ, the Trinity was complete but not completed. John 7:39 says, &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; What does it mean to say that &#8220;the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified&#8221;? In chapter seven of John, the Lord Jesus was still in the flesh; He was not yet in glory, that is, not yet in resurrection. Because He was not yet resurrected, the Spirit was not yet. Of course, the Spirit of God existed from the very beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was &#8220;not yet&#8221; until the Lord was glorified in resurrection. After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ. This involves the matter of process.<p>In Genesis 1:2 we have the Spirit of God. The only element in the Spirit of God is the divine essence. But after the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit became the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. When the Spirit of God was just the Spirit of God, the only element in the Spirit was the divine essence. But when the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus, the essence of humanity was added.<p>Let us use tea as an illustration of how the essence of humanity has been added to the Spirit of God so that this Spirit is now the Spirit of Jesus. In order to make tea, a tea bag is placed in water. We may say that the result is tea-water. Suppose milk and sugar are now added to this cup of tea. First there was plain water. Then after the tea was added, there was tea-water. After milk and sugar are added, we have milk-sugar-tea-water. In a similar way, with the Spirit of God we have only the divine essence. But the Spirit has become the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This means that other elements-humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection-have been added to the Spirit of God. Before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, this Spirit, the Spirit including humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection, was not yet. We may say that the Spirit, although complete, was not yet completed. But after Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the Spirit was completed. Then the Spirit of God became the all-inclusive Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.<p>We need to see that the only element in the Spirit of God was divinity. But when the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ, other elements were added to the Spirit of God. The Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ now includes the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now that the Spirit includes these elements, we may say that the Spirit has been completed.<p>Suppose you ask for a cup of tea with milk and sugar. If you are served a cup of tea without milk and sugar, you would say that your cup of tea has not been completed. But when you add milk and sugar to the tea, your drink will be completed, for the necessary elements have been added to it. This is an illustration of the Spirit becoming completed. Just as the drink you requested was not yet because milk and sugar had not been added to it, so the Spirit was not yet until Christ had been resurrected and the necessary elements of crucifixion and resurrection had been added to the Spirit. Today we cannot say that the Spirit is &#8220;not yet,&#8221; because the Spirit has been completed.<p>Although the Trinity was complete, one of the Three- the Spirit-was not completed before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Because the Spirit was not completed, the Spirit was not yet until the Lord was glorified. When the Lord Jesus was glorified, the element of resurrection was added to the Spirit. Then the Spirit was completed. Now the Spirit is not only complete-the Spirit is also completed. Therefore, after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus could speak clearly and definitely concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Completed Son</h2><p>We have seen that before Christ&#8217;s resurrection the Spirit was not completed. Now we need to see that the Son also was not completed before resurrection. Do you think that the Son was completed before incarnation? The Son could not have been completed before incarnation because it was necessary for the completed Son to have not only divinity but also humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Therefore, in order to be completed, the Son had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.<p>As a result of going through this process, the only begotten Son (John 3:16) became the firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29). Before incarnation, there was not the element of humanity in the only begotten Son. Of course, neither were the elements of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection in the only begotten Son before His incarnation. Instead, there was only the element of divinity in Him. But now that the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son of God, the firstborn Son includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the completed Son.<p>Because it was necessary for both the Son and the Spirit to be completed, before His resurrection the Lord Jesus did not speak a clear word to His disciples concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. But after His resurrection, He could tell His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. After the Lord&#8217;s resurrection the Father is complete and both the Son and the Spirit have been completed.<p>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Son still had not been completed. At that time He was in the flesh; He had not yet been crucified and entered into resurrection. Furthermore, the Spirit had not yet been completed. But in Matthew 28:19, after Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the Son and the Spirit are not only complete but also completed.<p>Although the Son and the Spirit have been completed, the Father did not need any completion. The Father remains the same because He is the source, and the source does not need completion. The Son, however, needed completion. In the first stage He was God&#8217;s only begotten Son. In the last stage He has become the firstborn Son of God. For the only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son there was the need of completion, the need of a process. This process includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. After passing through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, He entered into resurrection. Now in resurrection He is not merely the only begotten Son; He is the Firstborn among many sons. As we have pointed out, this firstborn Son of God includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now He is not only complete-He is completed. Hallelujah for the complete and completed Son of God!<h2 class=head2>The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Through the process by which He was completed, the only begotten Son not only became the firstborn Son of God, but also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). To God, He became the Firstborn; to us, He became the life-giving Spirit. This firstborn Son of God, who is the life-giving Spirit, is now our way to the Father. He is the &#8220;jumbo jet&#8221; that brings us to the Father. When we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son as the way, and immediately we are in the Father. The life-giving Spirit is the firstborn Son of God, and the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, when we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son, and by being in the Son we are in the Father.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:7-15</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the fourth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John-the sign of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER</h2><h2 class=head2>The Source, the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer</h2><p>The Father is the source; He is the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer. According to John 7:29, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.&#8221; This brief word indicates that the Father is the source. As the source, the Father sent the Son. John 13:3 also indicates that the Father is the source: &#8220;Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&#8221; The Father is the Planner, and He sent the Son to carry out His plan. Because the Father is the Originator and the Initiator, the Son came forth from Him and received all from Him.<h2 class=head2>Having the Will</h2><p>In the Godhead the Father is the One who has the will. In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.&#8221; In John 6:39-40 the Lord goes on to speak of the will of Him who sent Him and the will of His Father. As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus never did His own will. Instead, He always did the Father&#8217;s will. He was sent by the Father not to carry out His own will, but to carry out the will of the Father. The Son is one with the Father, and the Son&#8217;s will is the Father&#8217;s will. This means that the Father and the Son have just one will. We should not think that the Father has a will and the Son has another will. No, there is only one will, and this is the will of the Father. The Son came to accomplish the Father&#8217;s will.<h2 class=head2>Dwelling in Unapproachable Light</h2><p>The Father dwells in unapproachable light. Concerning this point, 1 Timothy 6:16 says, &#8220;Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see.&#8221; No one can approach the Father. Actually, this unapproachable light is a burning fire. It is impossible for anyone to approach such a light.<h2 class=head2>Sending the Son</h2><p>Many verses in the Gospel of John speak of the Father&#8217;s sending the Son. In 4:34 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.&#8221; John 5:24 says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life.&#8221; According to 5:30, the Lord did not seek His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him. Then in 5:36 the Lord says, &#8220;The works themselves which I do testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.&#8221; Then in the next verse the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;The Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me.&#8221; In 6:38 the Lord says that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him, and in verse 57 He says that the living Father sent Him. In 7:16 the Lord says, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.&#8221; In the same chapter the Lord says that the One who sent Him is true (vv. 28-29). John 13:20 says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I shall send receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&#8221; In 14:24 the Lord says, &#8220;The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father&#8217;s who sent Me.&#8221; According to 15:21, the disciples will be persecuted because their persecutors do not know Him who sent the Son. In 16:5 the Lord says, &#8220;Now I go to Him who sent Me.&#8221; In His prayer to the Father in chapter seventeen, the Lord also refers to the Father&#8217;s sending Him into the world: &#8220;As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world&#8221; (v. 18). Elsewhere in this prayer the Lord indicates that the disciples believe that the Father sent the Son (v. 8). If we study these verses, plus others in the Gospel of John, we shall learn why, how, and when the Father sent the Son.<h2 class=head2>Coming with the Son</h2><p>In John 16:32 the Lord indicates that the Father came with the Son: &#8220;Behold, an hour is coming and has come, when you shall be scattered each to his own, and shall leave Me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.&#8221; The Father sent the Son, and the Father was with the Son; that is, the Father came with the Son. We may find this difficult to understand. If someone sends you to a certain place, that person will usually remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place. But in the divine economy the Father sends the Son, and when the Son comes, the Father comes with the Son. On the one hand, the Father sent the Son; on the other hand, He came with the Son.<p>Bible students may have difficulty explaining how the Father could both send the Son and come with the Son. The reason for this difficulty is that some try to separate the Father from the Son. However, the Father and the Son cannot be separated. Actually, when the Father sent the Son, He sent Himself in the Son. The Gospel of John reveals definitely that the Son was sent by the Father and that the Father came with Him. Furthermore, according to John&#8217;s Gospel, where the Son is, there the Father is also, and when the Son speaks, the Father also speaks in Him. John 10:30 says clearly, &#8220;I and the Father are one.&#8221; The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son. When the Son speaks, therefore, the Father speaks His word.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that it is beyond our ability to analyze how the Father and the Son are one. We are not even able to analyze ourselves thoroughly. For instance, we know that the mind, the emotion, and the will are distinct. However, we cannot separate them. We cannot separate the mind from the emotion or the emotion from the will and then analyze these parts of our being separately. We know that a human being is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. But if we could separate these parts and analyze them, we would be killed. As soon as the three parts of a person are separated, the person dies. Although the spirit, soul, and body are distinct, they form a complete human being. Hence, where the body is, there the soul and the spirit are also.<p>We may use this picture as an illustration of the relationship between the Father and the Son. Where the Father is, there the Son is, and where the Son is, there the Father is. Furthermore, when the Son speaks, the Father speaks as well. Is this one speaking or two speakings? Perhaps we should say it is two-one speaking. Concerning the Father&#8217;s sending the Son and coming with the Son, we should not analyze, but instead simply believe whatever the Bible says.<h2 class=head2>Living and Working in the Son</h2><p>In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.&#8221; Here we see the Father living and working in the Son.<h2 class=head2>Giving All That He Has to the Son, Thus Embodied in the Son</h2><p>In John 16:15 the Lord says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; This indicates that the Father has given all that He has to the Son. Thus, the Father is embodied in the Son. Regarding this, Paul says in Colossians 2:9, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; The Father has given all that He has and is to the Son. The Father&#8217;s being and doing are altogether in the Son. Hence, the Son becomes the Father&#8217;s embodiment.<h2 class=head2>Glorified in the Son</h2><p>According to John 13:31, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.&#8221; When the Son was glorified, the Father was glorified in Him. Later, we shall devote a full message to the matter of glorification.<h2 class=head2>Giving the Son to Us</h2><p>The Father has also given the Son to us (John 3:16). The Son given to us by the Father is the embodiment of the Father. Therefore, when the Son is given, the Father also is given to us. For the Father to give us the Son means that the Father gives us Himself in the Son.<h2 class=head2>Dwelling in Us with the Son by the Spirit</h2><p>The Father dwells in us with the Son and by the Spirit. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; Here we have the Father dwelling in us with the Son. First John 3:24 says, &#8220;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; Here we see that the Father dwells in us not only with the Son but also by the Spirit. Concerning this matter, 1 John 4:13 says, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit.&#8221;<p>Who is dwelling in us? We should answer this question by saying that the Father dwells in us with the Son by the Spirit. In other words, we have the Triune God dwelling in us. How marvelous!<h2 class=head1>THE SON</h2><p>Let us go on to consider a number of matters related to the Son.<h2 class=head2>The Expression, the Accomplisher</h2><p>The Son is the expression of the Father: &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18). The Father is the source, and the Son is His expression. As the expression of the Father, the Son is the Accomplisher. The Father is the Initiator, the Originator, the Planner, and the Designer, and the Son carries out what the Father has initiated, originated, planned, and designed. Hence, the Son, the expression of the Father, is the Accomplisher.<h2 class=head2>Coming with the Father</h2><p>John 6:46 says, &#8220;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from with (lit.) God, He has seen the Father.&#8221; And John 8:29 says, &#8220;He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone.&#8221; These verses reveal that when the Son came, He did not come alone, but came with the Father.<h2 class=head2>Tabernacling among Us</h2><p>John 1:14 reveals that the Son tabernacled among us: &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; John 16:4b also refers to this: &#8220;Now these things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you.&#8221; The Son is God&#8217;s tabernacle. Actually, as God&#8217;s tabernacle, He is God embodied among us.<h2 class=head2>Coming in the Name of the Father</h2><p>The Lord says in John 5:43, &#8220;I have come in the name of My Father.&#8221; The Son came not only with the Father, but also in the Father&#8217;s name. This indicates that He came as the Father. Hence, He, as the Son given to us, is called the Father (Isa. 9:6).<h2 class=head2>Not Only Coexisting but Also Coinhering with the Father</h2><p>The Son not only coexists with the Father, but also coinheres with the Father. What is the difference between coexisting and coinhering? To coexist is to exist together at the same time. To coinhere is to exist in one another, to dwell in one another. To say that the Father and the Son coexist means that they exist together. But to say that the Father and the Son coinhere means that they dwell in one another. We have a word concerning this coinherence in John 14:10a: &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?&#8221; Here we have the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. In John 14:11a the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.&#8221; The Bible not only says that the Son and the Father are with each other; the Bible also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere; that is, the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. John 17:21 is another verse that reveals this coinherence: &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&#8221;<p>It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence. The coexistence of the Son and the Father means that They exist together. The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son. Because of this coinherence of the Father and the Son, we may say that They are two-one.<h2 class=head2>The Son and the Father Being One Thus the Son Being the Father</h2><p>The Son and the Father are one. In John 10:30 the Lord Jesus declared, &#8220;I and the Father are one.&#8221; Because the Son and the Father are one, the Son is called the Father. According to Isaiah 9:6, the Son given to us is called the eternal Father. Thus, He is the Father.<p>A number of verses in the New Testament indicate that the Son and the Father are one. John 17:22 says, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&#8221; In 1 John 2:25 the singular pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; is used to refer to both the Son and the Father: &#8220;And this is the promise which He promised us, the eternal life.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;He&#8221; refers to the Son and the Father spoken of in the preceding verse. This indicates that the Son and the Father are one. We see the same principle in 1 John 2:28: &#8220;And now, little children, abide in Him, that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&#8221; In this verse the pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. Along with the preceding clause, &#8220;abide in Him,&#8221; which is a repetition of the clause in 1 John 2:27 involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit. In 1 John 2:29 the personal pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; denotes the Triune God: &#8220;If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him.&#8221; &#8220;He&#8221; denotes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all-inclusively, because this pronoun refers to &#8220;He&#8221; and &#8220;Him&#8221; in the preceding verse, which denote the coming Son, and it also denotes &#8220;Him&#8221; in this verse, referring to the Father who has begotten us. This indicates strongly that the Son and the Father are one.<h2 class=head2>Living Because of the Father</h2><p>In John 6:57a the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;The living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father.&#8221; Here we see that the Son lives because of the Father. The Father is the cause of the Son&#8217;s living. Without the Father, the Son has no way to live. This verse is also a further indication that the Son and the Father are one.<h2 class=head2>Working with the Father</h2><p>The Son works with the Father. John 14:10b says, &#8220;The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.&#8221; Here we see that the Son speaks, and the Father works. The Son&#8217;s speaking is the Father&#8217;s working. In John 5 the Lord also reveals that He works with the Father. &#8220;My Father is working until now, and I am working&#8221; (v. 17). In verse 19 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>Working in the Name of the Father</h2><p>The Son not only worked with the Father, but also worked in the Father&#8217;s name (John 10:25). This indicates that He worked as the Father, because He and the Father are one (10:30).<h2 class=head2>Doing the Father&#8217;s Will</h2><p>The Son and the Father have one will. The Son does the will of the Father. In John 5:30 the Lord says, &#8220;I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.&#8221; Then in John 6:38 the Lord testified that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him.<h2 class=head2>Speaking the Father&#8217;s Word</h2><p>The Son speaks the Father&#8217;s word. Whatever is spoken by the Son is the word of the Father, because the Son does not speak His own word, but speaks the Father&#8217;s word. In John 14:24 the Lord says concerning this, &#8220;He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father&#8217;s who sent Me.&#8221; In John 7:16 the Lord said regarding His teaching, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.&#8221; The Son speaks the Father&#8217;s word because the Son does not speak from Himself: &#8220;For I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who sent Me has Himself given Me commandment what I should say and what I should speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak&#8221; (12:49-50).<h2 class=head2>Seeking the Father&#8217;s Glory</h2><p>The Son seeks the Father&#8217;s glory. John 7:18 says, &#8220;He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.&#8221; This verse proves that the Son does not seek His own glory, but seeks the glory of the Father. The Son&#8217;s will is the Father&#8217;s will, the Son&#8217;s work is the Father&#8217;s work, the Son&#8217;s word is the Father&#8217;s word, and the Son&#8217;s glory is the Father&#8217;s glory. The Son has nothing of Himself. All that the Son has is from the Father. The Son and the Father truly are one.<h2 class=head2>Expressing the Father</h2><p>The Son does not express Himself; instead, He expresses the Father. The Son&#8217;s expression is the Father&#8217;s expression. Hence, when we see the Son, we see the Father. This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip. In John 14:7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also. Then He said, &#8220;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&#8221; However, Philip replied, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&#8221; (v. 8). To this, the Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&#8221; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father.<h2 class=head2>Sending the Spirit from with the Father</h2><p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Son sends the Spirit from with the Father. In John 15:26 the Lord speaks of the Comforter, whom He &#8220;will send to you from with the Father&#8221; (lit). Then in 16:7 He goes on to say, &#8220;For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.&#8221; These verses indicate that the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father. Actually, this means that the Son sent Himself, because the Son is in the Father, and the Spirit comes from with the Father. Eventually, the One who is sent by the Son from the Father is actually the Son Himself.<h2 class=head2>Giving the Spirit to Us</h2><p>The Son also gives the Spirit to us. According to John 3:34b, &#8220;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; The Spirit is from with the Father, and the Son is in the Father. Whatever the Son gives is the Son Himself. Therefore, the Spirit given by the Son is actually the Son Himself.<h2 class=head2>Becoming the Spirit through Death and Resurrection</h2><p>The Son became the Spirit through death and resurrection. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of His resurrection, Christ breathed on His disciples and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). We may say that Christ already was the Spirit when He was in the flesh. The difference here is that His flesh was a covering comparable to a shell. Through death and resurrection, the opaque shell of the flesh became transparent. Therefore, now we can see that the Lord is the Spirit. Through death and resurrection, the last Adam in the opaque shell of the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. This is still the same Jesus, but now the shell is transparent. Hence, the One who was with the disciples is the same One who is now the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Abiding in Us as the Spirit with the Father</h2><p>After becoming the Spirit, the Lord abides in us as the Spirit with the Father (John 14:16-20; 17:23, 26). Do you know who abides in you? The Son abides in you as the Spirit with the Father. The Son sends the Spirit, and then the Son comes with the Spirit. Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Son comes. Furthermore, when the Son comes, the Father also comes. This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit- come. Therefore, now the Son abides in us as the Spirit with the Father. This is for the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:16-24</h1><p>In the two foregoing messages we began to consider the fourth sign found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the divine Trinity. We have seen that the divine Trinity is for the dispensing of the Triune God. We have covered ten matters related to the Father and seventeen matters related to the Son. Beginning with this message, we shall consider a number of matters related to the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The One Who Enters In, the Applier</h2><p>In the divine Trinity, the Father is the source, and the Son is the expression. Now we need to see that the Spirit is the entering in of the Triune God, the Applier. The Father plans, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies. Hence, the Father is the Planner, the Son is the Accomplisher, and the Spirit is the Applier. The Son has accomplished all that the Father has planned. Now the Spirit comes to apply all the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished. Here we see the Three of the Triune God working together. The Planner is the source, the Accomplisher is the expression, and the Applier is the One who enters into us. When the Spirit as the Applier enters into us, He brings with Him whatever the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished. This is the working of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-to dispense Himself and all that He has planned and accomplished, and is now applying, into our being.<p>One verse in the Gospel of John that speaks of the entering in to us of the Spirit is 14:17; &#8220;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; This verse speaks concerning the indwelling of the Spirit. Here we have the first mention of the indwelling Spirit, a matter that is fully developed in the Epistles (1 Cor. 6:19; Rom. 8:9, 11). John 20:22 also indicates that the Spirit enters into us: &#8220;And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we have the receiving of the Spirit promised in 14:17. The Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.<p>I hope that we shall not only learn all the matters we have been covering concerning the Trinity, but also experience them and minister them to others. I am especially thankful that the young people have the opportunity to learn these matters. I encourage all the saints to put the things you have heard into daily practice. This means that we need to apply them in our daily living. If we apply these matters daily, we shall possess them as our life supply. Then it will be easy for us to minister these truths to others. This will further the spreading of the Lord&#8217;s recovery; it will enable the circle of the recovery to expand. The Lord&#8217;s recovery will spread by the saints&#8217; living of all the things they have seen.<p>We have the Applier within us, and day by day He is applying all that has been planned by the Father and accomplished by the Son. The more we practice these matters and live them, the more opportunity we give to the Spirit to apply them to us. Therefore, we need to continue practicing in our daily life.<h2 class=head3>The Consummation of the Triune God</h2><p>If we read John 14:16-24 carefully, we shall see that the Spirit is the ultimate Person of the Triune God. In other words, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. I use the words &#8220;ultimate&#8221; and &#8220;consummation&#8221; to refer to the Spirit&#8217;s being the entering into us of the Triune God. We have seen that the Father dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). Then the Son came as the expression of the Father, the expression of the unapproachable and invisible God (John 1:18). Although the Son came as the expression of the Father, this was not the ultimate, the consummate, coming of the Triune God. After the Son came to express the Father, the Spirit comes as the realization of the Son.<h2 class=head3>Source, Expression, Realization</h2><p>Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are using three crucial words: source, expression, and realization. The source is the Father, and the Son is the expression of the Father as the source. Furthermore, the Spirit is the realization of the Son as the Father&#8217;s expression, and this realization is ultimate, consummate. The consummation of the Triune God is not solely the Spirit; this consummation is the Spirit as the realization of the Son, who is the expression of the Father as the source. Therefore, here we have the realization, the expression, and the source.<p>Neither the Father as the source nor the Son as the expression can reach us in an ultimate way. As the source, the Father cannot reach us at all. As the expression of the Father, the Son can reach us in an objective way, but He cannot reach us in a subjective way. To say that the Son cannot reach us in a subjective way means that He can be among us or with us but not in us, apart from the Spirit. In order for the Son as the expression of the Father to reach us subjectively, that is, to enter into us to dwell in us, there is the need of the Spirit. As the realization of the Son, the Spirit enters into us to be experienced, enjoyed, and possessed by us. Furthermore, the Spirit as the realization of the Son becomes one with us in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the entering in of the Triune God into us.<p>When the Spirit enters into us, the Son comes with the Spirit, and the Father comes in the Son. This means that when the Spirit as the realization reaches us, enters into us, and becomes one with us in our spirit, the entire Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is in us. When the realization, the Spirit, becomes our portion and enjoyment, we also have the source, the Father, and the expression, the Son. Along with the realization, both the source and the expression are in us. Therefore, once we possess the Spirit as the realization, we also possess the Son as the expression and the Father as the source. In other words, if we have the Spirit, we have all Three of the Triune God- the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The entire Triune God dwells within us.<p>By the Lord&#8217;s mercy I can testify that daily I experience the realization of the Triune God. Daily and hourly I have the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Spirit as the realization. I enjoy the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, and I experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into me. Day by day the Triune God is dispensed into me for my experience and enjoyment. As a result, my daily life is the realization of the Triune God, and this realization is the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, the all-inclusive Spirit is the full realization of the Triune God.<h2 class=head3>For Dispensing and Mingling</h2><p>We are not only being filled with the Triune God; we are also immersed into Him. For us to be filled with Him means that He is within us; for us to be immersed into Him means that we are in Him. This is the real mingling with the Triune God. Continually the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, and we are being immersed into Him in order to be mingled with Him.<p>As He mingles Himself with us, simultaneously He makes us one unit with Him. In this way He makes us an abode of the Father&#8217;s house. All the abodes of the Father&#8217;s house are branches of the universal vine revealed in John 15. Hence, the vine is the Father&#8217;s house, and the branches of the vine are the abodes of the Father&#8217;s house. If we realize this, we should say, &#8220;Hallelujah, I am one of the abodes of the Father&#8217;s house and one of the branches in the vine!&#8221;<p>What makes it possible for us to be abodes of the Father&#8217;s house and branches in the vine? This is not possible by what we are naturally, by what we are in our natural being. We can become abodes of the Father&#8217;s house and branches of the universal vine only by being mingled with the Triune God. We need the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God to fill us and saturate us, and we need to be immersed in this Spirit. Then the Spirit will be one with us, and we shall be one with the Spirit. In this way, our regenerated being and the Spirit become one entity, and this entity is an abode of the Father&#8217;s house and a branch in the universal vine. As those who have the Triune God in them, we become abodes of the Father&#8217;s house and branches in the vine. How wonderful! We become abodes and branches through the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.<p>Do not take this message on the Spirit merely as a doctrine. As you are reading this message, you need to consider it in the light of your experience. According to your experience, is not the Christian life a life of having the Triune God dispensed into us and mingling Himself with us? While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us. I can testify that sometimes this experience of the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us makes us beside ourselves with joy. Through this dispensing and mingling we may be so happy in the Lord that we may momentarily forget where we are and who we are. It may seem that we are not on earth but in the heavens. Every Christian should have this kind of experience in the Triune God. If you have never experienced the Triune God in this way, your experience as a Christian is below normal, below the standard.<p>When we experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us, we realize that in Him we are excellent, wonderful persons. A married sister who experiences the Triune God in this way will be an excellent wife, and a married brother with this enjoyment will be an excellent husband. How marvelous it is to experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us! It may seem to some that this is a dream. If this is a dream, then I would say that all Christians need such a dream. If you have never experienced this dream, you may be a religious Christian, but you are not a Christian according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. In other words, in your experience you do not have the dispensing and the mingling of the Triune God. We can testify that this experience of the Triune God makes us God-men, persons filled with the Triune God and immersed in Him.<p>Chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John reveal the Triune God. According to these chapters, the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes to us and enters into us. When the Spirit enters into us, we experience the dispensing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and also the mingling with the Triune God.<p>There are times when the experience of the dispensing of the Triune God and of being mingled with Him should cause us to be beside ourselves with joy. We should not remain serious and sober in a natural way, but we should have the wonderful enjoyment of the Triune God. Those who in their experience know what it means to be beside themselves with joy because of the dispensing of the Triune God into them cause me to be very happy and encouraged concerning the future of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. I am especially happy to see young people filled with the Lord and enjoying Him. Oh, let us all enjoy the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and being mingled with us! This dispensing and mingling will bring us into an ecstasy in Him. It will take us out of ourselves and cause us to be full of joy in the Lord. Using electricity as an illustration, we may also say that the more we experience the dispensing of the Triune God and are mingled with Him, the more we shall be &#8220;electrified,&#8221; the more we shall be &#8220;charged&#8221; with divine electricity, which is the Triune God transmitted into our being.<h2 class=head2>Another Paraclete</h2><p>The Spirit is also another Paraclete. Concerning this, John 14:16 says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; This Comforter is the Spirit of reality (v. 17). Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word parakletos, which denotes one alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. The same Greek word is rendered &#8220;Advocate&#8221; in 1 John 2:1. Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete, taking care of our case. The Spirit as the reality of Jesus ministers to us and takes care of all of our needs.<h2 class=head2>Receiving All That Is of the Son, Thus Becoming the Son&#8217;s Transfiguration</h2><p>The Spirit receives all that is of the Son and thereby becomes the Son&#8217;s transfiguration. This is revealed in John 16:14 and 15: &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; These verses indicate that the Father has given all that He has to the Son and that the Spirit shall receive what is the Son&#8217;s and disclose it to the disciples. Because the Father has given everything He has to the Son, the Son is His embodiment. Now whatever the Son is has been passed on to the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. We have the transfiguration and also the embodiment. This means that when we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. We have all Three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:16-24, 26; 15:26; 16:7</h1><p>In the three foregoing messages we have been considering the sign of the divine Trinity. We have covered a number of points related to the Father and the Son, and three matters related to the Spirit. In this message we shall continue to consider additional matters related to the Spirit and then go on to the next sign, the sign of another Paraclete.<h2 class=head2>Sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s Name</h2><p>John 14:26 says, &#8220;But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.&#8221; Here we see that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. According to 5:43, the Son came in the Father&#8217;s name: &#8220;I have come in the name of My Father.&#8221; For the Son to come in the name of the Father means that the Son comes as the Father.<p>Suppose brother A sends brother B to carry out a certain business matter in the name of brother A. In such a case, brother B comes in the name of brother A. Because brother A sends brother B in his name, brother B does not come in his own name, but comes in the name of brother A. This means that, in a very practical way, brother B comes as brother A. If we understand this illustration, then we can understand why according to Isaiah 9:6 the Son given to us is called the Father. This verse indicates that the Son comes in the Father&#8217;s name. He is the Son, but He is called the Father, for He comes in the Father&#8217;s name and thereby comes as the Father. Simply, this means that the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30).<p>The principle is the same with the Father&#8217;s sending the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. According to 14:26, the Father sends the Spirit, but He sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. Therefore, the Spirit comes in the Son&#8217;s name because the Spirit and the Son are one (2 Cor. 3:17).<p>As an illustration, let us suppose that brother A sends brother C in the name of brother B. If he were asked to identify himself, brother C could say, &#8220;I am brother C coming in the name of brother B and sent by brother A.&#8221; In a similar way the Spirit could say of Himself, &#8220;I am the Spirit coming in the name of the Son and sent by the Father.&#8221;<p>In 14:26 we have the Three of the divine Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. According to this verse, the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. Therefore, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son come with Him. We have seen that because the Son comes in the name of the Father, the Son is called the Father. Because the Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name, so the Spirit comes in the name of the Son with the Father. This means that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.<p>Just as the Son does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Father, so the Spirit does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Son. This means that although the Spirit is here, He is not here in His own name, but in the Son&#8217;s name. Furthermore, the Son is here in the Father&#8217;s name, not in His own name. Therefore, when the Spirit is here, the Son is here, and when the Son is here, the Father is here. This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-come with the Spirit.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that the Father cannot reach us directly. The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. When the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us. This is the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. Therefore, when the Spirit comes into us, we have the Triune God entering into us. We have the Father as the source, we have the Son as the expression, and we have the Spirit as the One entering into us. Hallelujah for the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name!<h2 class=head2>Given by the Father in Answer to the Son&#8217;s Request</h2><p>The Father gives the Spirit in answer to the Son&#8217;s request. This is according to the Lord&#8217;s word in John 14:16: &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; This indicates that the Father sends the Spirit at the request of the Son. Once again we see that the Spirit&#8217;s coming is a matter of the coming of the Three of the divine Trinity. This is indicated by the fact that the Spirit is given by the Father in answer to the request of the Son.<p>We wish to emphasize the fact that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes. The reason for this is that the Spirit, the Son, and the Father cannot be separated. Actually, in our experience of the divine dispensing, the Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father. This understanding may be contrary to religious tradition and systematic theology, but it definitely is according to the pure Word of God.<p>I encourage you to study chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John in the light of the ten points we have given concerning the Father, the seventeen points we have given concerning the Son, and the total of eleven points we shall give concerning the Spirit. All these points will help you to know the Trinity as revealed in these four chapters of John&#8217;s Gospel.<h2 class=head2>Proceeding from with the Father</h2><p>According to John 15:26, the Spirit proceeds from with the Father: &#8220;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; The sense in Greek of the word translated &#8220;from&#8221; is from with. The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father, but also from with the Father. The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. For the Spirit to come from the source does not mean that He leaves the source; it means that the source comes with Him. When the Spirit comes, the Father also comes.<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit cannot be separated, because all Three are one. We do not have language adequate to describe this fact. Nevertheless, it is a divine fact that the Father, Son, and the Spirit are one.<h2 class=head2>To Abide with the Son and the Father in Us</h2><p>The Spirit abides in us with the Son and the Father. When the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come. When the Spirit abides in us, both the Son and the Father abide in us with the Spirit. As John 14:17 makes clear, the Spirit of reality abides in us. When we compare this verse with John 14:23, we see that the Father and the Son also abide in us. Therefore the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-abides in us. Furthermore, Romans 8:9-11 also indicates that the Spirit abides in us with the Son and the Father.<p>When we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit moves within our spirit. Because the Father and the Son abide in our spirit with the Spirit, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us. When we call on the Lord Jesus, we may have the sense that the Triune God is abiding in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>To Testify concerning the Son and Glorify Him</h2><p>The Spirit also testifies concerning the Son and glorifies Him. John 15:26 says, &#8220;The Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; Since the Spirit is sent by the Son and comes with the Father, the Spirit&#8217;s testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God. John 16:14 says that the Spirit will glorify the Son: &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; The Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him with all the fullness of the Father. This means that the Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him to us.<h2 class=head2>To Overflow from within the Believers</h2><p>John 7:38-39 reveals that the Spirit will overflow from within the believers: &#8220;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.&#8221; In John 4:14 the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life. In chapter seven the Lord goes further and says that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life. In verse 38 the Lord Jesus does not speak of one flow; He speaks of rivers. The unique river of living water is the Holy Spirit. Out of this unique river many rivers will flow out. These rivers of living water are the many flowings of the different aspects of life, of the one river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God&#8217;s Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). This is the Spirit overflowing from within the believers.<h2 class=head2>The Seven Spirits before the Throne of God as the Seven Eyes of the Lamb, the Son</h2><p>In the book of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God as the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). The fact that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son, proves that the Son and the Spirit are not separate.<p>According to the traditional concept, the Spirit is separate from the Son. But according to the book of Revelation, the Spirit is the eyes of the Son. Are, then, the Spirit and the Son one or two? The book of Revelation indicates clearly that the seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ, the Son. This means that the so-called Third of the Trinity is the eyes of the Second. Then how could the eyes of the Second be regarded as a separate person from the Second? Can a person&#8217;s eyes be regarded as a separate person apart from him? This is impossible! In resurrection Christ has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, the two, Christ and the Spirit are one (2 Cor. 3:17). We may say that Christ and the Spirit are distinct, but we may not say that They are separate. Concerning this matter, we simply teach what the Bible says. The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the wonderful Lamb!<h2 class=head2>One with the Bride, God&#8217;s Redeemed</h2><p>The Spirit is one with the bride, God&#8217;s redeemed. Revelation 22:17a indicates this: &#8220;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; The fact that the Spirit and the bride speak together reveals that the Spirit is one with the bride. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the bride is the consummation of God&#8217;s redeemed people. In Revelation the consummation of the Triune God marries the consummation of God&#8217;s redeemed people to form a universal couple. In Revelation 22:17 we see a divine-human marriage. The Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, is the Husband, and the consummation of God&#8217;s redeemed people is the bride. Because the Spirit and the bride are one, they speak as one. How marvelous!<h2 class=head2>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being the One God, and the Entire God Being the Spirit</h2><p>Regarding the divine Trinity, we would also point out that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the one God. First Peter 1:2 reveals that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8, that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4, that the Spirit is God. Moreover, according to John 4:24, the entire God is the Spirit. To say that God is Spirit means that Spirit is the nature, the substance, of the Triune God. For example, just as the substance of a wooden table is wood, the substance of God is Spirit. Hallelujah, our God, the Triune God, is Spirit!<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF ANOTHER PARACLETE</h2><p>Thus far, we have covered four signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Father&#8217;s house, the sign of the Son&#8217;s going and coming, the sign of the way, the reality, and the life, and the sign of the divine Trinity. Let us now proceed to the fifth sign, the sign of another Paraclete (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7).<p>In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;Comforter&#8221; here is parakletos. Paraclete is the anglicized form of this Greek word. This word is a figure; hence, it also is a sign.<p>In Greek, parakletos denotes someone alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. It is composed of two words: a preposition that means with and a form of the word for call. In ancient times a paraclete was a helper, advocate, counsel, or intercessor. A paraclete was someone who served a particular person by taking care of his needs. As one who is always present, a paraclete may be considered a waiter, a helper, and also an attorney. In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was &#8220;one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him.&#8221; In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a &#8220;patron&#8221; with the Father. Then in a note he explains that he uses the word patron in the sense of the Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. We may say that the Spirit today is our Patron. He is with us to take care of our entire situation.<h2 class=head2>One Called to Another&#8217;s Side to Help Him</h2><p>The Paraclete signifies one called to another&#8217;s side to help him. Hence, the Paraclete is a Helper. The Spirit as another Paraclete is always available to help us.<h2 class=head2>One Offering Legal Aid or One Interceding on Behalf of Someone Else</h2><p>The Paraclete also signifies one offering legal aid or one interceding on behalf of someone else; hence, the Spirit as another Paraclete is an Advocate, a Counsel, or an Intercessor. We may say that this Paraclete is our divine Attorney, who counsels us in relation to our need.<h2 class=head2>For Consoling</h2><p>The Paraclete is also one who consoles us. He is the Consoler, the Comforter. How marvelous that the Spirit always consoles and comforts us!<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Reality</h2><p>The Spirit as another Paraclete is the Spirit of reality. When we compare John 14:16 and 17, it is clear that this Paraclete, this Comforter, is the Spirit of reality. John 15:26 also indicates that the Comforter is the Spirit of reality. Furthermore in John 16:13 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&#8221; In addition, according to 1 John 5:6, the Spirit is the truth, the reality.<p>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God and of the Son. The Spirit is the reality of every divine thing, and, as such, He is the reality of eternal life. Eventually, because He is the reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life. Without the Spirit of reality, eternal life would be empty, vain. Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of God, of the Son, of eternal life, and of every divine matter. Therefore, He is called the Spirit of reality.<h2 class=head3>Coming through the Son&#8217;s Death and Resurrection</h2><p>John 16:7 indicates that the Spirit of reality comes through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection: &#8220;I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.&#8221; As we have pointed out, in these chapters of the Gospel of John, the Lord uses His going to denote His death. The Son came through incarnation, but the Spirit comes through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection.<h2 class=head3>Receiving All That Is of the Son to Disclose It to the Believers</h2><p>The Spirit of reality receives all that is of the Son in order to disclose it to the believers. Regarding this, the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you&#8221; (John 16:14-15). All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit of reality reveals to the believers all that the Son is. This means that our understanding of the Son is by the Spirit, who has received whatever the Son is and then reveals this to us.<h2 class=head3>To Testify concerning the Son and to Glorify Him</h2><p>We have already pointed out that the Spirit testifies concerning the Son and glorifies Him (John 15:26; 16:14). Now we would point out that, in particular, this is a function of the Spirit of reality, who comes through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection. Because the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son and glorifies the Son, we know the Son through Him.<h2 class=head3>To Guide the Believers into All the Reality</h2><p>In John 16:13 we see that the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality: &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&#8221; The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters. The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things. He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.<h2 class=head3>To Convict the World concerning Sin, Righteousness, and Judgment</h2><p>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment: &#8220;And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&#8221; The Spirit always convicts the world, that is, mankind, concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin (John 8:44). We were born of sin in Adam. To be freed from sin, the only way is to believe in Christ the Son of God. If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41).<p>In 16:8-11, the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan. We all became fallen in Adam. But we may believe in Christ and be justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of sin, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&#8217;s death (Heb. 2:14). The three main items in these three verses are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness. All those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan. Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan. Hallelujah, we have believed in Christ, and we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ! No longer are we followers of Satan, and our destiny certainly will not be the same as his.<p>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. We also became children of God and members of Christ. Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2, 23; 15:4a, 5a</h1><p>In the three foregoing messages we covered the signs of the divine Trinity and of another Comforter. Concerning the divine Trinity, we covered forty-seven points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the consummation. We may also say that the Father is the Originator, the Son is the Accomplisher, and the Spirit is the Applier. In addition, we have the full realization of the Triune God. Therefore, we have seven important terms: source, expression, consummation, Originator, Accomplisher, Applier, and realization.<h2 class=head1>THE TWOFOLDNESS OF DIVINE TRUTH</h2><p>Before we go on to consider the fifth sign, the sign of the abode, I would like to say a word concerning the twofoldness of divine truth. With all biblical truths there is the matter of twofoldness; that is, with each truth there are two aspects. Even with God we can see twofoldness. On the one hand, God is one; on the other hand He is three. Hence, God is triune, three-one.<p>God is divine, spiritual, and mysterious. Nevertheless, with God there is a physical aspect. Even though He is spiritual, yet there is a physical aspect with Him. The Gospel of John emphasizes the spiritual and divine aspects of God. But in the book of Acts we can see the physical aspect of the Trinity. As far as the spiritual aspect is concerned, Christ today dwells within us. He lives in us in a mysterious way. Although the indwelling of Christ is a mystery, it is nonetheless a reality. We all can testify that we have the Son of God living in us. However, according to the book of Acts, Christ has ascended to the heavens in a physical way (Acts 1:9). His ascension was a physical event, and this event was seen by His disciples in a physical way. They saw the Lord Jesus literally ascending to the heavens. What they beheld was not a phantom, but a man with a solid, physical body. This is clearly portrayed in chapter one of Acts. Furthermore, according to Acts 3:21, Christ must remain in the heavens until the millennium, the time of restitution: &#8220;Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.&#8221; Therefore, physically speaking, Christ is no longer on earth, but in the heavens. Nevertheless, spiritually speaking, Christ dwells within us. Here we have two aspects-the spiritual aspect and the physical aspect.<p>When you speak to others about the Triune God dwelling in you, they may respond by pointing out that according to Acts 1 the Lord Jesus has ascended to the heavens and that according to Acts 3 He must remain there until the times of the restitution of all things. Then they may warn you not to listen to anyone who teaches you that the Triune God abides in you. If you encounter such a situation, you may say, &#8220;I certainly believe what is written concerning the Lord in Acts 1 and 3. However, I would remind you that the Gospel of John comes before the book of Acts. Let us study chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel and see what these chapters reveal concerning the Triune God. In particular, I would like to point out how in these chapters we have the source, the expression, the consummation, the Originator, the Accomplisher, the Applier, and the realization.&#8221; This is the way to fight for the truth. In fighting for the truth, we do not trust fleshly weapons. Instead, our trust is in the pure Word of God.<p>When we face opposition to a particular biblical truth, we need to remember the twofoldness of divine truth. Even our constitution as human beings is an illustration of the twofoldness of truth, for we have a physical part and also a psychological and spiritual part. Medical doctors may study our physical body, but they may not know much about our psychological part and virtually nothing about our spirit. This illustration indicates that it is not sufficient to know any truth in only one aspect. Even the paper on which this message is printed has two sides.<p>Nothing can exist with only one side. For example, we have both day and night. If we had day without night, I doubt that any living thing could exist. In order for life to exist on earth, there is the need for both day and night. This simple illustration points to the fact that there are always two aspects of the truth. For instance, God is one and three, three-one. The Spirit of God is one and also seven (Rev. 1:4). Therefore, let us learn to study the twofoldness of the divine truth.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE ABODE</h2><p>Let us now go on to consider the fifth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John-the sign of the abode. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; A crucial word in this verse is &#8220;abode.&#8221; In 15:4a, the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; In the next verse He once again uses the word &#8220;abides.&#8221; In these verses the crucial word is &#8220;abide.&#8221; In Greek the words for abode and abide have the same root. The difference, of course, between them is that one is a noun and the other is a verb. Since the word &#8220;abode&#8221; is a sign, we need to see the significance of the sign of the abode.<p>In 14:23 the Lord indicates that if we love Him, we shall keep His word. Then the Father will love us, and the Father and the Son will make an abode with us. Why does this verse first speak of our loving the Lord and then of the Father, not the Son, loving us? The reason is that the Father and the Son are one. When we love the Son, the Father responds because the Son comes with the Father and in the name of the Father. Because the Son comes with the Father and in the Father&#8217;s name, when we love the Son, we love the Father. For this reason, the Father responds by returning love to us. We love the Son, the Father loves us, and the result is that both the Father and the Son come to us and make an abode with us.<p>The word &#8220;abode&#8221; in verse 23 may be so familiar to us that we take it for granted and do not pay attention to it. I would suggest that you circle this word in your Bible. The abode in 14:23 is a very important sign, a sign rich in significance.<h2 class=head1>BECOMING GOD&#8217;S DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>What does the abode signify? First, the abode signifies that it is possible for human beings to become an abode of God. What a great matter this is! We human beings can become God&#8217;s dwelling place!<p>Many times when we read the Bible, our natural, human thoughts are veils that keep us from seeing the truth in the Word. Because of these veils, someone may read chapter fourteen of the Gospel of John ten times and still not pay attention to the crucial word &#8220;abode&#8221; in verse 23. This word is a key that opens the entire chapter.<p>This chapter reveals that we human beings can be and should be God&#8217;s dwelling place. This thought corresponds to the fact that God created man to be a vessel to contain Himself. A vessel is different from an instrument, for a vessel is designed to contain something. As a vessel made by God, man was created to contain God. Such a container is also a dwelling place. All those who dwell in a house, for example, are contained in that house. Hence, a house is a vessel, and a vessel is a house, a dwelling place. Because we were created vessels to contain God, He regards us all as His abodes.<p>Due to the fall, man went away from God. But through Jesus Christ we have been brought back to God. Now the Lord seeks to stir up our love for Him. God is happy when we love the Lord Jesus. Then both the Father and the Son come to the one who loves the Son, settle themselves within him, and make their abode with him.<p>We have seen that man was created by God as a vessel to contain God. Because man fell away from God, the Lord Jesus came to save us, redeem us, and bring us back to God. He stirs up our love, and in response we may say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I love You.&#8221; The Father responds to our love for the Son, and then the Father and the Son come to us to make an abode in our spirit. Actually, the Father and the Son come to take us over, to possess us. It is in this way that the Father and the Son settle within us to make an abode with us. This is a great matter!<p>It is not the goal of God&#8217;s redemption simply to save us from hell to heaven. Neither is it God&#8217;s goal in His redemption merely to make us better. The goal of God&#8217;s redemption is to make us His dwelling place. His goal in saving us is to make us an abode for Him so that He may fully settle Himself in our being. By this we see that God desires to dwell in us. Therefore, the first matter signified by the abode in chapter fourteen is that we human beings may become God&#8217;s dwelling place. Oh, God desires, longs, to enter into us, possess us, and make us His dwelling place!<h2 class=head1>BECOMING ONE WITH GOD</h2><p>The abode in 14:23 also signifies that we and God become one. When you fully settle down in your house, the house becomes one with you, and you become one with the house. This oneness of the house and those dwelling in the house is indicated by the fact that the Greek word for house, oikos, denotes both a house and a household. Actually, a house and a household should be one. The house is a building, and the household is a family. Therefore, the family and the building should be one. According to the biblical thought, the house should be the household, and the household should be the house.<p>If a household, a family, does not have a house, they will find it difficult to live as a family. What kind of family has no house to live in? Such a family may have a life like gypsies. On the other hand, what kind of house has no one dwelling in it? Such a house would be empty. Therefore, a family needs a house, and a house needs a family. The Bible regards a household and a house as one.<p>According to the New Testament, we are God&#8217;s house, and the family, the household, is composed of the Triune God with His children. Therefore, the family is the Triune God and we, the believers. However, this raises a question: how can we be the family as well as the house? To God, the family is the house. Hence, we are the family and the family is the house; therefore, we are the house. Nevertheless, a question still remains: Does not the family include God? If so, must God then also be the house? Yes, it is correct to say that God is also the house. Eventually, we and God are both the family and the house.<p>The reason we and God can be both the family and the house is that we are mingled with the Triune God. The mingling of divinity with humanity is the abode in 14:23. By this we see that the abode here is not a simple matter. The abode is a sign signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity, a mingling that is both the house and the household.<p>We should not understand the Bible, especially a chapter like John 14, in a superficial way. Rather, we need to delve into the depths of the Word. The depths of the truth of the abode in John 14 are related to the fact that the abode is a matter of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-mingling Himself with His redeemed people to make Himself one with them. This oneness is the house and the household. This is the abode.<h2 class=head1>A PNEUMATIC ORGANISM</h2><p>The abode we have just described is the proper and real church, the corporate Body of Christ. This Body is the abode, and this abode is the oneness of the Triune God and His redeemed people. We may also say that this mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people is the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).<p>In His recovery the Lord is not recovering anything religious. On the contrary, He is recovering the living divine Person in a corporate sense. This involves the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to make them the abode, the house of God, the church, the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem.<p>This abode is not a lifeless organization; it is a living, pneumatic organism, an organism full of pneuma, full of the Spirit, the divine breath. The church in your locality should be such an organism. If we see this, we shall realize that the genuine church is different from organized Christianity with its forms, rituals, and regulations. We do not want a religion; we want a living, pneumatic abode full of the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US</h2><p>For the producing of this abode, Christ has redeemed us. Then the Spirit stirs up within us a love for our Redeemer. The Father, happy with our love for the Son, responds to our love by loving us. We can testify that when we love the Lord Jesus, we have the sense deep within us that our Father is happy and pleased with us. Spontaneously, we also have the sense that two wonderful divine Visitors, two divine Guests-the Father and the Son-have come to stay with us.<p>You may wonder why there is no mention of the Spirit in 14:23. This verse says only that the Father and the Son come to us to make an abode with us. But do you think that the pronoun &#8220;We&#8221; here includes only the Father and the Son but not the Spirit? To be sure, the Spirit must be included. We may say that the Father and the Son are the Guests and that the Spirit is the Guide, the Usher. Apart from the Spirit, the Father and the Son would not have a way to enter into us and be settled in us. The Spirit ushers the Son and the Father into their dwelling place within us. Therefore, eventually we have two marvelous Guests with one dear Guide making Their home in us; that is, we have the Father and the Son with the Spirit indwelling us.<p>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the Spirit is the Paraclete. He is our Patron and Attorney, and even our Interpreter. As the Interpreter, He makes it easier for us to &#8220;converse&#8221; with the Father and the Son. The Son was the first Paraclete, and now the Spirit is another Paraclete. Through this One, another Paraclete, everything concerning the Father and the Son is made understandable. Hallelujah, we have the Father and the Son with the Spirit as the wonderful Guide! This means that we have the Triune God dwelling in us, mingling Himself with us, and making Himself one with us, and this oneness is the abode.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:1-16:4</h1><h2 class=head1>A SIGN OF CHRIST&#8217;S UNIVERSAL SPREADING</h2><p>In this message we come to the sixth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John-the sign of the true vine. This sign is related to the spreading of the vine. Whereas most trees grow vertically, a vine spreads by growing horizontally. For example, a cedar tree shoots upward into the sky, but a vine grows along the surface of the earth. Hence, the growth of the vine is a matter of its spreading to cover the earth. In chapter fifteen of John&#8217;s Gospel we do not have a cedar tree; we have a vine tree spreading on earth.<p>While visiting London in 1958, I was taken by a friend to see the Queen&#8217;s Vine, which is housed in a large glass room. My friend boasted to me concerning this vine and asked what I thought of it. I answered, &#8220;This vine is not a surprise to me, for I have seen a much greater vine. The Queen&#8217;s Vine is rather small, and the greenhouse in which it is located is not very large. But the vine I have seen is so vast, so immense, that it covers the entire globe. Have you seen this vine?&#8221;<p>Of course, the vine I was referring to is the true vine, the vine revealed in John 15. In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the true vine.&#8221; Only Christ is the true vine. Any other vine is false. As the true vine, the Lord is permanent, but other vines, including the Queen&#8217;s Vine, are temporary. There is on earth one vine that is permanent, and this vine is Christ. Christ is the universal vine spreading over the whole earth.<p>Unbelievers may think that we are dreaming when we say that Christ is the universal vine covering the earth. But this is not a dream. Today there are millions of Christians around the world. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was restricted to traveling in a small area. But now Christ has spread throughout the world. Can you name a country to which Christ as the universal vine has not spread? Wherever we may go we can see the spreading of the universal vine.<p>In John 15:1 the Lord says, &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&#8221; This true vine, which is the Son, with its branches, which are the believers in the Son, is the organism of the Triune God in God&#8217;s economy to grow with His riches and express His life. Christ Himself is the true vine, and the Father is the Husbandman, the Farmer who cultivates the soil so that the vine may spread.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we have seen the spreading of this vine to the uttermost parts of the earth. For example, when I visited Germany in 1958 and stayed in Hamburg, I did not meet a single Christian. But now, twenty-five years later, there are a number of churches in Germany. What a spreading of the vine has taken place in Germany!<p>The vine in chapter fifteen is a sign of Christ&#8217;s universal spreading. The abode, the dwelling, is a sign of the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen people. But the vine tree is a sign of universal spreading. It is foolish for politicians and statesmen to think that Christians can be terminated. Those who persecute the believers in Christ do not realize that the more the believers are terminated, the more the Christians, all of whom are branches in the vine, will carry out the universal spreading of the true vine.<p>We have pointed out that the true vine is the organism of the Triune God. The Son Himself is the vine, the Father is the Husbandman, and the Spirit is the Testifier. In the very chapter that reveals the universal vine, we have a word concerning the Spirit as the Testifier: &#8220;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me&#8221; (v. 26). Therefore, in John 15 the vine is growing, the Husbandman is cultivating, and the Spirit is testifying.<p>In relation to the true vine, the organism of the Triune God, what does it mean that the Spirit is the Testifier? Doctrinally we may not be able to understand this, but experientially we do know what it means for the Spirit to be the Testifier. When we see the spreading of the vine, the Spirit within us says, &#8220;Amen! That&#8217;s it!&#8221; Many have testified that the Spirit within them responded in such a way when they first came in contact with the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This is the Spirit&#8217;s testifying within us concerning the spreading of the true vine.<h2 class=head1>THE VINE BEING THE FATHER&#8217;S HOUSE</h2><p>Having seen that the vine in John 15 is the organism of the Triune God, we need to go on to see that this vine, this organism, is the Father&#8217;s house (14:2). The Father&#8217;s house is the subject of chapter fourteen, and the vine is the subject of chapter fifteen. We know that chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen are one message given by the Lord in the night He was betrayed. Because the first part of this message is on the Father&#8217;s house and the next part is on the vine, it is certainly correct to say that the vine is a definition of the Father&#8217;s house. Would you like to know more about the Father&#8217;s house spoken of in chapter fourteen? If so, go on to chapter fifteen, where you will find a further definition and more information. Actually, the Father&#8217;s house is an organism, a spreading vine. Therefore, we should not regard the Father&#8217;s house as something physical and lifeless. No, the Father&#8217;s house is the vine, and the branches of this vine are the many abodes, the many rooms, of the Father&#8217;s house.<p>Have you seen that you are a branch in the universal vine and that the branches are rooms of the Father&#8217;s house? The vine has many branches, and the Father&#8217;s house has many rooms. Praise the Lord that the branches of the vine are the rooms of the house! We may say that we have become branches in order to be rooms. The room is a place for abiding, and the branch is for growing, for spreading.<p>The Greek word translated &#8220;abide&#8221; not only means to remain or stay, but also means to dwell. When the King James Version was translated, the English word &#8220;abide&#8221; had the meaning of dwell. However, in today&#8217;s English this word primarily means to stay or remain.<p>Ephesians 3:17 says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;make home&#8221; in this verse is a strengthened form, an intensified form, of the word for abide. The word in Ephesians 3:17 has the prefix kata, and the meaning of the word is somewhat similar to the English expression &#8220;settle down.&#8221; In this verse Paul speaks of Christ settling Himself down in our hearts. It seems that the best way to translate this Greek word here is to say that Christ is making His home in our hearts.<p>Christ not only dwells in us, but He desires to make His home in us. To make your home in a certain place means that you are settled there. For example, I may dwell in a brother&#8217;s home for a short period of time, but I do not make my home there. I have not settled down there. In John 14 and 15 we have the words &#8220;abodes&#8221; and &#8220;abide,&#8221; and in Ephesians 3 Paul prays that Christ may make His home in our hearts. He prays not only that Christ will dwell in us, but also that He will make His home in us.<p>Ephesians 2:22 says that in Christ we are &#8220;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;dwelling place&#8221; is the noun form of the verb &#8220;make home&#8221; in Ephesians 3:17. Furthermore, the word in 2:22 has the same prefix as that in 3:17. This prefix points to something deep, not something superficial. God has a habitation, a dwelling place in us, in a deep way, in a way that is settled down and even rooted downward. He has not only a habitation; He has a &#8220;settled-down habitation.&#8221;<p>These verses reveal that in the New Testament there is the crucial thought that God, the Creator, longs, desires, to make His home in us. His home is a matter of mingling, and this mingling is also a vine that is growing, spreading, and covering the entire earth. Today we are branches of this vine and abodes of the Father&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head1>THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FATHER IN FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p>With the vine we also have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is not the result of a deliberate practice; instead, fruit-bearing is organically natural.<p>The Gospel of John is unique in that it is concerned with divine things. By &#8220;divine things&#8221; we primarily mean God with His life, nature, and expression, which is His glory. Whereas the first three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-charge us to preach the gospel, we do not have such a charge in the Gospel of John. In this Gospel preaching is replaced by fruit-bearing. In 15:8 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&#8221; In fruit-bearing the Father&#8217;s life is expressed; hence, in fruit-bearing He is glorified.<p>Among today&#8217;s Christians, preaching the gospel in order to win souls is emphasized. It is true that we may win souls through the preaching of the gospel. However, we may not bear much fruit. Preaching the gospel may be merely an activity, a practice, or a movement. Life, on the contrary, is a matter of living, not a matter of activity or of a movement.<p>In the Gospel of John the preaching of the gospel is not an activity; it is a living. This living may be illustrated by a tree bearing fruit. When a tree brings forth fruit, the tree does not engage in any deliberate activity. Fruit-bearing is simply the issue of the tree&#8217;s living. There is no need to give a command to a peach tree to produce peaches. It would be foolish to say, &#8220;Peach tree, you must be faithful and diligent to produce peaches.&#8221; A peach tree produces fruit simply because it is a living organism. Only artificial fruit can be produced as a result of making requirements. If you need a thousand artificial peaches, you may require workers to produce them in a day. But it is unnecessary to require a living peach tree to bear fruit, and it would be useless to tell it to produce fruit overnight.<p>The Lord does not want us to produce artificial fruit. The Lord&#8217;s desire is that we bear fruit in the way of life. Concerning this, the Lord needs a genuine recovery. The Lord does not want a gospel-preaching movement. He wants genuine fruit-bearing.<p>I would not say that there is nothing of life in today&#8217;s gospel campaigns or movements. Nevertheless, the amount of life is limited. Of course, the Lord is merciful. Whenever His word is preached and whenever people call on His name, He will extend His mercy. For this reason, many are saved in gospel campaigns. However, this does not necessarily indicate that such a campaign or movement is truly according to the Lord&#8217;s way of life. What the Lord wants is that we have a living that results in fruit-bearing.<p>In John 15:1 the Lord says that He is the true vine and that the Father is the Husbandman. As the Husbandman, the Father cares for the vine. He waters the vine, cultivates the soil, and protects the vine from everything that would damage it. As John 15 indicates, the vine is not for a movement; the vine is for fruit-bearing.<p>The fruit-bearing of the vine is the glorification of the Father. The propagation or multiplication of the divine life through the vine is the glorification of the Father, that is, His expression. The Lord says that if we bear much fruit, the Father will be glorified (15:8). Hence, our fruit-bearing is the glorification of the Triune God.<p>Our fruit-bearing is the expression of the Triune God from within. Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature. The expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory. Therefore, when the divine life with its nature is expressed through us in fruit-bearing, the Father is glorified.<p>We may also use electricity as an illustration of glory. When the switch in a room is off, electricity is still present, but there is no expression of electricity in the shining of light. We may say that light equals glory. When the switch is turned on, electricity is expressed, and this expression is light, which is glory. Thus, the shining of light is the glorification of electricity.<p>The principle is the same with the glorification of the Father in fruit-bearing. We have the divine life within us, and now this life needs to be expressed. When the divine life is expressed in fruit-bearing, that expression is the glorification of this life.<p>As we shall see in forthcoming messages, in John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed concerning the glory which the Father had given Him and which He had given to His disciples. The glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to the disciples is the divine life with the divine nature for God&#8217;s expression. The Father has given His life and nature to the Son so that the Son may express the Father&#8217;s glory. This is the glory given by the Father to the Son. The Son has given us this divine life with its divine nature so that we also may express God in glory. In this message we are emphasizing the fact that in John 15 this expression of the divine life, this glorification of the Father, is in fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is a matter of our daily living. Day by day we need to live a life that bears fruit, and in this way we glorify the Father.<p>According to John 15, what does it mean to glorify the Father? To glorify the Father is to express the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing. Concerning this matter, we need to see that every life is after its own kind. An apple tree will produce apples and a peach tree will produce peaches because both an apple tree and a peach tree are after their own kind. There is no need to instruct an apple tree not to bear peaches or to warn a peach tree not to bear apples. A peach tree simply bears peaches, and an apple tree simply bears apples. This fruit-bearing comes from the life within the trees. The principle is the same with the fruit-bearing in John 15. The Lord&#8217;s way in fruit-bearing is the way of the propagation of life, the multiplication of life. As the divine life is multiplied, propagated, this life is expressed. Therefore, the fruit-bearing of the vine is the expression, the glorification, of the divine life in the vine.<p>If we see the vision concerning the spreading of the vine and the fruit-bearing of the vine, we shall realize that there is no need for us to strive in ourselves to preach the gospel. There is no need for our own activity. Instead of natural or religious activity, we simply need to live the divine life, and we shall bear fruit. As we live this life, those around us will realize that we are persons living the divine life. As a result, they will be attracted, convinced, and subdued. This life will shine upon them, and eventually the Lord Jesus will be imparted to them. In this way they will become fruit produced by our living.<p>The proper way, the way ordained by God, for new believers to be produced is through the imparting of life. Fruit-bearing, therefore, is a matter of imparting divine life to others so that they may be born of God. The more we express the divine life in fruit-bearing, the more the Father will be glorified.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(12)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 16:16-24</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the sign of the newborn child (16:16-24).<p>For many years I was bothered by this portion of the Gospel of John, especially by the Lord&#8217;s word in verse 21 concerning a man that is born into the world. I asked, &#8220;Who is this man? The Lord Jesus was to be put to death. How can a man be born?&#8221; I could not understand these verses. Furthermore, I thought that when the Lord told His disciples that they would see Him (vv. 16-17, 19, 22), He was referring to His second advent. I was also puzzled by the words &#8220;a little while&#8221; in verses 16 through 19. If this refers to the period of time between the Lord&#8217;s death and His coming back, it seemed to me that this length of time, which has lasted more than nineteen centuries, is not a &#8220;little while.&#8221; By this you can see that in the past I had a number of problems with this portion of the Word. Because I was eager to understand the Bible, especially the Gospel of John, these questions kept bothering me.<h2 class=head1>A RECONSIDERATION OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2><p>In 1958 the Lord enlightened me regarding certain matters in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John. In my study I was seeking to understand what the Lord means by the Father&#8217;s house and what is signified by His going and coming. I was not satisfied with the interpretation which said that the Lord&#8217;s going was His going to the heavens and that His coming denoted His second advent. It seemed to me that there was something wrong with this interpretation of the Lord&#8217;s word concerning His coming in these chapters. I realized, of course, that the vine in chapter fifteen is not something for the future; the vine and the branches are present now. Today we need to abide in Christ, and today He abides in us. Chapter fifteen describes something that is in the present. This caused me to question even more the common interpretation of the Father&#8217;s house and the Lord&#8217;s going and coming.<p>In my study of the Gospel of John I saw that the expression &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; is used twice in this book (2:16; 14:2). In 2:16 the Father&#8217;s house refers to the temple on earth; it has nothing whatever to do with the heavens. In this chapter the Lord indicates that He Himself in resurrection eventually will be the temple (2:19-21). I realized that, according to a basic principle in interpreting the Bible, the phrase &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; should not have a meaning in 14:2 that is different from the meaning of the same phrase in 2:16. Therefore, since the Father&#8217;s house in 2:16 refers not to the heavens but to the temple on earth, then the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 should also refer to His house on earth. In other words, in both 2:16 and 14:2 the Father&#8217;s house refers to the temple.<p>With this understanding of the Father&#8217;s house as the basis, I reconsidered how to interpret the Lord&#8217;s going and coming in chapter fourteen. Then I saw that the Lord&#8217;s going clearly refers to His death and that His coming was His coming back to His disciples in resurrection. I began to understand that through this process of death and resurrection the Lord prepared the way for us to enter into God, and that this is the way for us to be in the Father&#8217;s house. Furthermore, I began to see that the abode in 14:23 denotes one of the many abodes in the Father&#8217;s house spoken of in verse 2. Certainly, the abode in verse 23 is a believer. Likewise, the abodes in verse 2 are not rooms in a heavenly mansion, but believers. I was happy to have received the proper understanding of John 14.<p>Most Christians think that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion. At a funeral a minister will often comfort those who have lost a loved one by saying something like this: &#8220;Your departed loved one has gone to be in a heavenly mansion. Because he is in a better place, there is no need for you to weep. One day, all Christians will go to such a heavenly mansion, to a place with gates of pearl and streets of gold.&#8221; When I saw the proper understanding of the Father&#8217;s house, I realized that the common teaching concerning a heavenly mansion is superstitious and even deceptive. We should not preach any kind of falsehood; instead, we should only preach the truth. The common teaching concerning a heavenly mansion has no basis in the Bible, and especially no basis in the Gospel of John.<p>The Gospel of John speaks of divine things. For example, John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word, and that the Word was God. This is divine. In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; In this verse there is nothing physical; everything is divine. In keeping with this principle, although the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 refers to a temple, His dwelling place on earth, it is nevertheless a divine, spiritual matter. The Father&#8217;s house is not a physical mansion in the heavens. The Lord&#8217;s building is not such a mansion. The Lord&#8217;s building today is the church. In the New Testament the church is called the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). This living house of the living God is the Father&#8217;s house. Therefore, we may have the assurance to say that what is revealed in chapter fourteen of John is not a heavenly mansion. The Father&#8217;s house is not a physical entity. The Father&#8217;s house is God&#8217;s church, the Body of Christ. Moreover, this house is the vine described in chapter fifteen, and the vine is an organism, not an organization. Hence, the Father&#8217;s house in John 14 is the vine, the living organism, in chapter fifteen.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW MAN BORN IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>After I was enlightened of the Lord concerning the Father&#8217;s house in John 14, I began to understand John 16:16-24. I was further enlightened to see the meaning of the Lord&#8217;s word here concerning the man born into the world. I began to see that, according to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was begotten in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity. The Lord&#8217;s resurrection, therefore, was a birth. This means that when Christ was resurrected, He was born.<p>In the past I had wondered why it was necessary for Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, to be born, begotten, in resurrection as the Son of God. I wondered why Christ, who was already the only begotten Son, had to be born to be God&#8217;s Son in resurrection. In eternity He was the only begotten Son of God. Then in the incarnation He was born of Mary, and in resurrection He had another birth. I was enlightened to see that when Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with God&#8217;s sonship. In other words, strictly speaking, the human part of Jesus was not the Son of God, but was the Son of Man. Therefore, it was necessary for the human part of the Lord Jesus to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. How glad I was to see that although Jesus Christ was born of Mary as a man, as a man it was necessary for Him to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. Hence, Christ&#8217;s resurrection was a new birth for Him. He was already the only begotten Son of God before His incarnation. Then through incarnation He was born to be a man. Now in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. Furthermore, Christ&#8217;s being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers (Rom. 8:29) I also began to realize that the birth that took place through Christ&#8217;s resurrection involved the birth not only of an individual but of a group, a group that includes the firstborn Son and the many sons of God. This means that through one birth, one delivery, many sons were brought forth.<p>We should not think that Christ as the firstborn Son was born in His resurrection and that all His brothers, the many sons of God, have been born gradually during the centuries following His resurrection. We should not think that Peter was born at one time, Paul at another time, and each of us at a much later time. No, we were all born to be sons of God in the resurrection of Christ. This is the reason 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. Praise the Lord that when Christ was resurrected we were regenerated! All the believers, including the early apostles and those who will be the last to believe in the Lord, were regenerated together. We all were brought forth by means of a single universal delivery. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection millions of God&#8217;s sons were born. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the man born in 16:21 includes Himself as the firstborn Son and all the believers as the many sons.<p>In John 16:16 the Lord said to His disciples, &#8220;A little while and you shall behold Me no longer, and again a little while and you shall see Me.&#8221; The following verse indicates that the disciples did not understand what the Lord was saying: &#8220;Some of His disciples said then to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you shall not behold Me, and again a little while and you shall see Me; and, Because I go to the Father?&#8221; Then the disciples went on to say, &#8220;What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about&#8221; (v. 18). Realizing that they wanted to question Him further, the Lord went on to say, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world&#8221; (vv. 20-21).<h2 class=head1>THE HEAD AND THE BODY</h2><p>By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, now we know who this child, this man, is. This man is the very new man spoken of in Ephesians 2:15: &#8220;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.&#8221; This new man includes Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body. The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord. This new man, this child, was born through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE SECOND MAN</h2><p>Before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, there was only one man- Adam, including all his descendants as the components of this one man. But now, since the resurrection of Christ, there are two men in the sight of God-Adam and Christ. Adam is the first man, and Christ, including the church, is the second man. We should rejoice over the birth of the new man in resurrection much more than we do over the incarnation of Christ.<p>Adam, the man created by God, became sinful. As a result, he was a failure and became useless to God. Because of the fall, all the components of the first man are under God&#8217;s judgment and headed for the lake of fire. This means that, in the sight of God, the first man is finished.<p>God surely desires to have a second man. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, the second man was born. This was the reason the Lord could say to the disciples that they would rejoice when they saw Him again: &#8220;And you therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you&#8221; (John 16:22). We also need to rejoice at the birth of the new man.<h2 class=head1>A WONDERFUL SIGN</h2><p>The man in John 16 is a wonderful sign. The sign of the new man indicates that the old man, the first Adam, has been terminated. The first Adam was terminated by the death of Christ. But in resurrection the crucified Jesus and God&#8217;s chosen people were born to be the new man.<p>We need to have God&#8217;s view concerning this matter. According to our view, we were not born when Christ was resurrected, but we were to be born centuries later. However, according to God&#8217;s view, the divine view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. This resurrection was the birth of a corporate child. Therefore, when Christ came back in resurrection, in the sight of God He was a new man, a newborn child.<h2 class=head1>REJOICING AT THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>In John 16 the Lord told His disciples that they would rejoice when they saw Him again. This word was fulfilled in John 20. Verse 19 says, &#8220;When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.&#8221; The disciples were disheartened, but suddenly the Lord as the newborn child was in their midst saying, &#8220;Peace be to you.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be troubled or sorrowful. The newborn child is here. Did I not tell you that this child would be born? Now we all should rejoice at the birth of the new man.&#8221; Thus, verse 20 says, &#8220;The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.&#8221;<p>We also should rejoice that on earth today there is another man, the new man, that includes all the believers. This new man, who is born through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, is now spreading and growing throughout the earth. Praise the Lord that we are part of this new man!<h2 class=head1>THE HOUSE, THE VINE, AND THE NEW MAN</h2><p>In chapter fourteen we have the Father&#8217;s house, in chapter fifteen we have the vine, and in chapter sixteen we have the new man. The Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man all refer to one thing. As the vine is the explanation of the Father&#8217;s house, so the new man is the explanation of the vine. In other words, as chapter fifteen defines chapter fourteen, so chapter sixteen defines chapter fifteen. These three chapters are sections of one long message. The first section is on the Father&#8217;s house, the second is on the vine, and the third is on the new man. The new man is the definition of the vine, and the vine is the definition of the Father&#8217;s house. If we see this, we shall understand that the Father&#8217;s house is an organic entity, that it is the organism of the Triune God, the vine that is growing and spreading. According to chapter sixteen, this vine, this organism, is a man. Certainly the Father&#8217;s house is not a heavenly mansion. The Father&#8217;s house is a growing, spreading vine, and this vine is the vast, universal corporate new man.<p>Once again I say that we should celebrate the birth of this corporate new man with rejoicing. Oh, another man, the new man, has been born on earth through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection! This is the second man, the Triune God mingled with His redeemed ones.<p>This new man was born not through the incarnation of Christ, but through the death and resurrection of Christ. Therefore, we should rejoice over Christ&#8217;s resurrection even more than over His incarnation. What a wonderful sign is this sign of the new man! It is a great matter that this man, the newborn child, has been born into the world. The Lord told His disciples that they would rejoice, and they did rejoice. We also should rejoice over the birth of the corporate new man.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(13)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 16:16-24</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further the sign of the newborn child in John 16.<h2 class=head1>REBUILDING AND BIRTH IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; This word was actually a prophecy concerning the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. In this prophecy the Lord indicated that He would rebuild God&#8217;s house in resurrection. This rebuilding of the house of God in resurrection was to be an enlargement of God&#8217;s house. This is proved by the fact that not only was Christ Himself resurrected, but the entire new creation was resurrected with Him.<p>This resurrection was both a rebuilding and a birth. With respect to the house of God, it was a rebuilding in resurrection. With respect to the new man, it was a birth in resurrection. By this we see that, in one sense, the resurrection of Christ was a birth and, in another sense, it was a rebuilding.<p>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; This word is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the Lord in 2:19. In chapter two the Lord prophesied that He would build the house of God in resurrection and that He would build it in an enlarged way. If we did not have chapter fourteen, we would not see where the prophecy given in chapter two is fulfilled. If we say John 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion, then the Lord&#8217;s prophecy in 2:19 has no fulfillment. But in 14:2 is the fulfillment of 2:19. The concept of a heavenly mansion is far off the line of the divine thought in John&#8217;s Gospel.<h2 class=head1>DIVINE THINGS</h2><p>John&#8217;s writings are concerned altogether with divine things. Basically, in his Gospel John does not write of physical things. With divine things there is no physical element. Likewise, with divine things there is no element of space or time. The words what, when, and where are related to physical matters. The word &#8220;what&#8221; refers to the physical element; &#8220;when,&#8221; to the time element; and &#8220;where,&#8221; to the space element. But with divine things, especially with the divine life, there is no where, when, or what. These three matters do not have any position in the divine life.<p>As an example of what we mean in saying that there is no what, where, or when with divine things, let us consider the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. When was the Lord crucified? Concerning this question, we should pay attention to the fact that Revelation 13:8 speaks of the &#8220;Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.&#8221; When was Christ actually crucified-nineteen centuries ago, or from the foundation of the world? The proper way to answer this question is to say that from the human viewpoint He was crucified nineteen hundred years ago, but from the divine viewpoint He was slain much earlier, even from the foundation of the world. To say that Christ is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world means that from the time creation came into existence Christ was slain.<p>The reason Revelation 13:8 can speak of Christ as the One slain from the foundation of the world is that there is no time element with God. In His foreknowledge God saw that His creation would become fallen. From His point of view, the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world.<h2 class=head1>BORN IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>In the foregoing message we strongly emphasized the fact that the new man was born in the resurrection of Christ. However, according to the book of Acts, the church came into existence, or was born, on the day of Pentecost. This is the record according to history. All Christians can easily see that the church had its birth on the day of Pentecost. But many believers do not see that actually, in the divine view, the church as part of the new man was born in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. How, then, should we answer the question regarding when the church was born? The best answer is to say that from the human point of view, that is, from the historical point of view, the church was born on the day of Pentecost. This historical event is recorded in Acts 2. But according to the divine point of view, the church as part of the new man was born in Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>Recently a sister testified that before hearing the message on the sign of the newborn child in John 16, she thought that all regenerated people were born again one by one. She did not realize that we were all regenerated in Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>We know that the entire church is one new man, Christ the Head and we the Body. Could this man have many births? Could part of the new man have been born at one time and other parts born at different times? The answer to these questions is no. Just as an entire human being is born at one time, so the entire new man was born at the same time. It was not the case that the Head of the new man was born at one time and that the members of the Body were born at a later time. The new man had one birth, and every part of the new man was born at the same time.<p>We have seen that the new man was born in resurrection. As a divine matter, resurrection does not have the elements of time or space. Hence, we cannot say where the new man was born; that is, we cannot point out the place where the new man was born. Resurrection is not a place. Rather, resurrection is a divine matter, and in this divine matter there are not the elements of space or time. Because the new man was born in resurrection and resurrection is a divine matter, the birth of the new man was not a matter of time or place.<p>It is correct to say that the church was born on the day of Pentecost. But it would not be correct to say that the new man was born on the day of Pentecost. It would be a serious mistake to say this. In the human point of view the church as the Body of the new man came into existence on the day of Pentecost. However, the new man was not born on the day of Pentecost, but was born in resurrection fifty days earlier.<p>The day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was the day of firstfruit. Pentecost was celebrated fifty days after the feast of firstfruit. According to the record of history, the Lord Jesus was resurrected fifty days before Pentecost. From the human point of view, we may say that the Head of the new man came into existence in resurrection and that the Body of the new man came into being as the church fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost. However, we need to realize that in God&#8217;s economy and from the divine viewpoint, the entire new man came into being through a single birth at the same time. Therefore, in the sight of God the entire new man was born in resurrection.<p>As human beings, our view always has the limitation of time. From our perspective, the delivery of the new man in resurrection involves a long span of time. At first only the Head was born, and then gradually other parts of the new man come into being. Therefore, from our limited point of view, the birth of the new man takes place gradually throughout the centuries following Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>God&#8217;s viewpoint, however, is different. In His sight a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). As we consider the birth of the new man, it appears to us that some parts have already been born and other parts will be born in the future. But according to God&#8217;s view, everything regarding the birth of the new man has already been accomplished. In the sight of God, the whole new man was born through Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH FROM TWO DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS</h2><p>My purpose in giving this further word concerning the sign of the newborn child in John 16 is to prepare you to face those who may oppose this biblical truth. You may meet a Bible teacher who will say to you, &#8220;How can you claim that the church as the new man was born with Christ in resurrection? Let us study chapter two of Acts. According to this chapter, the church had not come into existence before the day of Pentecost. Why, then, do you say that the church was born with Christ?&#8221;<p>If you meet such a person, you may want to say, &#8220;I believe what is recorded in the book of Acts. However, the record of Acts emphasizes the human side, the physical side, which is easily seen. Anyone reading the New Testament can see that on the day of Pentecost the church came into existence. But another side, the divine, spiritual side, is revealed in the Gospel of John.&#8221;<p>It is possible to read this Gospel many times without seeing the significance of the birth of the new man in John 16. The reason for this difficulty is that the new man is a divine entity. The history of the church, on the contrary, is something human, physical, and outward.<p>Concerning the church we need to see both the human side and the divine side, both the physical side and the spiritual side. Yes, in Acts we see the physical side. Nevertheless, there is still the spiritual side revealed in the Gospel of John.<p>Many readers of the Bible see only the physical side of the church; they do not see the divine side. As we have pointed out, John&#8217;s writings emphasize the divine side, the spiritual side. We may take the Lord&#8217;s incarnation as an example. In Matthew and Luke we are given a historical account of Christ&#8217;s incarnation. In this account we are told how the Lord was conceived, how He was born, and where He was born. But in the Gospel of John we are not told anything about the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus. Rather, this Gospel says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (John 1:1, 14). John says nothing concerning when, where, or how. In other words, John does not give us an account that is merely historical.<p>History is concerned with the physical side. Regarding the incarnation of Christ, John gives us the divine facts. Incarnation is a divine fact, not merely a story of something that happened in history. In Matthew and Luke we have the historical record of the physical side, but in John we have a revelation of the divine facts. The reason for this is that John shows us the side of the divine life. With the divine life there are not the elements of time and space.<p>It is very important for us to see this matter. In order to get into the depths of the truths in John&#8217;s writings we must get beyond the elements of space and time and see things from the divine point of view. Although the church did come into existence on the day of Pentecost, according to the divine point of view, the church as the new man, including Christ as the Head and the members as the Body, was born in resurrection. Praise the Lord that we are now in the new man that has come into being through the death and resurrection of Christ!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(14)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 17:1-10, 22-24; 7:29; 12:23, 28; 13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8</h1><p>We come now to a very mysterious sign-the sign of the divine glorification. We have seen that anything that is divine is mysterious. This is true in particular of the sign of the divine glorification. We can explain what an abode, a vine, and a man are, but who can explain glorification? It is beyond our ability to explain fully something so mysterious as the divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>LIFTING UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN</h2><p>John 17:1 says, &#8220;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This verse is the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s prayer, a prayer that is the conclusion of the Lord&#8217;s message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. During His message, the Lord does not use the word &#8220;heaven&#8221; or refer to heaven. It may come as a surprise, then, that 17:1 tells us that the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven.<p>Some who have grasped only part of what we have said in foregoing messages concerning a so-called heavenly mansion may be troubled and say, &#8220;You have said that there is no such thing as heaven, and now you are pointing out the fact that, according to John 17:1, the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven when He prayed to the Father. Why do you say that there is no heaven?&#8221; I wish to make it emphatically clear that I have never said that there is no heaven. Yes, in earlier messages I did say that there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion, that the Father&#8217;s house spoken of by the Lord in 14:2 is not a house in the heavens. But I did not say that there is no heaven. According to the Scriptures, there certainly are the heavens.<p>Not satisfied with this explanation, some may go on to say, &#8220;Brother Lee, we agree with you when you say that you never denied that there are heavens. But didn&#8217;t you tell us that, according to the Bible, Christians do not go to heaven when they die?&#8221; Yes, I have said that the Scriptures do not teach that Christians go to heaven when they die.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that, according to the physical aspect of the truth concerning Christ recorded in the book of Acts, Christ ascended visibly to the heavens (Acts 1:9-11). Now He is remaining in the heavens until the time of restitution of all things (Acts 3:21). This verse indicates that heaven is an actual place. According to the Bible, there is a place in this universe called the third heaven, where God is and where the Lord Jesus went in His ascension and where He still is today. However, in these messages on the writings of John we are not emphasizing the physical aspect of the truth; instead, we are emphasizing the divine aspect. Nevertheless, even in emphasizing the divine aspect of the truth, we do not say that there is no heaven. We have said that, according to the Bible, there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion, and that it is not accurate to say that Christians go to heaven when they die.<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS IN PARADISE</h2><p>When some read the statement that Christians do not go to heaven when they die, they may ask an important question: According to the Bible, where do believers go when they die? Because this is a serious and reasonable question, we would spend some time to consider it before going on to cover the sign of the divine glorification.<p>A verse that is helpful in answering the question of where believers go after death is Luke 23:43: &#8220;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.&#8221; This is the word spoken to one of the thieves who was crucified with the Lord Jesus. This verse indicates that when the Lord Jesus died, He went to Paradise. Many Christians do not know that Paradise is in Hades. A strong proof that Paradise is in Hades is the comparison of the Lord&#8217;s word to the saved thief in Luke 23:43 with Acts 2:27 and 31. The verses in Acts reveal that when the Lord Jesus died, He went to Hades. Matthew 12:40 indicates that Hades is in &#8220;the heart of the earth&#8221; where the Lord Jesus went for three days and nights after His death. In Hades there is a pleasant section likened to Abraham&#8217;s bosom where Lazarus went (Luke 16:23). This is not the Paradise in the heavens; it is the Paradise in Hades.<p>Luke 16 indicates that in Hades there is a pleasant section, known as Paradise, where believers go when they die. According to this chapter, a sinful rich man died and went to a place of torment. A poor man named Lazarus also died and was taken by angels to Abraham&#8217;s bosom. Between these two regions of Hades there was a great gulf, and no one could go from one section to the other (Luke 16:26). One section was a place of torment, and the other was a place of comfort. We believe that Abraham is still in this pleasant place. According to the New Testament, the pleasant section of Hades is called Paradise.<p>Using 2 Corinthians 12:2-4, some have argued that Paul was caught away to Paradise when he was caught away to the third heaven. But 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 does not prove that Paradise is in the third heaven; rather, it proves the opposite. The word &#8220;and&#8221; at the beginning of verse 3 proves that Paul&#8217;s being caught away to the third heaven and his being caught away into Paradise mentioned in verses 3 and 4 are two different things. (The King James Version&#8217;s rendering &#8220;caught up&#8221; in verses 2 and 4 should simply be &#8220;caught&#8221; according to the Greek.) On the one hand, Paul was living on earth; on the other hand, he was &#8220;caught&#8221; to the third heavens and into Paradise. In this way, Paul received a full vision of the entire universe. As far as mankind is concerned, the universe is of three sections: the heavens, the earth, and the section under the earth (see Phil. 2:10). Paul came to know the things on earth, the things in heaven, and the things in Paradise. He had the greatest revelation of the universe as it is related to man.<p>When believers die, they become &#8220;naked&#8221; in the sense that they no longer have a body. For a human being not to have a body means that he is unclothed, in a condition that is not normal. No one can be in the presence of God in the third heaven in this naked, abnormal condition. Hence, the dead saints must be kept in a pleasant place until the time of their resurrection, when God will clothe them with a resurrected body, and they will be a complete person in a normal condition.<p>Some Bible students believe that Paradise, the pleasant section of Hades, was transferred to the third heaven at the time of Christ&#8217;s ascension. The original Scofield Reference Bible has a note on Luke 16:23 which indicates that Paradise was under the earth before Christ&#8217;s resurrection, but that by and with His resurrection and ascension it was transferred from under the earth to the third heaven. This note speaks of Hades before and after the ascension of Christ. According to this note, &#8220;Hades was formerly in two divisions, the abodes respectively of the saved and of the lost. The former was called &#8216;paradise&#8217; and &#8216;Abraham&#8217;s bosom.&#8217;&#8221; This note also says that the believing dead were with Abraham and that the believing thief was to be with Christ in Paradise on the very day Christ was crucified. Thus far, the note is almost accurate according to the Scriptures, and in essence we agree with it. However, the note goes on to say that a &#8220;change has taken place which affects paradise&#8221; and that Paradise is &#8220;now in the immediate presence of God.&#8221; This note uses 2 Corinthians 12:1-4 as a supposed proof that Paradise has been removed from Hades to the third heaven, the time of which change is presumed to be indicated by Ephesians 4:8-10.<p>It is a serious mistake to teach that Paradise has been removed from Hades to the third heaven. According to this mistaken understanding, when Christ resurrected and ascended, He took all the Old Testament saints, who were held captives in Hades, and transferred them to the third heaven. Therefore, according to this note in the old Scofield Reference Bible, Paradise, and all the Old Testament saints, have been transferred from Hades to the third heaven.<p>However, it is not accurate to say that these saints who have died are now in heaven. On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, Peter said, &#8220;David is not ascended into the heavens&#8221; (Acts 2:34). This indicates that even at the time of the day of Pentecost, David was still not in heaven. Concerning this, G. H. Lang, a teacher among the Brethren, says that &#8220;the Scripture nowhere declares&#8221; that after Christ&#8217;s ascension Paradise was transferred from under the earth to the third heaven, &#8220;but is wholly against&#8221; such a concept. He also points out the verse in Acts 2 where Peter said that David was not in heaven. No, Paradise has not been removed from Hades to the third heaven. Paradise is still a pleasant section in Hades, a section of comfort, where believers go when they die.<p>When a believer dies, his loved ones may be comforted with the truth that this one is now in Paradise. We should not cheat the believers by telling them that at death a Christian goes to a heavenly mansion. According to the truth of the Word of God, when a believer dies, he goes to Paradise, a place of comfort. On the one hand, we do not agree with the concept of a heavenly mansion and of going to heaven when we die; on the other hand, according to the Bible, we present the truth concerning Paradise.<p>Today&#8217;s church life eventually will consummate in the New Jerusalem. We may say that the church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. Some Christians dream of going to a heavenly mansion, but God&#8217;s desire is to be with us in the New Jerusalem. Instead of waiting to go to a so-called heavenly mansion when we die, we have the blessing of dwelling in the church life today. We may say that today&#8217;s church life is the best dwelling place, a real mansion, for it is God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth. In the church, which is a miniature of the New Jerusalem, we have the golden street, the pearl gates, and the jasper wall. As we have seen, gold signifies God&#8217;s nature; pearl, Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection; and precious stone (jasper), the Spirit&#8217;s transformation. Praise the Lord that in the church life we have a golden street, pearl gates, and a wall of precious stone! We are happy, and God is also happy, to enjoy such a church life, such a dwelling place today.<h2 class=head1>PARADISE, NOT A HEAVENLY MANSION</h2><p>According to the Scriptures, when a believer dies, he goes to Paradise. Paradise is not a place of labor; it is a place of rest, where believers wait for the physical resurrection. As believers, we have already experienced a spiritual resurrection at the time of our regeneration. When we were regenerated, we participated in a divine resurrection, a spiritual resurrection (John 5). In Paradise the believers rest and wait for their physical resurrection, when their spirit will come out of Paradise and enter into their resurrected body, and they become resurrected persons.<p>It is wonderful to be saved. Today we have the church life as a miniature of the New Jerusalem. If we die before the Lord&#8217;s coming, we shall go to Paradise and wait there for our physical resurrection. As saved ones, we may enjoy the church life today and have the assurance of going to Paradise if we die before the Lord&#8217;s coming.<p>Because so many believers are influenced by traditional concepts, we need to talk about these matters in a careful, sober way. We definitely do not teach that there is no heaven. If people receive this impression concerning our teaching, trouble will be caused unnecessarily. There certainly are the heavens. However, according to the Bible, there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion. Furthermore, when a believer dies, he does not go to heaven or to a mansion in heaven; he goes to Paradise to await the coming resurrection.<h2 class=head1>PARADISE AND THE THIRD HEAVEN</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 Paul says, &#8220;I know a man in Christ...such a one was caught away to the third heaven. And I know such a man...that he was caught away into paradise....&#8221; As we have indicated, it is commonly thought that these verses reveal that the third heaven in verse 2 is the same as Paradise in verse 4. This understanding, however, is not correct. The third heaven is a Hebrew expression denoting the highest heaven. The clouds may be regarded as the first heaven, and the sky above the clouds as the second. The third heaven, therefore, must be the heaven above the sky, in biblical terms, the heaven above the heavens, the highest heaven (Deut. 10:14; Psa. 148:4). Today the Father and the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, are in this highest heaven (Eph. 4:10; Heb. 4:14; 1:3). According to 2 Corinthians 12:2, Paul was caught away to this highest heaven.<p>Those interpreters of the Bible who regard the third heaven and Paradise as the same place think that Paul was caught away to Paradise when he was caught away to the third heaven. However, Paradise is not synonymous with the third heaven. We have seen that the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; at the beginning of verse 3, an important word here, indicates that Paul is describing two different experiences. First, Paul was caught away to the third heaven. Then he was caught away to Paradise. Hence, Paradise is not synonymous with the third heaven. Instead, it refers to a place other than the third heaven; it refers to the pleasant section of Hades.<h2 class=head1>WITH CHRIST</h2><p>Recently a sister said to me, &#8220;I heard a tape in which you said that a certain brother is now with the Lord. The Lord Jesus is in the third heaven, and the dead saints are in Paradise. If this brother is in Paradise, which is far away from the third heaven, where the Lord is, how can you say that he is with the Lord?&#8221; This question is related to Paul&#8217;s word in Philippians 1:23: &#8220;But I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it rather is much better.&#8221; To be with Christ is a matter of degree, not of place. While Paul was desiring to be with Christ in a higher degree, he was already with Him continually. Through his physical death, he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than he already enjoyed in this earthly life. When Paul wrote these words in Philippians 1:23, he was in bonds suffering mistreatment. Under those circumstances, we would expect him to long to be with Christ. Any believer in Paul&#8217;s situation would have the same desire.<p>To be with Christ is not an absolute matter; it is a relative one. Even now, we are with Christ. Wherever we are, we are with Him. Of course, while we are in this physical body, we are not as close to Christ as we shall be when we die, pass out of this world, and enter into another realm. But this does not mean that believers are taken to the heavens when they die. That will not occur until the day of resurrection and rapture.<p>No doubt, Paul was with Christ in prison. The fact that he was already with Christ indicates that being with Christ is not a matter of place. But although Paul was with Christ to a certain degree, he desired to be with Him into a higher degree. Paul knew that as a result of physical death he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than in his earthly life. For this reason, he could desire to depart and to be with Christ, regarding this as much better. If we understand this, we shall realize that to speak of a brother as being with the Lord does not mean that the brother is now in the third heaven instead of Paradise.<h2 class=head1>THE SOULS UNDER THE ALTAR</h2><p>Another portion of the Word related to the question of where the departed saints are is Revelation 6:9-11. Verse 9 says, &#8220;And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they held.&#8221; In Revelation 6:9 we see that the souls are underneath the altar. This points to the sacrifices killed on the altar. When a sacrifice was killed on the altar, its blood flowed down to the bottom of the altar and under it. The soul of the flesh is in the blood (Lev. 17:11). The fact that the souls of the martyred saints are under the altar indicates that, in the sight of God, they have all been offered to Him as sacrifices on the altar and that their blood, their life, was shed there. Now their position is under the altar. In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth. Hence, &#8220;underneath the altar&#8221; is underneath the earth, where the souls of the martyred saints are. It is the Paradise where the Lord Jesus went after His death (Luke 23:43). This is in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40), and is the comfortable section of Hades (Acts 2:27), where Abraham is (Luke 16:22-26). This Paradise differs from that in Revelation 2:7, which will be the New Jerusalem in the millennium.<h2 class=head1>THE SON OF MAN IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH</h2><p>We also need to consider Matthew 12:40: &#8220;For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.&#8221; The &#8220;heart of the earth&#8221; is called the lower parts of the earth (Eph. 4:9) and Hades (Acts 2:27), where the Lord went after His death. Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26). As we have seen, the section of comfort is Paradise. Hence, the heart of the earth, the lower parts of the earth, Hades, and Paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the one place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.<h2 class=head1>CAUGHT UP TO MEET WITH CHRIST</h2><p>Others may use 1 Thessalonians 4 to argue that the dead saints are with the Lord in heaven. They say that when Christ comes back, He will bring the dead believers with Him, and that this proves that they must be with Him now in heaven. But if we read this chapter carefully, we shall see that it says that the &#8220;dead in Christ shall rise first&#8221; and that those &#8220;who are living, who remain, shall be caught up at the same time together with them in the clouds&#8221; (1 Thes. 4:16-17). According to 1 Thessalonians 4, the dead saints will be resurrected and, along with the living ones, will be caught up to the air to meet with Christ. This proves that before the rapture the dead saints are not in the heavens.<p>If we consider carefully and soberly all these verses, we shall be clear from the Word of God what is the truth concerning heaven and Paradise. Although there certainly are heavens, there is no heavenly mansion, and the believers do not go to heaven when they die.<p>We should read the Bible carefully and not follow today&#8217;s traditional, superficial teachings. We must be clear that the saved ones are not in the heavens today, but are in a pleasant place which the Bible calls Paradise, the place the Lord Jesus visited after He died.<p>According to John 17:1, when the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father concerning the glorification of the Son, He lifted up His eyes to heaven. Although the Lord had spoken in the previous chapters about the Father&#8217;s house, the Father did not yet have a house on earth. Because God the Father was still in heaven, the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven. This action points to the fact that even at that time the Father did not yet have a house on earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(15)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 17:1-10, 22-24; 7:39; 12:23, 28; 13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the mysterious sign of the divine glorification. In order to know the significance of this sign, we need to understand what glory is. According to the natural human concept, glory is related to having a high position with honor. For example, a man wins an election for the office of President, and now he has the glory of occupying this high, honorable position. However, we should set aside this natural concept of glory when we read about glory in the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPRESSION OF THE DIVINE LIFE WITH ITS NATURE</h2><p>According to the Scriptures, glory is the expression of the divine life with its nature. Let us once again use a carnation seed as an illustration. A carnation seed does not have any glory. After such a seed is sown into the soil, it will grow into a plant, and eventually this plant will blossom. The blossoming of a carnation flower is the expression of the glory concealed in the life and nature of a carnation seed. A carnation seed has its particular life and nature. When this life and nature are released through the blossoming of the flower, we see the glory of a carnation plant. The carnation blossom is the glory, and this glory is the expression of the life and nature of a carnation plant. Although the blossom is the glory, the blossoming is the glorification of the carnation plant. In other words, when a carnation blossoms, it is glorified. Here we have both the glory and the glorification of the carnation plant.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S PRAYER CONCERNING HIS GLORIFICATION</h2><p>According to John 17:1, the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; Here we see glorification as the subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer. He was God incarnate, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God&#8217;s dwelling on earth (John 1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&#8217;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory (Matt. 17:1-4). But it was concealed again in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord had indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (John 12:23; 13:31-32). The Lord knew that He would pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released. He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed. Then His entire being, both divinity and humanity, would be glorified. In this way the Father would be glorified in Him.<p>In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&#8221; Before His incarnation, the Lord as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father. But when He put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh. His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him. The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and the divine nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord&#8217;s humanity. Outwardly, He appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Galilean and a Nazarene. This was the appearance of the shell of the Lord&#8217;s humanity. But within this shell the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory were confined and concealed. As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before. Yes, the Lord who lived among them was a man, but He lived in such a way that He expressed God. He expressed God&#8217;s life and nature. What the disciples saw in the Lord Jesus was the expression of the divine life and nature that were within Him. In his Gospel the Apostle John regards this expression as glorification.<p>According to John 17:6 the Lord said to the Father, &#8220;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me.&#8221; The Son came and worked in the Father&#8217;s name (5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to those whom the Father had given Him and to make the Father&#8217;s name known to them (17:26). Actually, for the Lord to make known to them the Father&#8217;s name was for Him to express the Father in His divine life and nature. The Lord lived among the disciples in such a way that He expressed the Father, and this expression was a matter of glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE MOUNT OF TRANSFIGURATION</h2><p>As we have indicated, the Lord was temporarily glorified in the presence of three of His disciples on the mountain of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-4). Matthew 17:2 says concerning this: &#8220;He was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light.&#8221; The glory that was concealed within the Lord&#8217;s humanity was manifested. This was the Lord&#8217;s glorification in the presence of His disciples. When the Lord was glorified on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine life and nature were expressed in a full way. Nevertheless, this glorification lasted only a short while, and then His glory was concealed again.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFIED THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>After living and walking with His disciples for more than three years, He gave them the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John. Then in His prayer to the Father the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son. In this prayer the Lord seemed to be saying to the Father, &#8220;Father, My humanity is opaque. Your life, nature, and glory have all been covered by the opaqueness of My flesh. Father, glorify Your Son. Father, cause My opaque humanity to become completely transparent so that Your life and nature can be expressed from within Me. My humanity, Father, is opaque because it is natural. The marvelous divine life, nature, and glory are covered by this humanity. Father, I have glorified You on earth. Now the time has come for You to glorify Your Son.&#8221;<p>We have seen that for the Father to glorify the Son was to cause the Son&#8217;s opaque humanity to become transparent. By what way could the Son be glorified? He could be glorified only through death and resurrection. Through death and resurrection the Lord&#8217;s natural humanity was transfigured. This means that through death and resurrection the Lord&#8217;s opaque humanity was made transparent. Therefore, when He was in resurrection, He was in glorification (Luke 24:26).<p>We may use electric lights as an illustration of Christ&#8217;s glorification. We may say that light is the glorification of electricity. In a sense, light is hidden in electricity. But when the switch is turned on and the light shines in a room, this light is the glorification of electricity.<p>The divine electricity-the divine life with the divine nature-was concealed within the Lord&#8217;s humanity, and that humanity was natural, something of the old creation. Hence, it was necessary that the Lord&#8217;s natural humanity should be transfigured through death and resurrection. The old creation was terminated by death. Then in resurrection the Lord was glorified. The divine electricity within Him was made manifest.<p>Through death the Lord terminated the old creation. When He entered into resurrection, He did not enter alone. Rather, the Lord entered into resurrection with the chosen people of God. Truly the Lord&#8217;s glorification is a wonderful, mysterious divine sign.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>The sign of the Lord&#8217;s glorification signifies many things. It signifies that the old creation has been terminated and also that the new creation has been germinated. Adam has been terminated, and the new man has come into being. It was through this glorification that the old man was done away with and that the new man has been brought forth. Therefore, in resurrection the new man was born with glory. Even in the church life today there is at least some amount of glorification.<p>We all need to be clear that glory is the expression of the divine life and the divine nature. If we live by the divine life and nature, we shall express the divine glory. We can testify of this from our experience in the church life. The more the saints live by the divine life and the divine nature, the more glorious the church life is, the more divine glory there will be in the church. The expression of this glory is the glorification of the Lord Jesus.<p>The Father is glorified in the Son. This means that when the Son is glorified, the Father is glorified as well. In John 12:28 the Lord prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s element to be expressed. The Father&#8217;s element, the divine element, which is eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. It was necessary for the shell of the Son&#8217;s humanity to be broken through death so that the Father&#8217;s element might be released and expressed in resurrection. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son. The Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification because in this glorification the Father is expressed.<p>When we live by the divine life with the divine nature, we express the Lord Jesus. This is the Lord&#8217;s glorification in us, and in this glorification the Father is glorified. Day by day this glorification is taking place.<p>The more glorification there is in the church life, the more the old creation is done away with and the more the new man is brought in. Therefore, glorification is actually the bringing in of the new man. The new man is absolutely in the divine glory. For this reason, the more glorification we have in the church life, the mo the new man is brought forth. However, if we have little or no glorification in the church, then more of the old man will be seen in the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF BREAKING</h2><p>We all have the Lord Jesus within us, and we can boldly testify of this fact. But can we say with confidence that the Lord is expressed from within us? We probably do not have the boldness to say this. Instead, if asked how much we express the Lord, we may say, &#8220;I am so strong in myself that often the Lord Jesus does not have a way to be expressed through me. Sometimes I feel that I am like a marble statue: hard and completely opaque. My &#8216;marble&#8217; self completely covers the Lord Jesus. How, then, can I express Him?&#8221; This is the reason we need the Lord&#8217;s breaking. Although we may be like marble, the Lord has a way to break us. By the cross He breaks our marble self.<p>We should have the faith to believe that more and more the Lord will be expressed in us. If we give Him the way to grow in us and to come forth from within us, we shall express Him more and more. Then the churches will be filled with the divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Let us consider once again what glorification signifies. We need to emphasize the fact that glorification signifies that the old man has been terminated and that the new man has come in. This new man spoken of in John 16 is the vine, and the vine is the Father&#8217;s house, the place where He is happy to dwell. We also are very pleased to dwell in the Father&#8217;s house. This means that the church is a mutual habitation for God and us. Praise the Lord that glorification is the new man, the new man is the vine, and the vine is the Father&#8217;s house!<p>We have seen that in John 17 the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him. To glorify the Son is actually to build the Father&#8217;s house. Hence, glorification is the building. Furthermore, the building is the cultivation of the vine. The vine tree comes into being through the birth of the new man. When the new man was born, the vine with all its branches came into being. Now the vine is growing and spreading, and this spreading is the divine glorification.<p>In the divine glorification the Triune God is glorified in humanity, and humanity is glorified in divinity. One day the Lord Jesus will come in a physical manifestation of glory, and we shall be brought into that glory. Then there will be glorification upon glorification and glorification within glorification. Eventually, there will be the ultimate consummation-the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the completion of the new man, the consummation of the vine, and the full building of the Father&#8217;s house. May we all see that the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, the new man, and the glorification are all one thing.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(16)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:19-29; 13:31; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1-5, 22</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further the sign of the divine glorification. As we consider this sign, we need to pay attention to a number of verses in the Gospel of John that speak of glory or glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE GLORIFICATION OF THE SON OF MAN</h2><p>First we come to John 12:19-29. According to John 12, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, He received a great welcome. Because the crowd went out to meet Him, the Pharisees said to one another, &#8220;You see that you are profiting nothing; behold, the world has gone after him&#8221; (v. 19). Then certain Greeks came to Philip and told him that they wanted to see Jesus (vv. 20-21). Philip and Andrew spoke to the Lord concerning this (v. 22). From the human point of view, this seemed to be a golden time for the Lord Jesus.<p>In 12:23 we have the Lord&#8217;s response to the situation: &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&#8221; Here we have the first mention of the glorification concerning which the Lord later prayed in chapter seventeen. Actually, the matter of glorification begins in 12:23 and continues through the Lord&#8217;s prayer for glorification. In verse 23 the Lord told His disciples that the hour had come for the Son of Man to be glorified. As verse 24 indicates, for the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element, His divine life, released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection, just as a grain of wheat releases its life element by falling into the ground and dying in order to bear much fruit and thereby bring forth many grains. Therefore, in verse 24 the Lord says, &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; What, then, does it mean for the Lord Jesus to be glorified? For the Lord to be glorified is for Him to die and be resurrected in order to bear much fruit. This means that the bearing of fruit is His glorification.<p>Verse 23 indicates clearly that the Lord was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is. The Lord was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains, that is, to bear much fruit. These grains are actually the believers who are constituted into the house, the vine, and the new man. The crucial point, and the point we are now emphasizing, is that the thought of glorification, which is the subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer in chapter seventeen, begins in 12:23.<p>In 12:28 the Lord prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; This is similar to the Lord&#8217;s prayer in 17:1: &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; These two prayers are both for the same matter-the matter of glorification. Knowing that the Father would be glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification, the Lord prayed first that the Father would glorify His name and then that He would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him.<p>According to 12:28, after the Lord prayed, a voice came out of heaven, saying, &#8220;I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.&#8221; The crowd heard the voice. However, they did not understand it. Some said that it had thundered, and others said that an angel had spoken.<p>In chapter thirteen the Lord again speaks regarding glorification. After Judas went out, the Lord said, &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately&#8221; (vv. 31-32). Shortly after speaking these words, the Lord went on to give the lengthy message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. Actually, this message began in 13:31, which speaks of the glorification of the Son. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s message and His prayer are both on the subject of glorification. In His message to His disciples the Lord spoke concerning glorification. Then in His prayer He prayed concerning the divine glorification.<p>Because chapters twelve through seventeen are concerned with the divine glorification, it would not be fitting to change the subject in the middle and bring in the thought of a heavenly mansion. What does a heavenly mansion have to do with the Son&#8217;s glorification? The building of a heavenly mansion has nothing to do with divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION AND MULTIPLICATION</h2><p>We have seen that when the Lord received a warm welcome and the people were about to exalt Him, He indicated to His disciples that the hour had not come for Him to be exalted. Rather, it was the time for the Son of Man to be glorified through death and resurrection. As 12:24 indicates, glorification is a matter of dying and rising so that many grains may be brought forth. This means that the Lord&#8217;s glorification was His multiplication, and His multiplication was His glorification. The Lord is glorified in the producing of many grains, which are for the building up of His Body.<p>To the Lord, the church is His Body, and to the Father, the church is His house. According to the principle in the New Testament, a person&#8217;s body may be considered his house. For example, in 2 Corinthians 5 Paul indicates that his physical body is his earthly house. In keeping with this principle, Christ&#8217;s mystical Body is also a house, the house of the Father. Furthermore, the Father&#8217;s house is very much related to the divine glorification. However, a so-called mansion in the heavens has nothing to do with the glorification of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE HOUSE, THE VINE, AND THE NEW MAN</h2><p>Recently the Lord has enlightened us to see that the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, the new man, the divine glorification, and the oneness in John 17 all refer to the same thing. If we simply tell others that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion, but it refers to God&#8217;s dwelling place, the church, they may not be convinced. We need to show them that the portion of the Gospel of John from 12:23 through the end of chapter seventeen is a complete section of the Word. This section begins with Philip and Andrew telling the Lord Jesus that the Greeks wanted to see Him, and with the Lord answering them that this was not the time for Him to receive an outward exaltation. The Lord indicated to His disciples that He had come for the purpose of dying as a grain of wheat and then rising up in resurrection to produce many fruits. The Lord seemed to be telling them, &#8220;I did not come for outward exaltation. My commission is to die and produce many grains in resurrection. Now the time is at hand for Me to fulfill this commission. The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&#8221;<p>For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to die and bring forth many grains in resurrection. These grains are for the constitution of the vine. To constitute the vine of many grains is equal to building up the Father&#8217;s house. Moreover, the building up of the Father&#8217;s house is equal to the planting of the vine, and this is equal to the birth of the new man. If we have this view, we shall realize that it would bring in an element that is altogether foreign if we were to teach that 14:2 speaks of a heavenly mansion. This section of the Gospel of John has nothing to say about a mansion in the heavens. Rather, this portion of John&#8217;s Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus was about to die and rise up in order to bring forth many grains for the constitution of His Body, and it reveals that His Body is the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man.<p>John 15:8 is a verse that strengthens the point concerning glorification that we have been making in this message: &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples.&#8221; In fruit-bearing the Father&#8217;s life, the divine life, is expressed. Therefore, He is glorified in fruit-bearing. This corresponds to the thought in 12:23 and 24 that glorification is a matter of multiplication.<h2 class=head1>THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FATHER IN THE SON</h2><p>The basic thought in this section of the Gospel of John is the glorification of the Father in the Son&#8217;s glorification. In this section certain verses tell us what this glorification is. In 15:8 we see that glorification is in fruit-bearing. According to 12:24, the one grain fell into the ground and died, rose up, and brought forth many grains. This is multiplication, and this multiplication is glorification. Now we need to see that the many grains in 12:24 are the many branches of the vine in chapter fifteen. The branches of the vine bear fruit, and this fruit-bearing is the glorification of the Father. Fruit-bearing is a matter of multiplication, propagation, production. This multiplication is the Father&#8217;s glorification. Certainly whatever is produced through the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection has nothing to do with a heavenly mansion.<p>Another verse related to glorification is 14:13: &#8220;Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.&#8221; For the Father to be glorified in the Son is to have His element expressed from within the Son. Whatever the Son does is to express the divine element of the Father. This is to have the Father glorified in the Son.<p>In order to have a fuller understanding of verse 13, we need to consider some of the preceding verses. In verse 10 the Lord says, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.&#8221; Here we see that whatever the Lord speaks is the Father&#8217;s work. This means that the Lord&#8217;s word is the expression of the Father. The Lord&#8217;s speaking expressed the Father, and this expression is a matter of glorification.<p>In verses 11 and 12 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; but if not, believe Me because of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works which I do shall he do also; and he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father.&#8221; When the Lord went to the Father, He brought us into the Father. Hence, where He is, there we are also. Now we can do the same thing the Lord did. And what did the Lord do? He expressed the Father.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word here concerning His disciples doing the same thing as He did in expressing the Father corresponds to His word in 17:22: &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them.&#8221; The glory which the Father gave the Son is the sonship with the Father&#8217;s life and nature to express the Father in His fullness. This glory the Son has given to His believers that they also may have the sonship with the Father&#8217;s life and nature to express the Father in the Son in His fullness. Now we have the divine life and nature to express the Father in the Son. In 14:12 the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;I am going to the Father, and I am bringing you all with Me into the Father. Where I am, you also will be, and what I have done, you also will do. When I go to the Father, you will be brought into Him. Then you will do the same work as I do to express Him.&#8221;<p>Now we are better able to understand what the Lord says in 14:13 about doing whatever we ask in His name so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. To be in the Lord&#8217;s name means to be one with the Lord, to live by the Lord, and to let the Lord live in us. The Lord came and did things in the Father&#8217;s name (5:43; 10:25). He was one with the Father (10:30), He lived by the Father (6:57), and the Father worked in Him (14:10). In the Gospels, the Lord as the expression of the Father did things in the Father&#8217;s name. In the Acts, the disciples as the expression of the Lord did even greater things in His name. According to the context, what the disciples should ask in the Lord&#8217;s name is related to glorification. Do you think that the Lord was expecting the disciples to ask for material riches when He said that He would do whatever they asked in His name? Certainly not! In the Lord&#8217;s name the disciples should ask for the glorification of the Father in the Son.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the whole section from 12:23 through 17:26 is on the glorification of the Son for the glorification of the Father. This is the main subject of this portion of the Gospel of John. First, the Son died and rose up to bear much fruit, to produce many grains. The Lord&#8217;s life was imparted to the disciples and made them branches of the vine for the bearing of fruit. The producing of the many grains and the bearing of fruit by the many branches are both matters of glorification. The fruit-bearing of the branches is a continuation of the glorification seen in the multiplication of the one grain into many grains. After the disciples received the life that was in the Son, they prayed. According to chapter one of Acts, they prayed for ten days. What do you think they prayed for? A better house? Good health? To be sure, they did not pray for such things. Actually, the Lord told them to wait in Jerusalem until power came upon them from the Father (Luke 24:49). Then they would become life witnesses of the Lord Jesus. As such witnesses, they would live the same life as the Lord lived. This living is a matter of glorification.<p>When we pray in the Son&#8217;s name, we are one with Him. When the Son came in the Father&#8217;s name, He was one with the Father. In like manner, to pray in the Son&#8217;s name means that we become one with Him in our prayer. Then whatever we pray, the Son will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. Now we see that whatever we pray in oneness with the Son, the Son will do for the Father&#8217;s glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>The divine glorification continues today. This glorification began with the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, and it is still going on. According to our viewpoint, we may say that the delivery that brought forth the Firstborn and the many brothers covers a long span of time, thus far, more than nineteen hundred years. In the sight of God, this delivery, although lengthy in time, is a matter of resurrection. Through this span of delivery in resurrection, we all have been brought forth to constitute the new man. However, there are yet others being brought forth. It is by this continuing delivery that the Lord&#8217;s prophecy in John 2 concerning the raising up of the temple is being fulfilled. The Lord said to the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (2:19). This raising up of the temple, which is the bringing forth of the new man, has not yet been completed. Because this delivery, this bringing forth, is still taking place, the divine glorification is also continuing today.<p>I believe that what the Lord has shown us concerning the divine glorification will help us to know what the church life is. The church life is actually the multiplication, the propagation, of Christ. This kind of church life is the divine glorification. The church has been produced in this glorification, and it continues to grow in the divine glorification. Whatever the church does in the matter of fruit-bearing is a continuation of the divine glorification. As the church spreads, this spreading is the fruit-bearing. For example, fifteen years ago there were only a small number of saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in Europe. But now this number has increased. This increase is a matter of fruit-bearing, and fruit-bearing is the divine glorification.<p>In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke we have a clear word concerning gospel preaching. In these Gospels the Lord commands the disciples to go forth and preach the gospel. But in the Gospel of John the Lord does not tell the disciples to go out to preach. Instead, in this Gospel the Lord indicates that we are branches of the vine to bear fruit. According to the Gospel of John, the bearing of fruit is actually the proper way to preach the gospel.<p>We may say that Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the synoptic Gospels, are on the human side, whereas the Gospel of John is on the divine side. On the human side, we have gospel preaching. But on the divine side, instead of gospel preaching we have a divine living, a living of fruit-bearing. Consider the branches of a vine. These branches do not preach; they simply grow in order to bear fruit. As branches of Christ, the true vine, we bear fruit that is the multiplication of the glorified Christ. This glorification is continuous. This continuous glorification is also the continuing delivery of the new man. In this fruit-bearing, in this delivery, Christ is glorified, and in His glorification the Father is glorified.<p>Suppose on earth today there were only a few Christians and these Christians were scattered throughout the world. What kind of glorification would this be? If this were the situation, there would be hardly any glory at all. But the multiplication of the Lord Jesus has spread throughout the earth. This continuous spreading of Christ is His glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>The Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man are all related to the divine glorification. As we have seen, the house, the vine, and the new man are all one thing. The Lord&#8217;s glorification began in 12:24 with the producing of many grains. These grains are constituents of the Body of Christ, the church, which is the house of God the Father. According to the book of Ephesians, the church is the Body of Christ in Ephesians 1 and the house of God the Father in Ephesians 2. In keeping with a basic principle in the New Testament, the Body is also a house. Furthermore, the house is a family. Even in the Old Testament we have the thought that children are the glory of their father because they are his multiplication. Children may be compared to the many grains that are the multiplication of one grain. A father is the one grain, and his children are the many grains produced out of him. Therefore, as the many grains are the glory of the one grain, so the many children are the glory of the father. This clearly illustrates the concept in this section of the Gospel of John. The Lord revealed the Father to His disciples. The Father gave Him authority over all flesh so that He might give eternal life to His chosen ones and thereby cause them to become God&#8217;s children. The children of God are also the many grains. All this is a matter of divine glorification.<p>It is far off the mark to say that John 14 speaks of the building of a heavenly mansion. This thought cannot be found anywhere in the New Testament. What the New Testament reveals is the church life consummating in the New Jerusalem. What some claim is the heavenly mansion in John 14 is actually what we mean by the church life. Eventually, according to the book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem will come down from the heavens (Rev. 21:2). Therefore, in eternity there will be no such thing as a mansion in the heavens, but the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church life on earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(17)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:23-28; 13:31-32; 15:8; 17:1-5, 22</h1><p>We may understand the Gospel of John in a natural way. Of course, it is easy to see that this book is on life, eternal life, that is, the life of God. However, we may not have penetrated into the depths of this book.<h2 class=head1>THE FUNCTION OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>I have been seeking to understand the Gospel of John for more than fifty years. It was in 1950 that this book began to be opened to me in a new way. Although I was very familiar with the Gospel of John, the depths of this book were not opened to me until after I left mainland China. Only then did I begin to enter into its depths. However, I did not see the whole right away; rather, I began to see one part at a time. First, the Lord showed me that in the first eleven chapters of this Gospel, John, the writer, uses nine cases to illustrate the function of the divine life.<p>The Gospel of John is not composed according to historical facts arranged in historical sequence. Instead, in writing this book John put together a number of different cases in order to give us a clear view of the divine revelation. John indicates this when he says, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name&#8221; (20:30-31). As a whole, the Gospel of John gives us a full and complete picture of the divine working. Therefore, in contrast to the Gospel of Luke, which gives us a history, the Gospel of John gives us a view, a revelation, of the divine working.<h2 class=head1>A REVELATION OF GOD&#8217;S DESIRE TO DISPENSE HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2><p>Some Bible teachers say that the Gospel of John was composed according to doctrine. However, I do not believe that this is accurate. In his Gospel John is not teaching doctrine; he is showing us a revelation. The revelation presented in the Gospel of John is that the Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit-is dispensing Himself into His chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people in order to make Himself absolutely one with them. It is by His life with the divine nature that God is making Himself one with His redeemed people. This means that the Triune God wants to enter into His people to be their life and even their nature so that they may have the same life and nature as He.<p>Because this Gospel reveals that God desires to enter into His people to be their life and nature, this Gospel speaks of regeneration, the new birth: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; (3:3). In the same chapter the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God....that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (vv. 5-6). This is also the reason that the Gospel of John tells us that we become children of God by believing in Christ the Son: &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name&#8221; (1:12). Hence, whoever believes in the Son of God is born of God. Because we have been born of God, we have His life and nature.<p>We may use human life and animal life as illustrations of this fact. A child always has the same life and nature as his father. This is also true of animals. A dog, for example, will have the same life and nature as the dog that begot him. In other words, he will be of the same kind. Because we all are children of Adam, we are of Adam&#8217;s kind; that is, we have the life and nature of Adam. Actually, all the children of Adam are of one family. In a similar way, we who believe in the Son of God have been born of God. Now we are God&#8217;s children with the divine life and the divine nature. Therefore, we all are of one kind, one family.<p>In order to make Himself one with created mankind, God desires to impart Himself into the man created by Him for His purpose. This is the divine revelation presented in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>We have seen that John selects nine cases and arranges them in a particular sequence in chapters three through eleven. The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration. The last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection. Both regeneration and resurrection are according to the same principle, a new beginning for something that is of the old creation. With both regeneration and resurrection something of the old creation has a new beginning. In fact, all the nine cases recorded by John in his Gospel follow this principle.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION AND FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p>According to John 12, after the nine cases, the Lord Jesus enjoyed a feast in Bethany. During that feast there was a strong testimony of resurrection, a testimony of the old becoming new. After attending that feast, the Lord Jesus received a warm welcome by the crowd in Jerusalem.<p>When the Pharisees realized that the Lord was welcomed by the crowd, they said to one another, &#8220;You see that you are profiting nothing; behold, the world has gone after him&#8221; (v. 19). It seemed to the Pharisees, those who opposed the Lord Jesus, that the whole world was welcoming Him. The following verses indicate that He was received not only by Jews but also by Greeks: &#8220;Certain Greeks...came to Philip...and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus&#8221; (vv. 20-21). Philip told Andrew about this, and together they spoke to the Lord concerning it (v. 22). No doubt, this was a golden time for the Lord, a time when He could have been exalted by men. If we had been the Lord Jesus, we probably would have been thankful for this opportunity to receive men&#8217;s exaltation.<p>However, the Lord&#8217;s response was quite unexpected: &#8220;Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified&#8221; (v. 23). When they heard this, the disciples may have said to themselves, &#8220;That&#8217;s right, Lord. This is the time for You to be exalted and glorified. For years You have been regarded by others merely as a lowly Nazarene. Now is the time for You to be exalted. This is the opportunity for You to be glorified.&#8221; If we had been there, we probably would have had such an understanding of the Lord&#8217;s word concerning being glorified. According to the human concept, to be glorified is to be exalted in the presence of others. For example, if a young person is elected as president of his class at school, he will feel that he is exalted and glorified.<p>In verse 24 the Lord Jesus goes on to explain what it means for Him to be glorified: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; Here the Lord indicates that for Him to be glorified does not mean that He will be exalted; it means that He will fall into the ground as a grain of wheat and die in order to rise up and bear much fruit. Hence, to be glorified is to bear much fruit. This means that glorification is a matter of fruit-bearing.<p>Once again we may refer to a carnation flower as an illustration of glorification. If a carnation seed is left alone and is not sown into the ground, it would be impossible for the glory within the seed ever to come forth and be expressed. The glory of a carnation seed can be seen only when the seed is sown into the soil. In a sense, by being sown, the seed dies and eventually grows up in resurrection. This thought is similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, where he uses the sowing of a seed as an illustration of resurrection. When a seed of a carnation plant dies by being sown into the earth, it will grow up, and this growing up will be the resurrection of the carnation seed. Eventually, the plant will blossom, and this blossoming will be its glorification. A grain of wheat, on the contrary, will eventually produce fruit, and this fruit-bearing will be its glorification. Both the blossoming of a carnation plant and the fruit-bearing of a grain of wheat illustrate glorification. A carnation seed is glorified when the plant blossoms, and a grain of wheat is glorified when the wheat brings forth fruit.<p>Jesus Christ is God incarnate. When He was incarnated, He entered into humanity and put on humanity as a shell. As a result, the Lord&#8217;s divine life and nature were confined and concealed within the shell of His humanity. Through incarnation, He became a seed that needed to bear fruit. This fruit-bearing was to be the Lord&#8217;s glorification. The only way for a grain of wheat to be glorified is for it to fall into the ground and die and then grow up. In this way the life within the seed is released to bring forth much fruit, and this fruit-bearing is glorification. By going through the process of death and resurrection, the Lord terminated the old creation and germinated the new creation in resurrection. In this resurrection He produced many grains. Those who believe in Christ are these many grains. As the many grains brought forth by Christ in His resurrection, eventually we are ground and blent together to be one loaf, one Body. This loaf, the Body, is the church. According to the New Testament, this church is the house of God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.<p>If we understand this matter, we shall be able to grasp the main point in chapter twelve of the Gospel of John. After the Lord Jesus took care of the nine cases recorded in chapters three through eleven, there was no need for Him to do anything further except to fall into the ground as a grain of wheat and then rise up in resurrection in order to have Himself released and expressed in the many grains. This is what it means for the Lord to be glorified.<h2 class=head1>MULTIPLICATION FOR GLORIFICATION</h2><p>In my study of the Gospel of John, I first came to understand chapters one through eleven. But for a long time I did not know what it meant for the Lord to be glorified. Now I see that there is a section of five and a half chapters, from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen, and that the subject of this section of John&#8217;s Gospel is the divine glorification. In this section of the Gospel of John we see how Jesus is glorified, that is, how He, the one grain, is multiplied to become many grains. As we have pointed out, the Lord&#8217;s multiplication was His glorification. Let us, then, keep in mind that the main topic of this section is how the Lord Jesus is multiplied in order to be expressed and glorified.<p>In 12:27 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Now my soul has been troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour. But for this cause I came to this hour.&#8221; As a man the Lord was troubled in His soul by the suffering of His coming death. So He prayed, &#8220;Father, save Me out of this hour.&#8221; He knew that He had come to earth in order to be multiplied and that the hour for this had come. But He also realized that in order to be multiplied it was necessary for Him to pass through great suffering. Therefore, His soul was troubled. On the one hand, He prayed that the Father would save Him from the hour. On the other hand, He went on to say, &#8220;But for this cause I came to this hour.&#8221;<p>Then in verse 28 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name. There came then a voice out of heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&#8221; The meaning of the Lord&#8217;s prayer to the Father for the Father to glorify His name is that when the Lord Jesus was glorified, the Father&#8217;s life within Him would also be glorified. To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s divine element, the eternal life, which was the incarnated Son, to be released and expressed through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection.<p>The prayer in 12:28 is very similar to the prayer in chapter seventeen. John 17:1 says, &#8220;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; Now we can see that before the Lord gave the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, He prayed concerning glorification. Then after giving this message, He again prayed concerning His glorification. This is another indication that these chapters are one section concerning the glorification of the Lord Jesus. As we have pointed out, for the Lord to be glorified is for Him to be multiplied, and this means that the divine life within Him, the Father&#8217;s life, would be multiplied and thereby be glorified.<p>In 12:32 the Lord said concerning His death, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&#8221; This is a matter of the Lord&#8217;s multiplication. Through His death the Lord attracted many to Himself, and all those who have been attracted to Him have become the many grains in His resurrection. These many grains are the Lord&#8217;s multiplication and glorification.<p>Let us go on to 13:31 and 32, where &#8220;Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.&#8221; These verses concerning the glorification of the Son of Man are another indication that this section of the Gospel of John is concerned with the divine glorification. Once again, for the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection. In this way God the Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification.<p>Shortly after uttering these words in chapter thirteen, the Lord went on to give His disciples a message in which He spoke concerning the Father&#8217;s house, the true vine, and the new man. As we have seen, these matters all refer to one thing, and they are all related to the divine glorification. Following this message, the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen concerning His glorification. The divine glorification is the key that opens this portion of the Gospel of John. If we do not see the matter of glorification, we shall not be able to understand this section of John&#8217;s Gospel. We have seen clearly that the main subject of these five and a half chapters is the glorification of the Son for the glorification of God the Father.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(18)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:23-24, 27-28; 13:31-32; 15:8; 17:1; 14:2; 15:1; 16:21</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that the main subject of the section of the Gospel of John from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen is the divine glorification. We have also seen that in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen three main things are covered: the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man. Actually, these all refer to the same thing, and they are all related to the divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE MULTIPLICATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE SON OF MAN</h2><p>According to 12:23 and 24, the Lord&#8217;s glorification is a matter of His multiplication: &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; If, as is commonly supposed, the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 denotes a heavenly mansion, what relationship would there be between this mansion and the multiplication of Jesus for His glorification? The answer is that there would be no relationship between a heavenly mansion and the multiplication and glorification of the Son of Man. To be sure, the Father&#8217;s house does not refer to a heavenly mansion. This section of the Word is on the glorification of Jesus through His multiplication in resurrection. A so-called heavenly mansion has no relationship whatever to the multiplication of the Lord Jesus.<p>The vine in chapter fifteen, however, is certainly related to the Lord&#8217;s multiplication. In 15:5 the Lord said, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches.&#8221; The branches of the vine are for the multiplication of the vine.<p>The new man in chapter sixteen also is a matter of multiplication. First, there was an individual man-Christ. Then in resurrection He with the believers was born to be a corporate man. This new man, therefore, is also the multiplication of Christ.<p>Although the vine and the new man are related to Christ&#8217;s multiplication, a heavenly mansion is not. In keeping with the fact that this section of the Gospel of John is concerned with the Lord&#8217;s glorification through His multiplication, the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2, as the multiplication of the Lord Jesus, must be the church. In the New Testament the church is called the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15). As the house of God, the church is the multiplication of Christ.<h2 class=head1>NOT A HEAVENLY MANSION</h2><p>Anyone who is clear concerning the basic subject of this portion of the Gospel of John will not oppose us for saying that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion. However, some may argue strongly if we present only 14:2 and 3 to them and then try to tell them that the house here is not a mansion in the heavens, but is the church as God&#8217;s house on earth today. We may find it very difficult to convince them. But if we ask them to read the five and a half chapters of John from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen and pay special attention to the matter of glorification, they may be convinced to drop their concept and accept the revelation of the pure Word.<p>When we have the opportunity, we should help others see that the word &#8220;glorified&#8221; is first used in this section in 12:23 and that it is used a number of times throughout this section, in particular in chapter seventeen. Then we should point out that this section is on the glorification of the Lord Jesus, a glorification that involves His multiplication. If the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 were a mansion in the heavens, then it would have nothing to do with the Lord&#8217;s multiplication and glorification.<p>We all need to know the truth, experience the truth, and learn to present the truth to others. The best way to present the truth concerning the Father&#8217;s house to someone is to read together with him these five and a half chapters concerning the Lord&#8217;s glorification. If we read these chapters properly and accurately, it will be clear that there is no way that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 can refer to a heavenly mansion. Once again I would point out that a heavenly mansion would have nothing to do with the multiplication of the Lord Jesus. The Lord&#8217;s multiplication cannot be in the heavens; it must be on earth. Furthermore, His multiplication must be the spread of Himself. The church as the house of God is the genuine spread of the Lord Himself. But a so-called mansion in the heavens, as a physical entity, could never be the Lord&#8217;s spread. Therefore, the interpretation which says that the Father&#8217;s house is a heavenly mansion is altogether contrary to the context.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>If certain ones still are not convinced that the Father&#8217;s house does not denote a heavenly mansion, after considering the subject of glorification in these chapters in relation to the Father&#8217;s house, you may try to present the truth another way. You may say, &#8220;Brother, you believe that the Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen is a heavenly mansion and that you will go to this mansion when you die. What will be the ultimate consummation of this heavenly mansion?&#8221; He may tell you that eventually the heavenly mansion will become the New Jerusalem. If he answers in this way, you should go on to say, &#8220;How wonderful that your heavenly mansion eventually will be the New Jerusalem. Let us read Revelation 21:10, where the Apostle John tells us that he saw the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. This verse indicates that your heavenly mansion, if it becomes the New Jerusalem, will not remain in the heavens. Instead, it will come down to earth. Furthermore, the foundations of this mansion, which has now become the New Jerusalem, bear the names of the Apostles. This indicates that your heavenly mansion, the New Jerusalem, is the consummation of the church, of which the twelve Apostles are the foundations. Eventually, you will go to the New Jerusalem by way of a mansion in the heavens, but we shall go to the New Jerusalem by another way. This means that, ultimately, you will lose your heavenly mansion, but we all shall be together in the New Jerusalem.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS IN PARADISE</h2><p>Suppose someone says to you, &#8220;You claim that the Father&#8217;s house in John 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion. Since you don&#8217;t believe in a heavenly mansion, where do you think you will go when you die?&#8221; You may reply, &#8220;If I should die before the Lord comes, I would go to Paradise. The New Testament reveals that when a believer dies, his spirit and soul go to Paradise. Therefore, if I should die, I would go to Paradise and wait there for the resurrection. When the Lord Jesus comes back, all the dead in Christ will be resurrected. Then we shall be brought together with the living saints to meet the Lord Jesus. Then after the millennium, the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven to earth.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>A GNOSTIC CONCEPT</h2><p>What we have been presenting here is the pure truth of the Word, the truth without any leaven. Actually the concept that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 is a heavenly mansion is a Gnostic concept. The thought of going to heaven when we die comes from a pagan source. The Greek word for house in 14:2, oikia, was used by the Gnostics to mean a heavenly mansion. This usage, being Gnostic, is pagan and heretical.<p>Some expositors of the Bible even think that John was influenced by Gnosticism. These expositors make a serious mistake in saying this. They understand the word oikia in a way that is similar to the understanding of the Gnostics. John certainly was not a Gnostic or influenced by Gnosticism, and oikia in 14:2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion. Instead, here oikia refers to the Body of Christ, the church. We have seen that to Christ the church is the Body, whereas to the Father the church is a house.<h2 class=head1>TWO GREEK WORDS USED INTERCHANGEABLY</h2><p>Some who know Greek and who also hold to the concept that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 is a heavenly mansion may point out that in 2:16 and 14:2 different Greek words are used for house: oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2. They may go on to say that originally oikos had a wider range of meaning than oikia. They may also say that, as used in the Gospel of John, oikos in 2:16 refers to the temple, but they may claim that oikia in 14:2 refers to a particular kind of dwelling in the heavens.<p>How should we deal with this objection to our statement, which is based on the Scriptures, that the house in 14:2 definitely does not refer to a mansion in the heavens? Perhaps the best way is to point out that in the New Testament oikos and oikia are used interchangeably. For example, in 1 Corinthians 1:16a Paul says, &#8220;I baptized also the household of Stephanus.&#8221; Here Paul uses the word oikos for household. In 1 Corinthians 16:15 Paul says, &#8220;You know the household of Stephanus, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia.&#8221; In this verse Paul uses oikia. Therefore, Paul twice mentions the household of Stephanus, in the first instance using the word oikos and in the second, the word oikia. This is a strong proof that, by the time the New Testament was written, oikos and oikia were synonyms and were used interchangeably.<p>If Paul used these two words interchangeably in 1 Corinthians, we may also say that they are used interchangeably in the Gospel of John. Anyone who cares to study this matter will learn that elsewhere in the New Testament oikos and oikia are used interchangeably. The point we are making here concerning the Gospel of John is that oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2 do not refer to different things; rather, they have the same basic meaning.<p>Some believe that even in the New Testament some trace of the distinction between oikos and oikia still exists. They would say, and in this way they may be correct, that oikos in 2:16 has a somewhat broader meaning than oikia in 14:2. As used in 14:2, oikia may have a more narrow, purified sense than oikos.<p>We should remember that before the Lord spoke about the Father&#8217;s house, Judas, the false one, had left. This indicates that the house in 14:2 is something pure, for it is related to the divine glorification. Therefore, the house, the church, is pure and does not include any false disciples. It is purely the multiplication of the Lord Jesus Himself. Certainly the many grains of wheat produced by the unique grain do not include any tares. Judas was a tare, and this tare was eliminated before the Lord spoke the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. Hence, the Lord was multiplied in a pure way to become many grains, and among these grains there are no tares. Now all these grains are being blended together to become one loaf, and this loaf is Christ&#8217;s Body. In the Body of Christ, there cannot be any foreign elements. If Judas had remained, he would have been a foreign element in this organic Body. But such a mixture could not be permitted. The Father&#8217;s house is pure, and the grains produced by Christ as the unique grain constitute a pure multiplication of Him.<p>The important point we are making here regarding oikos and oikia is that by the time the New Testament was written these words were used as synonyms. Actually, it is very difficult to find any distinction between them. Therefore, those who insist in holding to the concept that the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2 denotes a heavenly mansion cannot rightly claim that the fact that different Greek words are used for house in 2:16 and 14:2 proves that oikia in 14:2 refers to some kind of dwelling place in the heavens, whereas oikos in chapter two refers to God&#8217;s house, the temple. No, both oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2 refer to the dwelling place of God on earth.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION, FRUIT-BEARING, AND THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>We have seen that as the multiplication of Christ, we are His glorification. According to John 15:8, the Father is glorified when the branches of the vine bear fruit: &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&#8221; Why is it that God the Father is glorified when we bear much fruit? The reason the Father is glorified through our bearing of fruit is that in fruit-bearing there is the manifestation of God as life from within us, and this manifestation is the Father&#8217;s glorification.<p>The divine glorification is also related to the birth of the new man in chapter sixteen. The bringing forth of this new man covers a long span of time. This delivery, which is in resurrection, is the multiplication and glorification of the Lord Jesus. The full definition of this glorification is covered in the five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen.<p>After the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen, He presented Himself to be arrested, judged, sentenced, and crucified. According to the Gospel of John, the Lord&#8217;s death was His going away, and His resurrection was His coming to the disciples. Through His going and His coming, He produced the many grains of wheat, and these grains are His glorification. In this glorification the Body is produced. This Body is the Father&#8217;s house, the Father&#8217;s house is the vine, and the vine is the new man to express God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.<p>After the Lord was resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and breathed on them (20:22). In this way the disciples received Him as the pneuma. As the pneuma the Lord entered into the disciples and remained with them. According to chapter twenty-one, the Lord was even with some of the disciples when they were fishing.<p>In the Gospel of John there is no record of Christ&#8217;s ascension. But Acts, which is written from another angle, speaks clearly of the Lord&#8217;s ascension. In John&#8217;s Gospel we see that the resurrected Christ remains within us essentially to be our life so that we may live by Him to bear fruit. Through this fruit-bearing we continue the Lord&#8217;s multiplication and glorification. This is the continuation of the glorification of Christ in the church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(19)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 17:1, 11, 21-23</h1><h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION AND THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>In previous messages we have pointed out that the glorification in chapter seventeen is the building up of the Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen, the spreading of the vine in chapter fifteen, and the growth of the new man in chapter sixteen. This means that the glorification, the house, the vine, and the new man are one.<p>Apparently the glorification for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17 has nothing to do with the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man. This prayer, however, is the conclusion of the Lord&#8217;s message given in the three foregoing chapters. As a rule, a concluding prayer should strengthen the points of a message. In keeping with this principle, we may say definitely that the subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer in chapter seventeen should refer to the main points given in His message. Therefore, when the Lord prayed for His glorification, He also prayed for the building of the Father&#8217;s house, the spreading of the vine, and the growing of the newborn child.<p>It is important for us to see that the glorification of the Son for the glorification of the Father is the building of the Father&#8217;s house. Furthermore, this glorification is the spreading of the vine and the growth of the new man. In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; In this single utterance concerning His glorification the Lord was praying concerning the building of the Father&#8217;s house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man.<p>In chapters twelve through seventeen of the Gospel of John we see that the divine glorification is actually a matter of the church life. According to 12:24, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground as a grain of wheat, died, and then was raised up to produce many grains. These many grains are the glorification, the multiplication in resurrection, of the unique grain. The many grains produced out of the one grain are the glorification of this grain. We, the believers, are the many grains. Moreover, as the many grains, we are the members of the Body, the abodes of the Father&#8217;s house, the branches of the vine, and the parts of the new man. To be sure, all this is a matter of the church life. The glorification of the Son is for the glorification of the Father, and this glorification is the building of the Father&#8217;s house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man. This glorification is actually the church life.<p>Recently some brothers testified that when they came to the church life, they saw the glory of God. They saw the building up of the Father&#8217;s house on earth. We may also say that they saw the many grains, the many abodes of the Father&#8217;s house, the many branches of the vine, and the many parts of the new man. This is not only glory-this is glorification. Praise the Lord that we in the church life are in this marvelous divine glorification!<p>For many years I tried my best to understand the Lord&#8217;s prayer in John 17. I wondered why the Lord began this prayer by asking the Father to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify Him. How happy I am that we have been enlightened to see that the glorification in chapter seventeen is the building up of the Father&#8217;s house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man! After giving a message on the house, the vine, and the new man, the Lord went on to pray concerning the points He had covered in His message. Now we are in this glory and glorification today.<p>In this message we shall go on to consider the last of the signs in John 14 through 17, the sign of the believers&#8217; oneness in the Triune God. In His prayer the Lord prayed first for glorification, and then He prayed for oneness. Both glorification and oneness in chapter seventeen are signs.<p>Many Christians talk about oneness without knowing what oneness really is. Their oneness may be merely a social union. But the oneness in John 17 does not signify that. Because the oneness here is divine, it signifies something divine.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN THE FATHER&#8217;S NAME</h2><p>The oneness revealed in John 17 is the oneness in the Father&#8217;s name. Verse 11 says, &#8220;I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world; and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.&#8221; The oneness spoken of here certainly is not any kind of social unity. Rather, this is something of the divine name. In the Bible, especially in the Gospel of John, the name denotes a person. Thus, the Father&#8217;s name is actually the Father Himself. When you call a person by name, that person will respond.<p>When you call a person by his name, you expect a certain response, a certain kind of action. In 17:11 to be kept in the Father&#8217;s name is to be kept in the Person of the Father through His action. Today the Father is active in building up His house on earth. How does He build up His house, the church? The Father builds His house in His Person. In His name, that is, in His Person, the Father is now actively building His house, the church.<p>The reason there is so little oneness among Christians is that too few are in the name of the Father, in His Person and action, in a practical way. Instead, nearly every believer lives and acts altogether in his own person. It is difficult to find Christians who live, act, and work in the Person of the Father. The result of believers living and acting in their own person is division. This is the source of denominations. Divisions are the result of the opinions and character of certain ones. Divisions also come as a result of a person&#8217;s own action, an action that is not in the name of the Father. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should not be Christians living in our own person. Instead, we should be those living in the Person of our Father.<p>As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus did not come in His own name. In 5:43 He said, &#8220;I have come in the name of My Father.&#8221; Even though He is the Son of God, He did not come in His name, but He came in the name of the Father. According to 10:25, the Lord&#8217;s works were done in the name of the Father. The Lord Jesus never did anything in His own name. He came and worked in the Father&#8217;s name; that is, He acted in the Father&#8217;s actions. We should follow the Lord to live and act in the Father&#8217;s name.<p>If we live in the Person of the Father and act in the Father&#8217;s action, the result will be oneness. But if we live and act in our own person, we shall have division. As soon as a believer lives in his own person and acts in his own action, he himself becomes a division. Suppose there are three hundred believers in a local church. If all these believers live and act in their own person, there will be three hundred divisions.<p>Oneness is first a matter of being in the name of the Father, of being in the Father&#8217;s Person and action. In order to have such a oneness, not only must our opinion be terminated, but even our own person must be terminated. In order to have oneness, we should not live in ourselves or act in our own action. On the contrary, we should all live in one Person-in our Father.<p>We can live in the Father&#8217;s name because we have His life. John 17:2 says, &#8220;Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&#8221; Because we have the Father&#8217;s life, we can live in the Father&#8217;s Person. However, if we did not have His life, we would not have the ability to live in His Person. As long as we live by the Father&#8217;s life, we live in His Person and act in His action. The result of such a living is oneness.<p>In order to have a oneness that does not fluctuate, we need to be in the name of our Father. However, if our oneness is a matter of having the same opinion or believing the same doctrine, this oneness will not last. Today you may hold a certain opinion or agree with a particular doctrine. But after a period of time your opinion may change, and your understanding of that doctrine may also change. As a result, the oneness that depended upon opinion and doctrine will fluctuate. The oneness among most Christians today is a fluctuating oneness, a changeable oneness. But I can testify that the real oneness, the oneness we have been experiencing in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, never changes, never fluctuates, because this oneness is the oneness in the Father&#8217;s Person. We are one in the Father&#8217;s Person, life, and action. What a wonderful oneness!<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>In 17:21 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&#8221; Here we have the oneness in the Triune God. Simply to be in the Father&#8217;s name is not sufficient for our oneness. We also need to be one in the Triune God, one in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In order to understand what it means to be one in the Triune God, we need to study all the points we have covered in the foregoing messages concerning the Triune God. We must be kept in the Triune God in order to be safeguarded in the oneness. John 17:21 is a crucial verse. Here the Lord Jesus prayed that His disciples would be one in the Triune God.<p>Oneness in the Triune God is more than unity or union. The unity of believers is greater than the union of believers, but oneness is better than unity. Our oneness in the Triune God is not a matter of union or unity. Our oneness is a matter of being blended into one.<p>When some hear of this kind of oneness, they may ask how it is possible for believers to be blended into one. To be sure, in ourselves we cannot be blended into one. Only in the Triune God can we be blended into one. When the Triune God dispenses Himself into all the inward parts of our being, we are mingled with Him. The more we are mingled with the Triune God through His dispensing, the more we are mingled, blended, together in the Triune God. All those who are mingled with the Triune God can easily be one with others who experience this mingling. However, a brother who is in the self cannot participate in this oneness.<p>Those believers who claim to be united may stay together for a period of time. But should something happen to shake their unity, they may easily fall apart. Their unity can be compared to bricks that are attached in some way, whereas the oneness in the Triune God can be compared to solid rock. When times are peaceful, those who have only unity may seem to have real oneness. But when the shaking comes, their unity will collapse. But those who are saturated with the Triune God and mingled with Him remain in the oneness no matter what happens. Nothing can separate them; nothing can divide them. They cannot be separated or divided, because their oneness is the oneness in the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN THE GLORY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>John 17:22 and 23 say, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&#8221; Here we have the oneness of the believers in the Father&#8217;s glory given to the Son and given to the believers by the Son. This glory is for the expression of God through His life and nature. In the prayer in this chapter, the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, &#8220;Father, I have been enjoying glory with You from eternity. I have given this glory to My disciples. O Father, keep them one in this glory.&#8221; This is not merely the Triune God; this is the glory, the expression, of the Triune God. Therefore, our oneness is in the Father&#8217;s name, in the Triune God, and in the glory of the Triune God.<p>If we have the oneness in the Father&#8217;s glory, the oneness in His expression, we shall not express ourselves. Among today&#8217;s Christians, it is common for believers to express themselves. But in the recovery our desire is to express the Triune God.<p>The oneness among us has a threefold protection or safeguard. We are safeguarded by the Father&#8217;s Person, by the Triune God, and by the glorious expression of the Triune God. How marvelous to have the oneness in the Father&#8217;s name, in the Triune God, and in the glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to us!<p>The oneness revealed in chapter seventeen is for the Father&#8217;s glorification in the Son. This is the reason the Lord prayed in verse 1, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This oneness is actually the divine glorification. The Son is glorified in the church, and the Father is glorified in the Son. This glorification is the mingling and also the oneness. As we have seen, the glorification in John 17 is the new man, the vine, and the Father&#8217;s house.<p>In chapters fourteen through seventeen we see five main things: the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, the new man, the divine glorification, and the oneness. Actually, all these five things are one. This is the unique subject of the Lord&#8217;s message in chapters fourteen through sixteen, and it is the main point of His prayer in chapter seventeen. The Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen is the vine in chapter fifteen, and the vine is the new man in chapter sixteen. After speaking concerning these things, the Lord prayed for glorification and oneness. Tracing these matters backwards, we may say that the oneness is the glorification, the glorification is the new man, the new man is the vine, and the vine is the Father&#8217;s house.<p>I am very thankful to the Lord for opening these chapters to us. We have seen the vision concerning the Father&#8217;s house. In particular, we have seen that the Father&#8217;s house is not a heavenly mansion. The Lord has enlightened us to see that the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, the new man, the glorification, and the oneness are all one thing. The glorification for which the Lord prayed is actually the divine mingling with humanity, and this mingling is the marvelous oneness revealed in chapter seventeen. This oneness is safeguarded in the name of the Father, in the Triune God, and in the glorious expression of the Triune God. This is the central point of the revelation in the New Testament.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 18:1-40; 12:23-24, 27-28, 31-32; 13:31-32; 17:1</h1><p>In this message we come to chapter eighteen of the Gospel of John. Apparently it is easy to read and understand this chapter. Actually, it is not easy to find the extract of this chapter. We can easily see the substance of John 18. After reading this chapter, we may be able to recite the events described in it. This chapter tells us that the Lord Jesus went to the garden, that He was betrayed by Judas, and that He was arrested, bound, brought to the high priest, and judged by him. Afterward, He was brought before Pilate, who did not find any fault with Him. These are some of the main points in chapter eighteen. But what is the extract of this chapter?<p>If we compare the opening of the Gospel of John with chapter eighteen, it will seem that chapter eighteen is much lower than chapter one and that it does not match it. John&#8217;s Gospel opens with the words: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Then we are told in 1:14 that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. What is the connection between such statements in chapter one and the account in chapter eighteen? What connects these chapters? It is difficult to see the connection between chapters one and eighteen. In order to see the connection, we need to penetrate into the depths of the Gospel of John and find what is the extract of chapter eighteen. In this message and in the message following we shall attempt to get into the extract of this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE EMPHASIS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN  CONCERNING THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2><p>Before we come to chapter eighteen itself, we need to ask an important question: According to the Gospel of John, why did the Lord Jesus die on the cross? As Christians, we may immediately respond by saying that the Lord Jesus died to accomplish redemption for us. On the cross He took away the sin of the world. This answer, of course, is correct. However, in the Gospel of John the emphasis is not on the Lord&#8217;s death for redemption. I do not mean by this that this Gospel says nothing concerning redemption. John 1:29 clearly speaks of the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. My point is that in John&#8217;s Gospel the emphasis with respect to Christ&#8217;s death is not on redemption. This is the emphasis in the synoptic Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-but it is not the emphasis in the Gospel of John. What, then, is the emphasis concerning the Lord&#8217;s death in the Gospel of John? Not many Christians can answer this question.<p>If the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery were to try to answer this question regarding the purpose of the Lord&#8217;s death in the Gospel of John, they may give different answers. Some may say that the Lord died to enlarge Himself as God&#8217;s dwelling place, that He died to glorify Himself or to release the divine life from within Himself, or that He died to become the life-giving Spirit. Such answers, although somewhat close to the truth, may be according to the doctrines the saints have learned in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<h2 class=head2>A Bird&#8217;s-eye View</h2><p>If we would understand the emphasis in the Gospel of John concerning the death of Christ, we need to have a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the entire Gospel. The twenty-one chapters of this Gospel are very well arranged in sections. In the first eleven chapters we have a number of cases. The Lord Jesus did many miracles or signs. John selected some of these miraculous cases and used them in his Gospel to signify that the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, is adequate to meet the need of every person. No matter what our need may be, no matter what our case may be, the Lord Jesus is able to meet our need and take care of our case.<p>As we have pointed out, the cases selected by John begin with regeneration and end with resurrection. The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection. In principle, regeneration and resurrection are the same. On the one hand, apart from resurrection no one can be regenerated; on the other hand, regeneration is related to resurrection. All the cases found in the first eleven chapters of this Gospel are in the principle of regeneration by resurrection. Actually, all these cases involve the problem of death. These cases reveal that the Lord Jesus is fully qualified and adequate to meet all the needs of those in death. He is the unique One who can meet these needs because only He can impart the divine life into people in order to resurrect them and thereby regenerate them.<p>The raising of Lazarus stirred up the people. They heard that a Nazarene had resurrected a man who had been in the tomb for four days. No doubt, that was a great miracle, a miracle of miracles. John 12:17 and 18 say, &#8220;The crowd testified therefore, that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead. For this reason also the crowd went and met Him, because they heard that he had done this sign.&#8221; The crowd was excited and gave the Lord Jesus an enthusiastic welcome when He came into Jerusalem. Even when certain Greeks heard about the Lord, they wanted to see Him (12:20-21). Philip and Andrew came to the Lord and told Him about the desire of these Greeks to see Him. To Philip and Andrew, this was a golden time for the Lord.<p>If we had been in the Lord&#8217;s place in chapter twelve of John, we probably would have said, &#8220;How wonderful that the people are welcoming Me. This is the golden time for Me to be exalted.&#8221; However, according to verses 23 and 24 the Lord responded in a very different way: &#8220;Jesus answered them saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; I doubt that Philip and Andrew understood what the Lord was saying. Perhaps they thought that when the Lord used the word &#8220;glorified&#8221; He was saying that He would be exalted. But then the Lord went on to tell them that He would fall into the ground and die as a grain of wheat. This word may have been a disappointment to these disciples. The Lord indicated to them that He would not accept the welcome of the crowd. Instead, He would fall into the ground and die in order that He might be multiplied. If we see this, then we shall know the answer to the question concerning what aspect of Christ&#8217;s death is emphasized in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head2>Multiplication</h2><p>In John&#8217;s Gospel the emphasis regarding the Lord&#8217;s death is not redemption; John&#8217;s emphasis is multiplication. As we pointed out in foregoing messages, this multiplication, revealed in 12:24, is the Lord&#8217;s glorification. The Lord Jesus was God incarnate, God in the flesh. The Lord&#8217;s divine life with His divine nature was concealed in the flesh and confined by it. As such a One, He had come for a single purpose-to reproduce Himself, to have Himself multiplied, through death and resurrection.<p>This multiplication can be illustrated by a grain of wheat. Life is confined and concealed within the grain. How can a grain of wheat be multiplied? How can the life within it be released in order to produce an increase of the grain? The only way is for the grain of wheat to fall into the earth and die. The Lord used this illustration, taken from the realm of nature, to show the purpose of His death. Referring to Himself as a grain of wheat, the Lord indicated to His disciples that He came to be multiplied, to be reproduced, as a grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies and then grows up to produce many grains.<p>In chapter one of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the Lord as the Lamb of God, and in chapter twelve we see Him as a grain of wheat. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; The Lamb of God is for redemption, for taking away sin from the world. But a grain of wheat is for the releasing of life so that the one grain may be multiplied into many grains. Now we can see that, whereas the Lamb of God is for redemption, the grain of wheat is for multiplication. The multiplication of the grain is its glorification.<p>If a grain of wheat remained alone and did not fall into the earth to die, it could never be multiplied or glorified. But after a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it eventually will grow up to be multiplied. Through this multiplication, one grain brings forth many grains. This multiplication of a grain is also its glorification. A field of ripe wheat has a certain kind of glory. All the ripe ears of wheat are the glory of the grains of wheat that has been sown into the ground. Therefore, the multiplication of a grain of wheat is its glorification.<p>The Lord&#8217;s divinity and divine life were confined within the shell of His humanity. Hence, it was necessary for this shell to be broken so that the divinity and the life confined and concealed within it might be released and multiplied. For this purpose, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died there.<p>The truth concerning the Lord&#8217;s death for multiplication is much neglected by Christians today. All Christians realize that the Lord&#8217;s death has accomplished redemption. It is wonderful to realize this, but this realization is not adequate. The Lord&#8217;s death was not only for redemption, but was also for multiplication. The Gospel of John is not focused on redemption; rather, this Gospel is focused on multiplication.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Desire to Make His Chosen People His Reproduction</h2><p>As a whole, John&#8217;s Gospel reveals that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His chosen people to make them His reproduction. This reproduction is illustrated by a grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and grows in order to be multiplied. The many grains brought forth by the one grain are the multiplication of that grain.<p>A father is one who multiplies himself through the begetting of children. A man&#8217;s children are his multiplication and reproduction. In the same principle, as children of God, we are God&#8217;s reproduction. Concerning this, 1:12 and 13 say, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name; who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; According to these verses, whoever receives the one who came as God incarnate and tabernacled among us will be given the authority to become a child of God, His reproduction. As a result of the coming of the Lord Jesus, millions of children of God have been produced.<p>We have seen that the Gospel of John does not emphasize the redemption of the Lord Jesus, but instead emphasizes the multiplication brought forth by the Son of God. According to 12:24, the Lord brought forth this reproduction by falling into the ground as a grain of wheat to die. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to bring forth the multiplication, the reproduction, of Himself. According to the synoptic Gospels Christ died for redemption, but according to the emphasis in John&#8217;s Gospel, He died for the purpose of multiplication.<h2 class=head2>Divine Glorification</h2><p>We have seen that after the resurrection of Lazarus, the crowd welcomed the Lord Jesus and wanted to exalt Him. However, the Lord did not come for human exaltation; He came instead for divine glorification. This glorification required Him to pass through the process of death and resurrection. The five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen are all on one subject-the glorification of the Lord Jesus. What is the Lord&#8217;s glorification? His glorification is His multiplication. From 12:23 to the end of chapter seventeen we see that Jesus, the Nazarene, had to pass through death so that He might be multiplied in His resurrection. This multiplication is His glorification.<p>Suppose a certain brother has twelve sons. These sons would be the brother&#8217;s multiplication and glorification. If we saw this brother surrounded by all his sons, we would realize that with him there is multiplication, and that this multiplication is his glorification.<p>The matter of multiplication as glorification revealed in chapters twelve through seventeen has been neglected by Christians throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, these chapters definitely speak of the Lord&#8217;s glorification. When the people wanted to exalt Him, the Lord said, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified&#8221; (12:23). In order for the Son of Man to be glorified, it was necessary for Him to die and be multiplied. In 12:28, the Lord Jesus went on to pray, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; For the Father to glorify His name is for Him to glorify Himself, for the Father&#8217;s name denotes His Person. Then in 12:32 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&#8221; For the Lord to be &#8220;lifted up&#8221; means that He was put on the cross. When He was lifted up, He drew all men to Himself. All those who have been drawn to Him are His multiplication.<h2 class=head2>The Judgment of This World</h2><p>Concerning the Lord&#8217;s death, 12:31 says, &#8220;Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.&#8221; This verse indicates that through the Lord&#8217;s death the world, the anti-God system of Satan, has been judged and also indicates that the ruler of this world has been cast out.<p>In chapter twelve of John we do not have the thought of redemption. Instead, this chapter speaks concerning multiplication, the drawing of all men to the Lord, the judgment of the world, and the casting out of the ruler of this world. In order for all men to be drawn to the Lord so that He might be multiplied, it was necessary for the world system, which usurps mankind, to be judged. Fallen mankind is under the tyranny, the usurpation, of the world, just as the children of Israel were under the tyranny and usurpation of Pharaoh in Egypt. After God judged Egypt and Pharaoh, Pharaoh let the children of Israel go. Likewise, the world, which usurps the children of God, has been judged. When the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, the world was judged. This is the reason Paul could say, &#8220;The world has been crucified to me and I to the world&#8221; (Gal. 6:14). This makes it possible for God&#8217;s chosen people to be released from the world. Furthermore, the ruler of this world has been cast out. In the sight of God and in the sight of the angels, demons, and Satan, this world has been judged, condemned, and its ruler has been cast out. Therefore, the world and its ruler, Satan, are powerless to hold us.<h2 class=head2>Realizing That We Are Christ&#8217;s Glorification</h2><p>Through the Lord&#8217;s death the divine life within Him was released. Then in resurrection He imparted this life to God&#8217;s chosen people. In this way God&#8217;s people have become His multiplication, a multiplication which is His glorification.<p>No one in history has been glorified in such a way as the Lord Jesus. Today there are Christians all over the world. Even though many believers are weak, it cannot be denied that Christians are Christ&#8217;s multiplication and glorification.<p>Unfortunately, many believers do not realize that they are Christ&#8217;s glorification. Have you ever realized that you are a part of Christ&#8217;s glorification? Probably you have not realized this. Perhaps your understanding of Christ&#8217;s death has been according to traditional teaching. Most of the biblical truths, including the truth concerning redemption, have been leavened. As a result, very few Christians know the truth in a complete and pure way. On the contrary, nearly every truth has been leavened, reduced, and covered. Therefore, I hope that we all shall see that the Lord&#8217;s death was not only for redemption, but was also for His glorification through multiplication. We are His multiplication, and as His multiplication we are His glorification.<p>After the Lord predicted His glorification, He went on to give a lengthy message concerning it, a message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. In chapter fourteen we have the Father&#8217;s house; in chapter fifteen, the vine with all its branches; and in chapter sixteen, the newborn man. The Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man are all the result of Christ&#8217;s multiplication; they are the issue of His reproduction. As we have pointed out in previous messages, the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man are the Lord&#8217;s glorification. Therefore, in 17:1 He prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This means that in chapter seventeen the Lord prayed for His multiplication, which would be the issue, the result, of His death. As a grain of wheat, He fell into the ground and died, and then He rose up to become many grains. Now these grains have become the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man for His expression. This, therefore, is the purpose of Christ&#8217;s death unfolded in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S BOLDNESS IN PRESENTING HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH</h2><p>After praying for His glorification, the Lord presented Himself in chapter eighteen to be arrested, tried, judged, and put to death. The Lord Jesus boldly presented Himself for death. He knew where He would be arrested. In chapter thirteen the Lord even encouraged Judas. He told the disciples that one of them would betray Him. Then He gave a morsel to the betrayer, to Judas, and said to him, &#8220;What you do, do more quickly&#8221; (13:27). After Judas took the morsel and went out, the Lord again spoke concerning His glorification: &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately&#8221; (vv. 31-32). The Lord Jesus certainly knew that the time had come for Him to be put to death. However, He spoke not of being put to death, but of being glorified. His word in 13:31-32 corresponds to His prayer in chapter seventeen, the prayer that the Father might glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him. To glorify the Son actually means to put the Son to death. Hence, by praying for His glorification the Lord was praying concerning His death.<p>John 18:1 says, &#8220;When Jesus said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered and His disciples.&#8221; The Lord delivered Himself of His own accord to the process of death, as He mentioned in 10:17-18. He did this voluntarily and boldly. He went to the garden where He knew that He would be betrayed. For what purpose was He betrayed? He was betrayed in order that He might be put to death so that He might be multiplied. May we all have a clear vision concerning this.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 18:1-40; 12:23-24</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the content of chapter eighteen of the Gospel of John. In order to understand this chapter, it would be helpful to compare it with the chapters in the synoptic Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-that speak of the Lord in Gethsemane and of His arrest, trial, and judgment. If you make such a comparison you will see that the synoptic Gospels emphasize aspects that are different from those emphasized in John 18. Only in John are we told that Judas, the one who betrayed Him, knew the place where the Lord Jesus would be (18:2). In John 18 we also see that Judas brought a band of soldiers and deputies with weapons to seize the Lord and arrest Him (v. 3).<h2 class=head1>THE I AM</h2><p>In chapter eighteen we see that the Lord Jesus was bold. With boldness He went to the garden, and with boldness He met those who came to arrest Him. Verse 4 says, &#8220;Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?&#8221; When they answered that they were seeking Jesus the Nazarene, He said to them, &#8220;I am&#8221; (v. 5). Verse 6 says, &#8220;When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground.&#8221;<p>&#8220;I am&#8221; is the name of Jehovah. In verses 5, 6, and 8 this name is used three times. One reason this name is used here is that John&#8217;s record is to show us how Jehovah, the Triune God, works Himself into His chosen people. The One who was arrested was not merely a Nazarene; this One was the great I Am, the unlimited, infinite God. Hence, the One who was arrested was Jehovah God. With one who is merely a Nazarene there is not the divine life. But the great I Am has the divine life. Therefore, Jesus is not merely a man; He is also I Am. According to 1:1, He was the Word, and the Word was God. What is the name of this One? His name is I Am; His name is Jehovah.<p>As we read John 18, we see that the emphasis of the record here is certainly different from that in the other Gospels. The synoptic Gospels reveal that Jesus was arrested as a man and then put on the cross to die for our sins in order to accomplish redemption for us. The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus is the great I Am.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S WILLINGNESS TO BE PUT TO DEATH</h2><p>Furthermore, according to John&#8217;s Gospel, the One who was arrested in the garden was the Lamb of God, but even more He was a grain of wheat (12:24). As a grain of wheat, a container of the divine life, the Lord was arrested and then sown into the earth through death in order that He might be multiplied and thereby be glorified.<p>The Lord Jesus was willing to be put to death in order that He might be glorified. He knew that under God&#8217;s hand His being arrested and being put to death were the answer to His prayer in 17:1. In that verse He prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; It was by His being put to death that the Lord would be glorified.<p>In order for this glorification to take place, the Lord went to the very spot where He would be arrested. Actually, the Lord was not arrested by the soldiers; He presented Himself to them. In order to avoid being arrested, it would not have been necessary for the Lord to call the angels to fight for Him. He simply had to say the words, &#8220;I Am.&#8221; We have seen that when He said these words, the soldiers drew back and fell to the ground. Here the Lord was not threatening them; instead, He was comforting them. The Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;Are you seeking Jesus the Nazarene? I Am. Have you come to arrest Jehovah? There is no need for you to arrest Me. I present Myself to you. Take Me to the place where I shall be put to death.&#8221;<p>This understanding of the Lord&#8217;s action matches His word in 10:17 and 18 concerning Himself as the good Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep: &#8220;I lay down My life that I may take it again. No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.&#8221; Here we see that no one took the Lord&#8217;s life away from Him. Rather, He laid it down of His own accord and then, after a short period of time (three days according to the Jewish calendar), He took up His life again. Therefore, in this sense the Lord actually was not arrested and taken away; on the contrary, He gave Himself away and then, three days later, He took Himself back.<p>For what purpose did the Lord give Himself to those who betrayed Him, arrested Him, judged Him, and sent Him to be put to death? The Lord&#8217;s purpose in giving Himself up was that He would be multiplied. The Lord willingly went through the process of death so that He could be multiplied.<h2 class=head1>THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE PROCESS OF DEATH</h2><p>In order for the Lord to pass through the process of death, it was necessary for everything and everyone involved in this process to be prepared. Judas, Peter, the high priest, and Pilate all had a part in this process. Judas betrayed the Lord, and Peter, bold in the flesh to resist, first cut off the ear of a slave of the high priest and later denied the Lord. The Jewish high priest judged the Lord and rejected Him. After this rejection, He was transferred by the Jewish religionists to Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate had no way to condemn the Lord, but he was forced by the people to do something. With Judas, Peter, the high priest, and Pilate we see certain steps that were a necessary preparation for the process of death through which the Lord Jesus, the great I Am, passed.<p>Not long before the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, the Roman Empire adopted crucifixion as a method of executing criminals. No doubt, it was sovereign of God that the Roman Empire adopted this method of executing criminals before the Lord was tried and sentenced to death. In the Old Testament it was prophesied definitely that the Messiah was to be cut off, crucified. In John 12 the Lord Jesus also prophesied that He would be lifted up, that is, crucified. However, the Jewish way of executing criminals convicted of a capital offense was stoning. Therefore, in order for the prophecies concerning the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion to be fulfilled, it was necessary for Him to be transferred from the Jewish authorities to the authority of the Roman rulers.<p>Moreover, according to Roman law, the Jews were not allowed to execute criminals. Concerning this, John 18:31 says, &#8220;Pilate said then to them, You take him and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.&#8221; According to the next verse, this took place so that &#8220;the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying what kind of death He was about to die.&#8221; Therefore, the matter of executing the Lord Jesus was left to Pilate. The transfer of the Lord Jesus from the Jewish religionists to the Roman rulers led to the death of the cross.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEFORE PILATE</h2><h2 class=head2>The King of the Kingdom of God</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was before Pilate, Pilate actually did not judge Him. Instead, Pilate held a conversation with the Lord. In this conversation certain marvelous things were manifested. First, Jesus was manifested to be the King of the kingdom of God. The Jews had mocked the Lord Jesus by saying that He was the King. When Pilate heard of their mocking word, he questioned the Lord concerning His being a King. In 18:37 Pilate said to Him, &#8220;Are you then a king?&#8221; The Lord answered, &#8220;You are saying that I am a king.&#8221; Immediately before Pilate asked Him about being a king, the Lord had said to him, &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My deputies would have fought that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from this world&#8221; (v. 36). The Gospel of John is the only Gospel that records this aspect of the conversation between Pilate and the Lord Jesus. The reason John&#8217;s Gospel includes this is that his Gospel reveals that the One who was about to be crucified is the great I Am and the King of the kingdom of God. The One who stood before Pilate was not merely Jesus the Nazarene. This One was Jehovah, the I Am. He was the King of the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head2>A Witness to the Truth</h2><p>In the presence of Pilate the Lord Jesus was also manifested as a witness to the truth. He said to Pilate, &#8220;For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice&#8221; (v. 37). To this, Pilate replied, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221; (v. 38).<p>Concerning truth, or reality, we have seen that the entire universe may be compared to a shell and that the content of this shell is the Triune God. As created human beings, we also are shells, empty containers. We need God to be our content, to be our reality. The Triune God is the reality in the universe, and the Lord Jesus came to testify concerning this reality. This Gospel reveals that God is the truth, the reality, and the Spirit is the Spirit of reality. Every word that conveys the Triune God is also truth or reality. Truth, then, is the divine Trinity as the content of the universe and of God&#8217;s chosen people.<p>The Lord Jesus indicated to Pilate that He came as the King of the kingdom of God and also came to testify to the truth. For the Lord to testify to the truth means that He testified that the Triune God is the real content of the universe.<p>Pilate did not understand, and there was no time for the Lord Jesus to tell him any more. Pilate abruptly ended the conversation by saying, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221;<h2 class=head2>Proved to Be without Fault</h2><p>As soon as Pilate ended his conversation with the Lord Jesus, he went out to the Jews and said to them, &#8220;I find no fault whatever in him&#8221; (v. 38b). In the Lord&#8217;s trial before Pilate there was not actually any judgment. Instead, there was a manifestation of the Lord as the King of the kingdom of God and as the living witness to the truth, the universal reality. Furthermore, He was proved to be without fault. He was perfect and was not wrong in anything. Nevertheless, as we shall see in chapter nineteen, they put the Lord Jesus to death.<h2 class=head1>DEATH FOR MULTIPLICATION AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Chapter eighteen is a record of the preparation of the great I Am to pass through the process of death for the purpose of multiplication and glorification. We have seen that the emphasis with respect to the Lord&#8217;s death in John&#8217;s Gospel is on multiplication rather than redemption. The Lord died so that He as the one grain might become many grains in resurrection. This multiplication makes it possible for the Father to have a house with many abodes, for the Son to have many brothers, for the vine to spread through its many branches, and for the new man with its many parts to be born. The first man, Adam, was created by God. But the second man was not created; rather, the second man was begotten, produced, through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. The result of Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection is multiplication, and this multiplication is the Lord&#8217;s glorification.<p>When the Lord Jesus was speaking concerning Himself as the true vine, He said to His disciples, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (15:5). Concerning this fruit-bearing, the Lord went on to say, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples&#8221; (v. 8). Here we see that when the branches of the vine bear fruit, the Father is glorified.<p>The principle is the same with the grain of wheat in 12:24. The one grain fell into the ground and died and then grew up to become many grains. This multiplication of the one grain is the glorification of that grain. In 12:23 and 24, we see the glorification of the Son. The Son&#8217;s glorification issues in the Father&#8217;s glorification because the Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification. Now we need to see that this glorification is a matter of multiplication, and this multiplication has not ceased.<p>The multiplication is continuing through the fruit-bearing of the many branches of the vine. Christ is the vine, and we are the branches. These branches are actually the many grains produced by the Lord as the one grain. At first, the Lord Jesus was the only grain. Then He was multiplied through death and resurrection to produce many grains. Now we, those who believe in Christ, are the many grains and also the many branches of the vine. As branches, we are destined to bear fruit. This fruit-bearing is also multiplication, and this multiplication is the continuation of the Lord&#8217;s glorification.<p>In the synoptic Gospels the Lord commands the disciples to go forth and preach the gospel to disciple the nations. In Matthew 28:19 He says, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&#8221;; in Mark 16:15, &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation&#8221;; and in Luke 24:47 He says that &#8220;repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations.&#8221; However, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus does not charge us to go forth to preach the gospel in order to win souls. What we have in this Gospel is not gospel preaching but fruit-bearing.<p>Many in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are expecting to see more increase. In the divine economy the increase does not come mainly from gospel preaching. Rather, the real increase comes as the result, the issue, of death. As we have pointed out, in chapter twelve there was a golden opportunity for the Lord to be exalted and to have a large crowd following Him. That is the kind of increase valued by many Christians today. Certain preachers enjoy drawing a crowd and having a big following. But according to John 12 to have a crowd follow Him is not the Lord&#8217;s way to have His increase. His way is to be multiplied through death. This applies also to us. We may think that the increase will come through gospel preaching. Although I am certainly for the preaching of the gospel, I must tell you that the real increase comes through death. If we want there to be an increase in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we need to die. For the increase, we need to be put to death.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEATH PROCESS</h2><p>Because we are not willing to die, God in His sovereignty prepares everyone and everything necessary to bring us into death. He may prepare a &#8220;Judas&#8221; to betray you and a good-hearted &#8220;Peter,&#8221; who may think that he is helping you by defending you. We know that Peter only caused trouble for the Lord Jesus by cutting off the ear of the slave of the high priest. One of the other Gospels records the fact that it was necessary for the Lord to heal the slave&#8217;s ear. The &#8220;Peters&#8221; who think they are helping us may actually be used to bring us into death. God has a way to do this.<p>Some of us had the concept that if we loved the Lord and took His way in the recovery, everything related to us would be flourishing. We expected to have a good wife or husband and children who were obedient and would eventually become successful in their professions. However, many of us can testify that the more we love the Lord and take His way, the more troubles we have. The Lord may prepare someone to betray us and others, like the high priest, to reject us. There may even be a &#8220;Pilate&#8221; who will deliver us to those who intend to crucify us. All these things are prepared by God and make it possible for us to go through the process of death. Therefore, instead of a good environment, the situation may be the exact opposite of what we expected.<p>The reason for this is that everything works together to help us go through the death process. According to Romans 8:28, God causes all things to work together for good. But they work together according to God&#8217;s understanding of matters, not according to our own understanding. When we quote Romans 8:28, we should not forget the context of this chapter. This chapter speaks of suffering upon suffering. Nevertheless, God causes all things to work together for good in that we are prepared to pass through the process of death.<p>Apparently, after the Lord Jesus came to the garden, nothing was good. Actually, everything was good, because everything was a preparation for the death process. Within a short period of time after coming to the garden, He entered into that process. Judas&#8217; betrayal, Peter&#8217;s resistance, the high priest&#8217;s rejection, and Pilate&#8217;s judgment were all helpful in this regard. All these things contributed to the process by which the Lord Jesus entered into death. But He was ready for this, for He was ready to be sown as a grain of wheat so that through death and resurrection He might be multiplied.<p>My burden in these messages on chapter eighteen is to point out that according to the emphasis in the Gospel of John, the Lord&#8217;s death was mainly for multiplication. Now this multiplication should continue with us. As the many grains produced by the one grain, we are the branches of the vine to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father. Our fruit-bearing is the continuation of the multiplication, of the divine glorification. This fruit-bearing cannot be prevailing unless we are willing to pass through the death process.<p>In nature we see that in order to bear fruit many kinds of trees must pass through the &#8220;winter&#8221; of death. With us, if there is no death, there will be no fruit-bearing. First there must be death, and then resurrection will follow. In resurrection we have fruit-bearing.<p>The only way for the Lord to have His increase today is for us to be willing, as He was, to experience all the preparations for the death process. We should thank the Lord that with us also there is the necessary preparation. There may be a Judas, a Peter, religion&#8217;s opposition and rejection, and a trial before the rulers. All these preparations form a process of death for us to go through. If we go through this process, the Lord&#8217;s multiplication, His glorification, will continue. This multiplication, this glorification, this increase, will be repeated again and again through the process of death. This is the Lord&#8217;s death for reproduction, for multiplication, which is His glorification.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 19:1-42</h1><p>Although chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, we may not see the reality in this chapter. This chapter is full of rich extracts. In this message and in the message following we shall consider twelve major points with a number of subpoints, all of which are related to the extracts of this deep and rich section of the Word.<p>Our concern in these messages is to present not the facts but the extracts. In giving this message I assume that you have at least a general knowledge of the content of this chapter. Let us, then, now consider the major points, the signs, in John 19.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF A THORN CROWN AND A PURPLE GARMENT</h2><p>The sign of a thorn crown and a purple garment signifies the rejected Messiah, or King, of the Jews. This sign is important because the entire chapter is on the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.<p>In this chapter first we see who the Lord is. He is the Messiah, the anointed One of God. This term denoted the King of God&#8217;s people. Hence, the One who was crucified was not a common man, a common figure. On the contrary, He was the One anointed of God, the One whom God had anointed to be the King of His people. Although God had anointed Him, the people rejected Him. They rejected their King, the very One whom they had been expecting for centuries. Even as they were rejecting Him, they were still expecting the coming of their Messiah.<p>John 19:1 and 2 say: &#8220;Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him. And the soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment.&#8221; This was done as a mockery. Both the thorn crown and the purple garment signify kingship. A crown, of course, is worn by a king, and the color purple signifies kingly honor. Even this mockery of the Lord Jesus was according to the sovereignty of God. The sign of the thorn crown and the purple garment signifies Christ&#8217;s kingship.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Verse 17 says, &#8220;And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.&#8221; In this verse we have the cross as a sign. Many Christians think that the cross is primarily a matter of suffering. According to their understanding, to bear the cross is to suffer. Some of us may still hold to this traditional thought. Concerning this, the well-known book, The Imitation of Christ, has exercised a great influence. Because this book matches the natural concept, I valued it very highly when I was young. I, too, regarded the cross as being a matter of suffering. When I spoke concerning the cross many years ago, I sometimes told the saints that if they were suffering in their circumstances, they were experiencing the cross. If a brother&#8217;s wife gave him a difficult time, in this situation he was bearing the cross. The point we are making here is that according to our natural concept, the cross is a matter of suffering.<p>However, according to the facts of history, it was not the purpose of the cross to cause suffering; instead, the cross was for terminating people. When someone was put on the cross, the purpose was to terminate him. This is clearly the meaning of the cross in John 19. Verse 15 indicates this: &#8220;They cried out then, Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&#8221; This verse indicates that for the Lord to be crucified, to be put on the cross, is for Him to be terminated. The cross, therefore, is not for suffering; it is for termination.<p>We need to realize that the special significance of the cross in this chapter is that the cross terminates the old creation. It terminates the things, the matters, and the people of the old creation, all of which are contrary to God&#8217;s purpose. Anything that is against the purpose of God needs to be terminated. In God&#8217;s economy this termination is accomplished by the death of the cross.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE TITLE WRITTEN IN HEBREW, LATIN, AND GREEK</h2><p>John 19:19 and 20 say, &#8220;Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS....and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.&#8221; This also was done according to God&#8217;s sovereignty. The chief priests said to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write, the King of the Jews, but that that man said, I am King of the Jews&#8221; (v. 21). To this Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written, I have written&#8221; (v. 22). Actually, what Pilate wrote was not of himself, but was of God&#8217;s sovereignty. The title written by Pilate declared the fact that the Lord Jesus is the King of the Jews.<p>It is also significant that this title was written in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Hebrew represents Hebrew religion, Latin represents Roman politics, and Greek represents Greek culture. These three together represent the entire world, all of mankind. This signifies that the Lord Jesus was killed by and for all mankind. Not long after the Lord&#8217;s death, certain Jews, Romans, and Greeks were saved. The Lord Jesus was put to death for the entire human race as represented by these three languages. Therefore, the title written by Pilate is a sign.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE TWO CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</h2><p>John 19:18 says that &#8220;they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.&#8221; Here we have the sign of the two crucified with Christ, one on each side of Him. The Gospel of Luke also speaks of this, telling us, &#8220;There were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death....they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left&#8221; (Luke 23:32-33). The record in Luke regarding this point serves a different purpose from the purpose in John&#8217;s record. Luke&#8217;s purpose is to show that these malefactors were sinners and that the Lord Jesus is the Savior. But it is not John&#8217;s intention to show sinners and the Savior. Instead, his intention is to show the separation of life and death.<p>The crucified Christ is a dividing factor of death and life. On one side of Him there was death; on the other side there was life. Whether we are in death or in life depends on our relation to this crucified One. This is the significance in John of the Lord Jesus being crucified between two others.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE SEAMLESS TUNIC</h2><p>In 19:23 and 24 we have the sign of the seamless tunic: &#8220;The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.&#8221; The other Gospels also include a record of the soldiers dividing the Lord&#8217;s garments. But only the Gospel of John speaks of the seamless tunic. The seamless tunic signifies that the crucified One was perfect in His conduct. With Him there was no sin, no defect. As indicated by His seamless tunic, His conduct was absolutely perfect.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE FIFTH WORD SPOKEN BY THE LORD ON THE CROSS</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He spoke seven words. Three of these words are recorded in chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John; the other four are recorded in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. If we study this matter, we shall see the difference between the words recorded in the Gospel of John and those recorded in the other Gospels. The four words recorded in the synoptic Gospels are recorded for the purpose of indicating redemption. Before we consider the sign of the fourth word spoken by the Lord Jesus, let us consider the words recorded in the synoptic Gospels.<p>In Luke 23:34 we have the first of the words spoken by the Lord on the cross: &#8220;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#8221; This word is a prayer offered for sinners. The second word uttered by the Lord was, &#8220;To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise&#8221; (Luke 23:43). The third was, &#8220;Woman, behold your son....Behold, your mother&#8221; (John 19:26-27). These three words were spoken during the first three hours of the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion. During the second period of three hours, He spoke four other words: &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; (Matt. 27:46); &#8220;I thirst&#8221; (John 19:28); &#8220;It is finished&#8221; (19:30); and, &#8220;Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit&#8221; (Luke 23:46).<p>As we consider these words, we see that those recorded in the synoptic Gospels indicate redemption. First, the Lord prayed that the Father would forgive sinners. Then He told the thief who believed in Him that he would be with Him in Paradise. This is a word of grace for salvation. When the Lord cried out concerning God&#8217;s forsaking Him, this was an indication that He was our Substitute bearing our sins. The seventh word, when the Lord committed His spirit into the hands of the Father, is also related to redemption.<p>The three words recorded in the Gospel of John, the third, the fifth, and the sixth, are related not mainly to redemption, but to the purpose of the Lord&#8217;s death emphasized in the Gospel of John. This is true with respect to the Lord&#8217;s word first to His mother and then to one of His disciples: &#8220;Woman, behold your son....Behold, your mother.&#8221; Many readers of this Gospel think that the Lord was simply telling the disciple to take care of His mother. However, there is a much deeper thought here. We need to find the extract of this word spoken by the Lord.<p>How could the Lord&#8217;s mother have one of His disciples as a son, and how could this disciple become the son of the Lord&#8217;s mother? This requires a union in life through the imparting of the divine life into the believers. It is by this life that the disciple could become one with Him and become the son of His mother, and she could become the mother of this disciple.<p>The deep significance of the Lord&#8217;s word here is that through His death the divine life within Him was released and imparted to His believers. Now through the life imparted to them the believers have an organic union with Him. Because the Lord&#8217;s disciples are one with Him in the divine life, His mother can become the mother of His disciple, and His disciple can become His mother&#8217;s son. The Lord&#8217;s word in 19:26 and 27 indicates the organic union through the impartation of resurrection life. The emphasis of this word is not on redemption; the emphasis is on the imparting of life. It is very important for us to see this.<p>Toward the end of His hours on the cross, when the Lord Jesus realized that everything was finished, He said, &#8220;I thirst&#8221; (19:28). This word indicates that while the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He was working. In this regard His death was different from that of any other person. Through His death the Lord did a great work. While this work was taking place, He did not drink anything. Usually one who is working faithfully will not want to drink anything until he is finished. When we are working desperately on a matter, we do not have the time to say, &#8220;I am thirsty, and I would like a drink. Would you please serve me a drink?&#8221; The Lord Jesus indicated His thirst and need of a drink because He knew that &#8220;all things had now been accomplished.&#8221;<p>John 19:29 and 30 say, &#8220;A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth. When Jesus then had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.&#8221; Those who offered the vinegar to the Lord were mocking Him.<p>At the beginning of the crucifixion, the Lord was offered wine to drink mingled with gall. But after He tasted it, He refused to drink it (Matt. 27:34). This wine mingled with gall and also with myrrh (Mark 15:23) was intended to be a stupefying draught. The Lord, however, would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. He was willing to suffer the pain. But at the end of His crucifixion, when His work was finished, He said that He was thirsty. When they mockingly served Him vinegar, He took it and then said, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221;<p>The Lord&#8217;s word, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; signifies that as the Lord Jesus was dying, He was working. For what was the Lord working in His death? On the cross He was working for three things: first, to accomplish redemption; second, to terminate the old creation; and third, to release His divine life so that by this life the new creation could be brought forth for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. It was necessary for sin and sins to be taken away, for the old creation to be terminated, and for the divine life to be released. Only through the release of the divine life would the new creation have a way to be brought forth. Redemption, termination, and the release of life all depended on the Lord&#8217;s death. Therefore, while the Lord was dying, He was working to accomplish these three things.<p>I was a seeking Christian for many years before I realized that the Lord Jesus was working while He was dying on the cross. One day I began to see that the hour of the Lord&#8217;s death was an hour for Him to work. Through this work He accomplished redemption, He terminated the old creation, and He released the divine life to produce the new creation. In the New Testament there are definite hints concerning these matters.<p>In chapters eighteen and nineteen of John we see that the Lord Jesus was not afraid of death. Through His death He accomplished a great work. The work accomplished through the Lord&#8217;s death was much greater than the creation of the universe.<p>We know that God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation. To be sure, the new creation is greater and more important than the old creation. In order to produce the old creation, it was only necessary for God to speak. When God desired a certain thing to come into existence, He simply spoke the word, and that thing came into being. The new creation, however, was not brought forth in this way. The new creation was produced through the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. It was not produced by the Lord&#8217;s speaking.<p>We need to be impressed with the difference between the producing of the old creation and the producing of the new creation. According to the record of Genesis 1, everything in the old creation was created by God&#8217;s speaking. God called things not being as being (Rom. 4:17). In the old creation God spoke everything into existence. The new creation, on the contrary, was not created by God&#8217;s speaking. The new creation was produced through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Through the working of the Lord in His death, the divine life within Him was released to produce the new creation. Therefore, as the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He did a marvelous work. For this reason, at the end He could declare, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; This word means that the Lord&#8217;s work in death was finished.<p>During the years I was with the Brethren, they emphasized very much this word of the Lord. In referring to the Lord&#8217;s word, &#8220;It is finished,&#8221; they emphasized that the Lord&#8217;s redemptive work was finished. I would never say that this understanding is wrong. It is certainly correct to apply this word to the accomplishment of redemption. However, this understanding is not complete. Many Bible teachers have not gone on to point out that through His death the Lord&#8217;s divine life was released from within Him. Furthermore, these teachers have not seen the imparting of the divine life into the Lord&#8217;s believers.<p>We have seen that there is an important difference between the Lord as the Lamb of God (1:29) and as the grain of wheat (12:24). As a grain of wheat, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died, not to accomplish redemption but to release the divine life so that this life may be imparted into us to produce many grains. As the Lamb of God, the Lord died to accomplish redemption. We need to be impressed with the fact that the death of the one grain of wheat is not for redemption; it is for reproduction, for propagation, through the release and impartation of life.<p>The Lord&#8217;s death has two main aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. These two aspects are signified by the blood and water that came out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side. Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins (Heb. 9:22) for the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, dealing with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-31). The Lord&#8217;s death, on the negative side, is to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the other Gospels is for the redemptive aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death. But John&#8217;s record is not only for the redemptive aspect, but also for the life-imparting aspect. The life-imparting aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death released the Lord&#8217;s divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all those who believe in Him and to whom His divine life is imparted. We have seen that this aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat, which fell into the ground to bring forth many grains for making the loaf-the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). This, therefore, is the life-propagating, life-multiplying, generating, and reproducing death.<p>Most Christians, including many Christian teachers, see only one aspect of Christ&#8217;s death, the redemptive aspect. Therefore, we need to see that the Lord&#8217;s death has two aspects: the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life impartation. Redemption is a procedure, but the imparting of life is the goal. If we see only the redemptive aspect of the Lord&#8217;s death, this means that we see the procedure but not the goal. The Lord&#8217;s death is not only for redemption, but also for life impartation. As the Lamb of God He died on the cross for our sins, and as the grain of wheat He died to release the divine life so that this life may be imparted into us to make us God&#8217;s new creation. While the Lord was dying on the cross, He accomplished this wonderful work. Then at the close of His crucifixion He could declare that this work was finished.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 19:1-42</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S BEHAVIOR IN PASSING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEATH</h2><p>If we pay attention to the details as we read this chapter, we shall see that from the time Pilate scourged the Lord Jesus until the time He stopped breathing and gave up the spirit, there was a process. As He passed through this process, the Lord behaved Himself in a way that is significant. His behavior in passing through the terrifying process of death is a sign that He is life and resurrection.<p>Using the present tense, the Lord said to Martha in 11:25, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; When I read this verse many years ago, I was bothered by the fact that the Lord Jesus put resurrection before life. Furthermore, He used the definite article before both life and resurrection. In this verse the Lord says that He is the resurrection and the life. Even before He was resurrected from among the dead, He already was resurrection. If we read chapter nineteen carefully, we shall see that the One who passed through the process of death was a person who is resurrection and life.<p>The fact that the Lord Jesus had no fear of death is an indication that He passed through the process of death as the One who Himself is resurrection and life. In chapter nineteen we cannot find any trace of the fear of death with the Lord Jesus. The reason He was not afraid of death is that He is resurrection. If He had been afraid of death, then He would no longer have been the resurrection and the life. Because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, in His behavior as described in John 19 there is nothing of the fear of death.<h2 class=head2>Willingly Suffering Pilate&#8217;s Scourging</h2><p>John 19:1 says, &#8220;Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him.&#8221; The Lord Jesus did not do anything to avoid Pilate&#8217;s scourging. He did not walk away or turn away. Instead, He willingly suffered this scourging. Because He is the resurrection and the life, death could not affect Him in any way.<h2 class=head2>Quietly Accepting the Insulting Mocking</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus had been scourged by Pilate, He was mocked by the soldiers: &#8220;The soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment. And they came to Him and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they slapped Him in the face&#8221; (vv. 2-3). The soldiers mocked the Lord Jesus when they put the thorn crown and the purple garment on Him, but He accepted their mocking.<p>We should not think that the Lord was weak in quietly accepting the insulting mocking of the soldiers. No, He certainly was not weak. Actually, He was strong. The fact that He could withstand this mocking indicates that He was strong. As the One who is the resurrection and the life, He could withstand this mocking.<h2 class=head2>Boldly Facing the Threat of Death</h2><p>According to 19:7, the Jews said to Pilate that according to their law the Lord Jesus deserved to die &#8220;because he made himself Son of God.&#8221; When Pilate heard this word, he was afraid and asked the Lord Jesus where He was from (vv. 8-9). Roman rulers were known to be superstitious and fearful of so-called gods and spirits. Hence, when Pilate was told about Jesus&#8217; being the Son of God, he was afraid and asked the Lord concerning His place of origin. However, the Lord Jesus did not answer him (v. 9). Pilate then said to the Lord, &#8220;You do not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?&#8221; (v. 10). Here Pilate was threatening the Lord with death. But not being afraid of this death threat, the Lord answered, &#8220;You would have no authority against Me in anything unless it were given you from above; therefore, he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin&#8221; (v. 11).<p>Here we see that because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He was bold in facing the threat of death. If we had been on trial before Pilate, we probably would have been fearful and said, &#8220;Sir, let me tell you that I&#8217;m an honest person. I would not do anything to damage you. I beg you to release me.&#8221; The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, was not at all afraid of offending Pilate.<h2 class=head2>Bearing the Cross without Rejection</h2><p>John 19:17 says, &#8220;And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus was forced to bear the cross Himself, He did not reject it, even though He had not slept the previous night and had not eaten anything. He did not protest, as we might have done, saying that He had done nothing wrong or complaining that He had to bear His own cross. The Lord behaved in such a way as to show His opposers and His disciples that He is the resurrection. In His behavior the Lord showed that as the One who is the resurrection, He could pass through the process of death without being afraid of anything.<h2 class=head2>Tolerating the Stripping Silently</h2><p>Those who were persecuting the Lord Jesus first took off His garments and then mockingly put a purple garment on Him. Later, they took off the purple garment and put His own garment on Him. Eventually, when the Lord was crucified, He was stripped of His garments (vv. 23-24). Silently He tolerated this stripping. Then after they nailed Him to the cross, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier (v. 23). But because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He did not have any reaction to being stripped of His garments.<h2 class=head2>Caring for His Mother While Undergoing Crucifixion</h2><p>Even while the Lord Jesus was suffering on the cross, He cared for His mother. &#8220;Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son. Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home&#8221; (vv. 26-27).<p>We also see the Lord&#8217;s care in the garden when He was arrested: &#8220;Jesus answered, I told you that I am; if therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away&#8221; (18:8). Even under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples. This reveals His easy manner in passing through the process of death. The principle is the same with His caring for His mother while He was undergoing crucifixion.<p>Once again we see that the Lord was not afraid of death or weak in the presence of death. He was bold, strong, and vigorous because He is the resurrection and the life.<h2 class=head2>Taking the Vinegar Offered to Him in Mockery</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I thirst,&#8221; He was given vinegar to drink (vv. 28-29). The vinegar was offered to Him in mockery. Nevertheless, the Lord took the vinegar that was offered to Him in this way.<p>Every aspect of the Lord&#8217;s behavior in this chapter indicates that He was strong, bold, and not afraid of death. He passed through death and overcame it, manifesting the fact that He is the resurrection and the life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF BLOOD AND WATER FLOWING OUT OF THE LORD&#8217;S PIERCED SIDE</h2><p>John 19:34 says, &#8220;One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.&#8221; Here we have the sign of the blood and water flowing out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side. The blood signifies redemption, which deals with sin for the purchase of the church. The water signifies the impartation of life, which deals with death for the producing of the church.<p>Because the Jews did not want the bodies of those crucified to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, they asked Pilate that their legs might be broken (v. 31). The soldiers came and broke the legs of the two who had been crucified with the Lord. But when they came to Him, they saw that He had already died. Then instead of breaking His legs, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear.<p>Some teachers have claimed that, medically speaking, the separation of blood and water here signified death. Perhaps this understanding is correct medically. Our concern, however, is with the real significance of this blood and water. The blood signifies that Christ accomplished our redemption by dying for our sins. The water signifies that the divine life flowed out of Him who died for us.<p>We have pointed out that blood is for redemption and for the purchase of the church and that the water is for life-imparting and for the producing of the church. We were fallen away from God, but through the blood of Jesus we have been brought back. Moreover, in addition to being fallen, we were dead. We were under both sin and death. Therefore, the Lord released His life to enliven us, to make us alive. In this way the problem of death is solved, and the church as the new creation is produced.<p>On the one hand, the church was bought by the Lord&#8217;s blood; on the other hand, the church was produced by His life, which He released and imparted to us. The Gospel of John is not mainly for redemption, but is mainly for life impartation so that we, sinners, may be regenerated and become the many grains that are blended together to form one loaf, the church.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE UNBROKEN BONES SIGNIFYING  THE LORD&#8217;S UNBREAKABLE RESURRECTION LIFE  FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>According to 19:33, the Lord&#8217;s legs were not broken. Verse 36 explains, &#8220;For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.&#8221; Here we have the sign of the unbroken bones signifying the Lord&#8217;s unbreakable resurrection life for the producing of the church.<p>In the synoptic Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-we do not have a record of the blood and water flowing out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side; neither do we have a record concerning the fact that the Lord&#8217;s bones were not broken. Why is it that these matters are recorded only in the Gospel of John? The answer is related to the fact that the blood and the water are concerned with the producing of the church. The Lord&#8217;s bones not being broken is also concerned with the producing of the church.<p>In order to understand why John points out that none of the Lord&#8217;s bones were broken, we need to consider the type in Genesis 2, where the word bone is mentioned for the first time in the Bible. Genesis 2:21 and 22 say, &#8220;And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, built he a woman, and brought her unto the man&#8221; (lit.). Here we see that the rib, the bone, taken out of Adam was built into a woman, Eve, Adam&#8217;s counterpart. Ephesians 5 indicates that this is a type of Christ producing the church. As Eve came out of the side of Adam, so the church comes out of the side of Christ.<p>The bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection life, which is unbreakable and which was released through His death. This unbreakable resurrection life is for the producing of the church, the spiritual Eve, the spiritual wife to match Christ.<p>When some hear that the bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the unbreakable resurrection life for the producing of the church, they may say, &#8220;Brother Lee, this kind of allegorization of the Scriptures is according to your imagination.&#8221; On the contrary, this teaching has a solid basis in the Scriptures.<p>John 3:29 says, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; Christ is the Bridegroom, and the church is His bride. How does Christ as the Bridegroom obtain His bride? The best way to answer this question is to refer to the clear type in the Old Testament. Ephesians 5 reveals that Adam producing Eve to be his wife is a type of Christ producing the church to be His counterpart.<p>Genesis 2:20 says, &#8220;Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.&#8221; The living creatures were brought to Adam, and he named them, but he did not find among them a counterpart. Therefore, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and then He took a rib and built a woman and brought her to him. When Adam saw the woman, he said, &#8220;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man&#8221; (Gen. 2:23).<p>As the last Adam, Christ obtained His wife in a similar way. He &#8220;slept&#8221; on the cross, and while He slept His side was pierced. The water that flowed out of His pierced side signifies His resurrection life, which is typified by the unbroken bone. By this unbreakable resurrection life the church is produced and built up. The church, then, is Christ&#8217;s Eve. It is in this way that Christ, the Bridegroom, gains His bride, the church.<p>We have emphasized the fact that John 12:24 reveals that Christ as a grain of wheat did not remain alone. Instead, He fell into the ground and died, and then He rose up to produce many grains. Where in the Gospel of John do we find the fulfillment of this verse? The fulfillment is in 19:34. Through the piercing of the Lord&#8217;s side to release the flow of His life the Lord&#8217;s word in 12:24 was fulfilled.<p>John 3:29 and 12:24, two great verses, have been fulfilled. The many grains have been produced to form the church, and the church is the bride to match the wonderful Christ as the Bridegroom. Only in the Gospel of John, not in Matthew, Mark, or Luke, do we see these mysterious divine matters. Here we have the depths of the truth in John&#8217;s Gospel, the extract of the divine record in this book.<p>We have seen that when the Lord was dying on the cross, He was working for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s purpose. Eventually, His work on the cross issued in the outflow of His resurrection life to produce us as the many grains and the many members to form His Body. The Lord&#8217;s Body is also His wife, His counterpart to match Him. The church as Christ&#8217;s counterpart, therefore, is produced through His death and by His resurrection life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE BINDING LINEN SIGNIFYING THE OLD CREATION TO BE BURIED WITH THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</h2><p>John 19:40 says that Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus &#8220;took then the body of Jesus and bound it in linen with the spices, as it is the custom of the Jews to bury.&#8221; This also is a sign. The binding of the Lord with linen signifies that the old creation was buried with the crucified Christ.<p>Suppose Joseph and Nicodemus only buried the Lord with the spices and did not bind the Lord&#8217;s body with linen. In that case, after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection nothing would have been left in the tomb. Then Peter and the other disciples, seeing the empty tomb, might have thought that someone had stolen His body. There would not have been a sign of His resurrection. But as we shall see more fully when we come to chapter twenty, the disciples saw in the tomb the linen cloths with which the Lord&#8217;s body had been bound. This caused them to realize that the Lord Jesus had resurrected from the dead. Even more important is the fact that the linen signifies the old creation, which was buried with the Lord Jesus and left in the tomb when He resurrected. I believe that this is the main significance of the Lord being bound with linen.<p>God is sovereign, and every matter related to the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion happened under God&#8217;s sovereignty. God even prepared Joseph and Nicodemus, honorable men, to bind Him with linen as a sign that the old creation was buried with the crucified Christ. When He was buried, He was not buried alone, but was buried with the old creation. When He was resurrected, He left the old creation, signified by the linen, in the tomb. Then He came forth as the Head of the new creation with the ability to impart His divine life, which had been released through His death, into His disciples. In this way, His disciples became His brothers (20:17). These many brothers are also the many grains for the Lord&#8217;s glorification. Therefore, the old linen was left in the tomb, and outside the tomb, in resurrection, we have the Lord, the elder Brother, and the many brothers forming the new creation. This new creation was made possible through the Lord&#8217;s marvelous all-inclusive death. Praise the Lord for what He accomplished through His all-inclusive death!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:1-31</h1><p>We come in this message to chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, a chapter concerned with resurrection. If we know the contents of this Gospel in the way of life, we shall realize that chapter twenty is a chapter of multiplication, a chapter of glorification. This multiplication for glorification was the goal of the Lord&#8217;s life on earth.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL GOD BECOMING A MAN</h2><p>The Gospel of John first reveals that Christ is God, the eternal God. &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221; (1:1). Christ&#8217;s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God, and He is God. Therefore, 1:2 emphasizes that He was in the beginning with God. As the eternal God, He is the One through whom everything came into being (1:3).<p>John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; This verse reveals that the Word, the eternal God, became incarnate. As this incarnate One, the Lord lived on earth among men for thirty-three and a half years. His human living is recorded in the first seventeen chapters of this Gospel. These chapters reveal the eternal God living a human life.<p>Whoever would imagine that God would become a man and live among men for thirty-three and a half years? Although this is beyond our imagining, the Gospel of John reveals that the very God, the eternal One and the Creator of the universe, became a real man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones. The name of this man was Jesus. As we read the Gospel of John, we see what wonderful things were done by Him and through Him as He lived as a man among men. Even though He was still the very God, He lived a genuine human life.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE LIFE PASSING THROUGH DEATH</h2><p>Chapters eighteen and nineteen of John&#8217;s Gospel are quite particular. In these chapters the Lord certainly did not behave Himself as an ordinary man. However, our understanding of these chapters may be natural. When we read John 18 and 19, we may sympathize with the Lord in a natural way and pity Him for all His sufferings. But in these chapters we do not have a picture of a pitiful situation-we have a portrait of a victorious Person. Therefore, in our reading of these chapters we should not feel sad and sympathize with the Lord. Instead, we need to see that these chapters are a record of the victory of Christ&#8217;s resurrection life. John 18 and 19 are an exhibition of the unbreakable resurrection life. In everything recorded in these chapters the Lord behaved Himself as the One who is the resurrection and the life (11:25). This wonderful Person is life, and in these chapters this life is exhibited.<p>In chapter nineteen this divine life passed through death. Death did everything to Him that it was able to do, but it had no way to conquer Him or hold Him down.<p>Let us review some of the details concerning how the Lord as the resurrection and the life behaved in the presence of death. After praying concerning His glorification, the Lord boldly went to the garden for the purpose of handing Himself over to death. He knew what would happen. He even encouraged Judas, the one who betrayed Him, to act more quickly (13:27). The Lord was ready to give Himself over to those who would put Him to death. Instead of trying to escape, He went to the garden knowing that there He would be arrested.<p>In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; Do you know what it means for the Lord to pray that the Father would glorify the Son? This prayer means that the Father should have the Son put to death. Hence, when He prayed for His glorification, the Lord actually prayed concerning His death.<p>After uttering this prayer, He boldly went to the garden to present Himself to those who would put Him to death. As we read chapter eighteen, we should not feel sorry for the Lord. On the contrary, we should realize that here we have a description of a victorious and glorious situation. In the events described in this chapter, life is exhibited.<p>We have pointed out that the Lord&#8217;s behavior in these chapters indicates that He was not at all afraid of death. For example, 18:4 says, &#8220;Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?&#8221; Here we see the expression of life, and life is not afraid of death. The Lord was ready to be taken by them. His one request was that they would let His disciples go: &#8220;If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away&#8221; (18:8). Even in the midst of that situation, the Lord cared for His disciples. The Lord exhibited Himself as life both to His opposers and to His disciples. According to the human concept, the things that were happening to Him were extremely negative. But He, as life, was not afraid of these things. What can death do to the One who is the resurrection and the life?<p>With this principle as the basis, we should read chapters eighteen and nineteen again. Then we shall see that every incident was an opportunity for life to be manifested and exhibited. According to these chapters, life was able to pass through the process of death. In chapter twenty we have the result of this process.<h2 class=head1>DEATH, RESURRECTION, MULTIPLICATION, AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p>In previous messages we pointed out that the Lord&#8217;s death was for His multiplication. To Him, death was not a termination; it was a multiplication. This means that for the Lord death was not an ending; rather, it was a new beginning. Apart from death, how could He have entered into resurrection? First there is death and then resurrection.<p>In 12:24 the Lord indicated that He as a grain of wheat would fall into the ground and die and then grow up to produce many grains. This is multiplication. Praise the Lord that after passing through the process of death described in chapters eighteen and nineteen, the Lord grew up in resurrection with His multiplication!<p>The Lord&#8217;s multiplication consists of His brothers. This was the reason the Lord told Mary Magdalene to go to His brothers (20:17). This means that through the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, the Lord&#8217;s timid disciples became His brothers.<p>We know that Peter took the lead to be timid. Peter denied that he was one of the Lord&#8217;s disciples: &#8220;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said then to him, Are you not also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not&#8221; (18:25). Peter certainly was timid. It seems that neither he nor the other disciples were worthy to be disciples, much less brothers of the Lord. Nevertheless, on the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, timid Simon Peter became a brother of the resurrected Christ.<p>It was the resurrected Christ who told Mary to go to His brothers. The Lord&#8217;s brothers are His multiplication, the result of His wonderful death. The Lord died as a grain of wheat, and in resurrection the result was that many grains were produced. Praise the Lord that all His disciples became His brothers in resurrection! This is the multiplication of the crucified Jesus and the resurrected Christ.<p>This multiplication is the glorification concerning which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17. Before He died, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son. Then in a short period of time, perhaps less than forty hours, this prayer was answered when in resurrection the Lord was multiplied and glorified.<p>Let us now go on to consider the signs in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK</h2><p>The first of the signs in John 20 is that of the first day of the week. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.&#8221; It is significant that the Lord was resurrected not on the last day of the week, but on the first day of the week. This day denotes a new beginning. In the Bible the first day of the week is also called the eighth day. After a week of seven days, we have the eighth day, which is the first day of the week. The Lord died during one week, and He was resurrected at the start of another week. Therefore, the first day of the week is a sign.<p>John 20 speaks of both the first day of the week and the eighth day (v. 26). We have seen that the first day is also called the eighth day. The first mention of the eighth day in the Scriptures is related to the circumcision of the children of Israel. God commanded them to be circumcised on the eighth day (Gen. 17:12). According to John 20, the second Lord&#8217;s Day after His resurrection was the eighth day.<p>The sign of the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. His resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age. In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him. Then on the first day of the week there was a new beginning with Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>Whereas the Lord&#8217;s death was a termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation. For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord&#8217;s Day, which is the first day of the week. This means that in resurrection we are in the eighth day, or the first day of the week. Elsewhere, the New Testament calls the first day of the week the Lord&#8217;s day (Rev. 1:10), for it was on this day that the Lord Jesus was resurrected to become the living Lord and to usher in a new beginning in resurrection.<h2 class=head1>EARLY IN THE MORNING</h2><p>In 20:1 we are told that Mary came to the tomb early in the morning. Here early morning is a sign signifying the freshness and brightness of life in resurrection. When you were saved and regenerated, did you not have the sense within of something fresh and bright? This is the sense of resurrection. Whenever we are in resurrection we have the sense of freshness and brightness of life.<p>Often my spirit stirs within me and causes me to rise up early in the morning. I can testify that when I rise up early, I sense the freshness and brightness of life in resurrection. No doubt, when Mary met the Lord and heard Him speaking to her, she had the sense of freshness and brightness. This is the significance of the sign of early morning.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF SISTER MARY THE MAGDALENE</h2><p>Perhaps you have never realized that in this chapter Mary the Magdalene is herself a sign. This sister signifies the ones who love the Lord and who seek the experience of Him.<p>In contrast to the sisters, the brothers are often satisfied with facts or doctrines. The sisters, however, care for experience. The reason the sisters pursue experience and the brothers are often satisfied with doctrine is that the sisters are much more emotional than the brothers. Usually, the brothers are more sober in mind than the sisters are. For example, when Mary broke the alabaster flask and anointed the Lord, she acted in a very emotional way (John 12:3-8). If she had been sober, as Judas was, she never would have done that. The one who was sober asked why the ointment was wasted, and why it was not sold for a certain amount of money. To a certain extent, this is an illustration of the soberness of the brothers.<p>Generally, it is the brothers who are sober and the sisters who are emotional. Some may say that Mary the Magdalene was foolish to go to the tomb early in the morning, while it was yet dark. It might have been only four o&#8217;clock in the morning when Mary arrived at the tomb. Those who are sober-minded in a natural way may have criticized her for her behavior.<p>When Mary saw that the stone was taken away from the tomb, &#8220;She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him&#8221; (20:2).<p>When Peter and the other disciple heard this, they came to the tomb and saw that it was empty. Moreover, they &#8220;beheld the linen cloths lying there, and the handkerchief which was on His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place apart&#8221; (vv. 6-7), and then believed that the Lord had risen from among the dead. After believing the fact of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, &#8220;the disciples therefore went away again to their own home&#8221; (v. 10). They had the fact of resurrection, but they had not met the resurrected One.<p>Unlike the brothers, Mary, an emotional sister, was not satisfied. She &#8220;stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb&#8221; (v. 11). Then she saw &#8220;two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.&#8221; Peter and John saw the linen cloths and the handkerchief, but this sister saw two angels.<p>Then she received further revelation, a definite word from the resurrected Christ Himself. Thinking that the resurrected Christ was the gardener, she said to Him, &#8220;If you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away&#8221; (v. 15). &#8220;Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni!&#8221; (v. 16). Like a lamb who knows the shepherd&#8217;s voice, she immediately recognized the voice of the Lord.<p>Mary wanted to cling to the Lord, but He did not allow it. &#8220;Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&#8221; (v. 17). Here the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;Do not touch Me in My freshness. The freshness of My resurrection must first be presented to the Father for His enjoyment. Mary, go tell My brothers that I ascend to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.&#8221;<p>The Lord&#8217;s word to Mary indicated that in resurrection His disciples had become the same as He insofar as they also were sons of God. On the day of His resurrection, the only begotten Son became the Firstborn (Rom. 8:29), and His disciples became His many brothers, the many sons of the Father (Heb. 2:10-11). Before that day, God had only one Son, the only begotten Son. But in Christ&#8217;s resurrection many sons were born. This means that the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was a great bringing forth, a delivery that saw the birth of millions of sons of God.<p>Acts 13:33 indicates that Christ was born in His resurrection as the firstborn Son of God. This was the reason God said to Him, &#8220;This day have I begotten thee.&#8221;<p>As we have seen, Christ was not the only one born in His resurrection; all His believers, including us, were born in His resurrection to be the sons of God. The disciples in John 20 are our representatives. Therefore, all of us are sons born of God in the resurrection of Christ. For this reason, 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.<p>Praise the Lord that when Jesus Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God, we all were born with Him! Mary was the first to receive the revelation of this, for she was not satisfied with the fact, but was seeking the experience of Christ. Hence, Mary Magdalene is a sign of those who love the Lord and seek to experience Him.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THE FACT</h2><p>We have already pointed out that whereas Mary was seeking the experience of the Lord, Peter and John were satisfied with the fact of the empty tomb. I wonder how Peter and John felt when Mary came to them with the report that she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken with her (v. 18). John may have said to Peter, &#8220;I wanted to linger at the tomb, but you urged me to go back. Didn&#8217;t I tell you that we should stay for a while?&#8221;<p>Many times the brothers are satisfied with the fact and do not linger to seek the experience of the Lord. Sometimes the brothers may even hinder certain saints from seeking the experience of the resurrected Christ. Brothers, we need to learn from this sign not to be satisfied with the mere fact or doctrine, but to seek the experience of the resurrected Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:1-31</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in chapter twenty in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE EMPTY TOMB</h2><p>In John 20 the empty tomb also is a sign (v. 2). There is a hymn concerning the empty tomb which indicates that when we see the empty tomb, we should be at rest, for the empty tomb is the sign that God has accepted our Redeemer, our Substitute. According to this hymn, the empty tomb implies that our sins have been forgiven and that our case has been solved before God. Therefore, we may be at peace.<p>However, this understanding of the significance of the empty tomb is too shallow. When we think of the empty tomb, we should not simply realize that our problems have been solved. On the positive side, we should realize that Christ is in resurrection and we also are in resurrection. In resurrection He became the Firstborn, and we became His brothers. Our sins have been forgiven, our problems have been solved, and we have been germinated. Now in resurrection we are part of the new creation. We are in Christ&#8217;s multiplication, and this multiplication is the church life. Do you know what the church life is? The church life is the glorification of Christ, a glorification which is actually Christ&#8217;s multiplication. Probably you have not realized before that in the church we are in the multiplication of Christ. The situation in the church is far from pitiful; the situation is one of glorification. Praise the Lord that the church life, as Christ&#8217;s glorification, is His multiplication!<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LINEN CLOTHS  AND THE HANDKERCHIEF</h2><p>The next sign is the sign of the linen cloths and the handkerchief (vv. 5-7). After the Lord Jesus was resurrected from the dead, something was left in the tomb. The linen cloths left in the tomb signify the old creation. These cloths and a handkerchief were used to wrap the Lord Jesus when He was buried. But in resurrection these things remained in the tomb. This gives us a clear picture that the old creation has been terminated, and the new creation is in resurrection.<p>Where are you today-in the tomb or in resurrection? Too often many Christians are in a tomb as far as their experience is concerned. The church life, however, is in resurrection. In the church life we should not have anything in the old creation. Whenever we come to a church meeting, we should be sure to leave everything of the old creation in the tomb. Because the church is altogether in resurrection, we should not bring anything of the old creation into the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S BROTHERS</h2><p>In verse 17 we have the sign of the Lord&#8217;s brothers: &#8220;Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&#8221; The sign of the Lord&#8217;s brothers signifies His multiplication as His glorification in resurrection. This is the crucial point in this chapter.<p>Recently in a meeting we sang the hymn, the first line of which is, &#8220;Christ the Lord is ris&#8217;n indeed.&#8221; Although this is a good hymn on the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, and everything in it is true, it is very objective. In this hymn we do not have anything concerning the multiplication and glorification of the Lord Jesus. This hymn says that Christ &#8220;has met His people&#8217;s need.&#8221; But what exactly is our need? In what matters do we need the Lord&#8217;s resurrection? We need to answer such questions according to our actual experience. One line of this hymn goes on to ask the question, &#8220;Where, O Death, is now thy sting?&#8221; Can we say that in our daily living we do not suffer from the sting of death? We must admit that in our practical experience death is still powerful. In our family life, for example, we may be stung by the power of death. Another line of this hymn asks, &#8220;Where thy victory, O grave?&#8221; Many Christians cannot sing this with any sense of reality. The last lines of this hymn say that now we soar where Christ has led, following our exalted Head, and that like Him we rise, &#8220;free from all the earthly ties.&#8221; However, in our experience are we rising and soaring? Are we truly free from all the earthly ties? Not many of us can answer these questions in a positive way.<p>Although this is a good hymn on certain objective aspects of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, it does not express what the Gospel of John reveals to us regarding the resurrection of Christ. In John&#8217;s Gospel the resurrection is divine and mysterious, for it is related to Christ&#8217;s multiplication and glorification. According to this book, we have become the many brothers of the resurrected Christ. This means that we are His multiplication, His glorification, in resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S SECRET ASCENSION TO THE FATHER</h2><p>Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection, Christ went secretly to the Father. This was a secret ascension. In verse 17 the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had &#8220;not yet ascended to the Father.&#8221; This secret ascension to the Father was the ultimate fulfillment of the going predicted in 16:5-7, and it took place forty days before His public ascension in the sight of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11). After ascending to satisfy the Father, He returned to the disciples (John 20:19). As the firstfruit of the harvest in typology was first brought to God, so the freshness of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was first for the Father&#8217;s enjoyment.<p>The Old Testament type of which we are speaking is found in Leviticus 23:10-11: &#8220;Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.&#8221; Furthermore, concerning the firstfruits Exodus 23:19 says this: &#8220;The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God.&#8221; The firstfruits were not to be enjoyed by the people; rather, they were to be offered to God for His enjoyment.<p>According to Leviticus 23:11, the day the firstfruit was offered to God was one day after the Sabbath, that is, on the first day of the week. From the day the firstfruit was offered, the people were to count seven weeks (Lev. 23:15-16). The feast of Pentecost would then be held on the fiftieth day. The time from John 20 to the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 was exactly fifty days. After the Lord was resurrected, He manifested Himself to His disciples over a period of forty days. At the expiration of those days, He publicly ascended to the heavens; that is, He ascended openly in the sight of His disciples. Following His public ascension, the disciples prayed for ten days, and then the day of Pentecost came.<p>The Lord&#8217;s secret ascension is inserted into John&#8217;s account of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. We need to be impressed with the fact that in John&#8217;s record there is such an insertion. Immediately after the Lord was resurrected, He was ready to go to the Father. However, He was held back for a little while by the love of Mary the Magdalene. Because Mary was there seeking Him, He did not go immediately. Instead, He remained for a time to take care of this sister, who was weeping because she could not find Him. After speaking with her, He ascended to the Father.<p>It was a good thing that the Lord was held back. It is due to this delay that we have the revelation recorded in verse 17. If Mary had not been present, the Lord would not have had anyone to whom to speak these words: &#8220;I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&#8221; What a great revelation this is! If we did not have this word, how would we know that on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection we became His brothers? We should be thankful to Mary that her love held the Lord back at least for a few minutes in order to reveal such a mystery. This word is part of the record that indicates Christ&#8217;s secret ascension to present the firstfruit of resurrection to the Father for His enjoyment.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE DISCIPLE&#8217;S GATHERING ON THE DAY OF THE LORD&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>Verse 19 indicates that on the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the Lord&#8217;s disciples were gathered together. This gathering of the disciples on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection signifies the Lord&#8217;s brothers meeting as His church. This means that the first church meeting took place in the evening of the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. When the disciples came together, they did not have the intention to meet as the church. They came together because of fear of the Jews. Then much to their surprise, &#8220;Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.&#8221; By His appearing the Lord changed their gathering into a meeting of the church.<p>When some hear that the first church meeting took place in John 20:19, they may protest and say that this chapter does not indicate a church meeting. Regarding this, we need to consider Hebrews 2:11b and 12: &#8220;He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&#8221; This indicates that after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, He came to the disciples to declare the Father&#8217;s name concerning them as the church. If this did not take place in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, when did it happen? In John 20 we have a record that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples and met with them. These disciples, who had become His brothers, had now become the church. Therefore, in verse 19 we have the first church meeting.<p>The disciples came together out of fear. We may say that at first the center of their gathering was this fear. But the center was changed to the resurrected Christ. When fear was the center of their gathering, they did not have any peace or joy. But when the Lord appeared in their midst, He said to them, &#8220;Peace be to you.&#8221; That was a timely word. On the one hand, the disciples were comforted; on the other hand, they were shocked by the Lord&#8217;s sudden appearance. The doors were shut where they were meeting. How, then, had the Lord come into the room? He came with a resurrected body into the room with the doors shut. Verse 20 says, &#8220;Having said this, He showed them both His hands and His side.&#8221; In this way, He was indicating to them that He was Jesus their Lord. &#8220;The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.&#8221;<p>According to verse 21, &#8220;Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent me, I also send you.&#8221; The Father sent the Son by being one with the Son and by coming with the Son. The Son sends His disciples in the same way the Father sent Him. This means that as the Father sent Him by being one with Him and coming with Him, so the Lord would send the disciples by being one with them and by going with them. He would be within the disciples as the Father is in the Son.<p>In order to send the disciples in this way, &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 22). The Holy Spirit is nothing less than the resurrected Lord Jesus Himself, because this Spirit is His breath. The Greek word for Spirit in this verse is pneuma, a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind. Therefore, this verse can rightly be translated, &#8220;Receive the holy breath.&#8221; On the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath.<p>The Christ who breathed Himself into the disciples is the life-giving Spirit. Some theologians use the term &#8220;the pneumatic Christ&#8221; to refer to the Christ who is the Spirit, the breath. In resurrection, Christ Himself is breath. Where was the Lord after He breathed Himself into His disciples? The answer is that He was now dwelling in them. Therefore, when He sent them, He could go with them by being in them. The principle is the same with us today. When we are sent by Him, He goes with us because He is in us.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S SENDING</h2><p>The last sign in this chapter is that of the Lord&#8217;s sending of His disciples (v. 21). As we have already indicated, this signifies that His commission to the disciples is like the Father&#8217;s commission to Him. If we consider this matter carefully, we shall realize that it is a great thing. God came to man in the way of being in His Son. Therefore, when the Son came, God the Father came in the Son and with the Son. Now, through death and resurrection, the Son has been multiplied. The Son sends the disciples as the Father sent Him-by being in them to be one with them. Hence, the disciples are one with the Son and also one with the Father.<p>Do you know what the church is? The church is the sent ones meeting with the Son and the Father. Whenever we meet, we have the Son and the Father within us. Wherever we go, the Son and the Father go with us. If we see this, we shall have assurance and confidence, and this assurance and confidence will become our power and authority.<p>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and we are the multiplication of the Son. This is what it means to be a Christian, one who believes in Christ. Christians are actually the multiplication of the embodiment of God. This sounds like a heavenly language. Whenever we come together in the church meetings, we need to have the realization that we, the believers, are the multiplication of the embodiment of God. Such a realization will surely change our church life and cause our spirits to soar.<p>We have seen that the first seventeen chapters of the Gospel of John present God living as a man among men. Chapters eighteen and nineteen present life passing through the process of death. Now in chapters twenty and twenty-one we see resurrection. This resurrection is the Spirit, the pneuma. Therefore, in chapters one through seventeen, we have God; in chapters eighteen and nineteen, we have life; and in chapters twenty and twenty-one, we have the Spirit in resurrection. This means that in the Gospel of John we have God, life, and the Spirit. Chapters one through seventeen show us God living among men; chapters eighteen and nineteen, life passing through death; and chapters twenty and twenty-one, the Spirit, the pneuma, moving in resurrection.<p>The moving of the Spirit in resurrection has not ceased; rather, it continues today. Concerning this, there is no end to the Gospel of John. This Gospel does not give us a record of the Lord&#8217;s public ascension, as we have in Mark and Luke. According to the Gospel of John, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath and now dwells in them. Therefore, this breath, this pneuma, is still moving in resurrection.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that God lived among men, that life passed through death, and that now the Spirit is moving in resurrection. Do you know where we are today? We are in resurrection enjoying this pneuma as the multiplication of the embodiment of God, and this multiplication is the Lord&#8217;s glorification. Praise the Lord for the marvelous revelation in chapter twenty of John!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:1-23</h1><p>Many years ago I wondered why chapter twenty-one was included at the end of the Gospel of John. I thought that this chapter was too simple to be the last chapter in a book that covers profound, divine, and mysterious things. But eventually I came to understand that without such a chapter, we would not know how to experience in a practical way the divine and mysterious things revealed in this book.<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we have the eternal Word, which was with God and was even God Himself. This eternal Word became flesh and lived on earth to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose. Eventually, He went to the cross and died there to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption. He took away the sin of the world, He judged the world, He cast out Satan, the ruler of the world, He dealt with our serpentine nature, and He released the divine life from within Him. All this was accomplished as a result of the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion. In resurrection the Lord brought us into the divine life. Therefore, through His resurrection we were regenerated. According to chapter twenty, in resurrection the Lord came back in the form of the Spirit. Hence, He became the pneumatic Christ, and as this pneumatic Christ He breathed Himself into His disciples. This is the wonderful revelation of the Gospel of John.<p>I would ask you to consider the last two verses of chapter twenty: &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name&#8221; (vv. 30-31). It seems that these verses are the conclusion of this Gospel. Many readers of the Gospel of John may have the feeling that they have come to the conclusion of this book when they have completed chapter twenty. However, if we consider this matter more carefully, we shall realize that there is the need of a concluding chapter.<h2 class=head1>THREE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS</h2><p>We have seen that in chapters one through twenty we have a revelation of the eternal Word becoming flesh to accomplish everything related to God&#8217;s purpose. After dying an all-inclusive death, this One became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and as the Spirit He breathed Himself into His disciples. Although this is marvelous, up to this point nothing has been said concerning our practical living on earth. How are we to live? How should we earn a living? Peter may have taken the lead to ask, &#8220;Lord Jesus, it is wonderful that You are now the life-giving Spirit, and that You have been breathed into us, but, Lord, how can we make a living here on earth?&#8221;<p>A second question we may have after reading chapter twenty concerns the carrying out of God&#8217;s purpose. To be sure, God&#8217;s purpose has not been fully carried out in chapter twenty. Actually, the breathing of the Lord into His disciples was the beginning for them to carry out God&#8217;s purpose. This is indicated by the fact that before He breathed on them and told them to receive the Holy Spirit, He said to them, &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, I also send you&#8221; (v. 21). This word indicates the Lord&#8217;s commission, for His sending was His commission. But how in a practical way should the disciples carry out the Lord&#8217;s sending? What should they do to fulfill His commission?<p>Another question concerns the disciples&#8217; future. How should they follow Him in the future? They had followed the Lord for three and a half years. But after the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, they could no longer follow Him in that way. The Lord&#8217;s resurrection was a new beginning with respect to their following Him. How, then, should the disciples follow Him after His resurrection?<p>We have asked three questions: the first, concerning the practical living of the disciples; the second, concerning the way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s commission; and the third, concerning the way to follow the Lord after His resurrection. If we did not have chapter twenty-one, we would find it difficult to answer these three practical questions.<p>John 20:20 says, &#8220;The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.&#8221; In the church meetings sometimes we are like the disciples in that we also are happy and joyful in the Lord. However, after the meeting we may have certain questions. We may wonder how to make a living in this world. Perhaps we will say to ourselves, &#8220;In the meeting we received a commission from the Lord. But what should we do to carry out this commission? We were deeply touched by Him in the meeting, and we even received the holy breath through the Lord&#8217;s breathing upon us. But how should we follow Him now? What will be our future as followers of Christ?&#8221; As we shall see, the answer to these questions is found in chapter twenty-one. For this reason, John 21 is an intimate chapter, and we appreciate it very much.<h2 class=head1>AN AGGREGATE SIGN</h2><p>In this series of messages we have been considering the signs in all the chapters in the Gospel of John. Now we need to see that everything in chapter twenty-one is a sign. I cannot say how many signs there are in this chapter. Instead, I would prefer to say that this chapter is an aggregate of signs, that here we have a concluding sign that involves a number of things.<h2 class=head1>SOME ASPECTS OF THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>Omniscient</h2><p>Before we begin to consider the aspects of the aggregate sign in chapter twenty-one, I would like to point out a few matters concerning the pneumatic Christ as revealed in this chapter. According to the record of John 21, there is no doubt that the pneumatic Christ is omniscient. He knows everything. What is written in this chapter definitely indicates that the Lord knows everything.<h2 class=head2>Omnipresent</h2><p>The pneumatic Christ is also omnipresent. He is everywhere. There is no way that we can get away from Him. For example, when the disciples went fishing, He was standing on the shore watching. This indicates that He is omnipresent.<h2 class=head2>Omnipotent</h2><p>Furthermore, the pneumatic Christ is omnipotent. As the omnipotent One, He is altogether powerful and capable of controlling the environment. I believe that in this chapter the Lord controlled the fish and caused them to stay away from Peter and those with him in the boat. Peter and the sons of Zebedee (John and James) were professional fishermen, the sea of Tiberias was large and full of fish, and the night was the right time for fishing. Nevertheless, through the entire night they caught nothing. It must have been that the Lord commanded all the fishes to stay away from their net. The omnipotent Lord Jesus controlled every fish.<p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread.&#8221; Here we again see the Lord&#8217;s omnipotence: He provided fish and bread for the disciples. We also see His care for them in the details of life.<p>How marvelous the Lord is! He is complete, perfect, merciful, and kind. As the omniscient One, He even predicted that Peter would be martyred and that John would outlive him. This chapter, therefore, is rich in what it signifies concerning the all-inclusive pneumatic Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SITUATION OF THE DISCIPLES</h2><p>In this chapter we see not only the all-inclusive and all-capable Christ; we also see the situation of the disciples. In chapter twenty they received two great blessings on two successive Lord&#8217;s Days. No doubt, what the disciples experienced was marvelous. However, 21:3 says, &#8220;Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We are coming with you.&#8221; To be sure, the Lord Jesus did not send Peter fishing. Peter decided on his own to go fishing.<p>The account in chapter twenty-one of Peter&#8217;s experience in fishing reminds us of what is recorded in chapter five of the Gospel of Luke. This chapter tells us that Peter was called by the Lord through a miracle related to fishing. The Lord said to Simon, &#8220;Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught&#8221; (Luke 5:4). Simon answered Him, saying, &#8220;Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net&#8221; (v. 5). The result was that they caught &#8220;a great multitude of fishes&#8221; (v. 6). After this incident the Lord said to Simon, &#8220;Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men&#8221; (v. 10). Through the miracle in Luke 5, Peter was called by the Lord.<p>I doubt that during the years he followed the Lord Jesus Peter went fishing on his own initiative at all. Except for Matthew 17:27, can you find any hint in the Gospels that Peter went fishing between the time he was called and the incident recorded in John 21? But now we see that even after two meetings with the resurrected Christ, meetings in which the disciples received great blessing, Peter decided to go fishing again. Peter probably felt that he had nothing to do. He may have said to himself, &#8220;Where is the Lord? I followed Him for more than three years. I did see Him after His resurrection, and He came back to meet with us twice. Those were wonderful meetings we had with Him. But where is He now? And what should I do about the practical problem of finding something to eat? I can&#8217;t endure having nothing to do day after day, and we hardly have anything to eat. We must do something. Since I cannot bear the situation any longer, I&#8217;m going fishing.&#8221;<p>For Peter to go fishing meant that he was going back to his old profession. Peter may have felt that the Lord had left them and that they had nothing to do, nothing to live on, and nowhere to go. Hence, he went back to his old way of life, to his old occupation. We know from 21:2 that six others of the Lord&#8217;s disciples went with him.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S TRAINING OF HIS DISCIPLES</h2><h2 class=head2>To Experience His Invisible Presence</h2><p>The disciples did not realize that the Lord Jesus had not left them. From the time that He breathed Himself into them, He remained in them. There is no record in chapter twenty of the Lord&#8217;s leaving the disciples. Because the Lord was in the disciples, when they went fishing, He went with them. Concerning this, it is significant that 21:1 tells us, &#8220;Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias.&#8221; Notice that this verse does not say that the Lord Jesus came to them. It says that He manifested Himself to them.<p>The disciples spent the whole night fishing. Possibly they began in the evening. The Lord did not appear to them until morning. It seems that He was silent and hid Himself as they spent the entire night trying to catch fish.<p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;Now as the morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore.&#8221; The Lord manifested Himself to them again. We should not think, however, that the Lord was away from them during the night. No, He went fishing with them. Actually, they brought the Lord to the sea of Tiberias, for He was in them. Although the Lord dwelt in them and went with them wherever they went, they did not realize this. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s main purpose in this chapter was to train His disciples to realize His invisible presence.<p>The disciples had enjoyed the Lord&#8217;s visible presence for three and a half years and were accustomed to it. Then suddenly the Lord changed His way of being with them. Now He was the pneumatic Christ. When the Lord was in the flesh, He was visibly present with the disciples. Then in resurrection He became the invisible pneuma. This pneuma is real, but it is not visible to human eyes. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to train the disciples to experience and enjoy His invisible presence. He did not want them to think that He had left them. He wanted them to realize that He would always be with them. This was the reason the Lord took forty days, from the day of resurrection until the day of His ascension, to train the disciples to realize His invisible presence. In the Bible the number forty signifies a period of testing or training. During this period of forty days the Lord trained His disciples to appreciate His invisible presence. Actually, the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence is more precious and prevailing than His visible presence. This is the basic lesson the Lord was teaching the disciples in John 21.<h2 class=head2>To Trust in Him for Their Living</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus manifested Himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, His word exposed the reason they went fishing: &#8220;Little children, do you have any fish to eat? They answered Him, No&#8221; (v. 5). Here we see that the disciples went fishing because they had nothing to eat. They came to the sea of Tiberias expecting to catch fish. But they labored the whole night and caught nothing.<p>The Lord said to them, &#8220;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were not able to haul it in, because of the abundance of fishes.&#8221; Here we see that the Lord was training His disciples to trust in Him for their living. The Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to go fishing in order to have something to eat. I will feed you. Simply stay with Me, and I will take care of your living.&#8221;<p>Some of the saints may say, &#8220;Brother Lee, we agree with you concerning what you minister about spiritual things. But when you tell us that the Lord Jesus will feed us, that He will take care of the practical matters of our daily living, we need to consider further. I&#8217;m not sure that the Lord Jesus will really feed me. Maybe I should go back to my old profession.&#8221; Regarding this, I do not care to argue with anyone. I would simply point out that according to history the Lord always feeds His people. Yes, you need to work at a job. That is your duty, your responsibility. But you need to realize that the environment is not under your control. Rather, the environment is in the Lord&#8217;s hands and under His control.<p>In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training Peter and other disciples to trust in Him for their living. I doubt that Peter prayed to the Lord concerning their living after those two meetings with the resurrected Christ on two successive Lord&#8217;s Days. The disciples did not have the proper spiritual realization, the right spiritual habit. They did not practice living in a spiritual way. There is nothing to indicate that Peter prayed to the Lord when he was in need of food. Instead of praying, Peter said, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221; This utterance indicates Peter&#8217;s disappointment with his situation. Because he could no longer tolerate not knowing what to do, he decided to go fishing.<p>In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training the disciples by keeping all the fish away from them. Here the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;Do you think that you are able to catch fish? I am the One who created the fish. If I had not created these fish, how could you get any? I am still the Creator, and the entire universe is under My hand. If you don&#8217;t go My way and carry out My commission to be sent out, you will not be able to catch anything. All I have to do is say the word, and the fish will stay away from you. I want you to know that I am here. Listen to Me, and don&#8217;t go fishing by yourselves. When I say go fishing, then you should go fishing. When I say let down the net, you should let the net down. Don&#8217;t do anything by yourselves.&#8221; According to verse 6, the Lord told the disciples to cast the net on the right side of the boat. When they did this, they caught an abundance of fishes.<p>When the disciples got onto the land with the fishes, they saw a fire of coals with fish lying on it and bread (v. 9). According to the Lord&#8217;s word, they had caught an abundance of fishes. But then they learned that the Lord had already prepared fish and bread for them. By this the Lord trained them to realize that He is able to provide fish for them. Though they caught many fish according to the Lord&#8217;s word, the Lord did not use these fish to feed them. No doubt, this was a real lesson to Peter.<p>There is no indication that the disciples asked the Lord Jesus how He obtained the fish and the bread. I certainly do not know where these fish came from. Here the fish and the bread signify the riches of the Lord&#8217;s supply. The Lord provided the disciples with the riches of the sea and of the land.<h2 class=head1>RESTORED BY THE LORD</h2><p>The disciples, especially Peter, learned a great deal from the Lord in John 21. There is no further record to indicate that Peter was ever again troubled concerning the matter of having food to eat. Furthermore, there is no hint that Peter went fishing again. Instead of remaining in Galilee, he went to Jerusalem according to the Lord&#8217;s word, a place that was not safe for the followers of the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, he and the others had the boldness to remain in Jerusalem for ten days praying. We do not know how they obtained the necessary supply of food. But it is clear from Acts 1 that Peter was not concerned about this. On the contrary, Peter was taking care of the Lord&#8217;s commission. For example, he spoke of the need of a replacement for Judas (Acts 1:15-22). But he had learned the lesson not to say, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221; In this matter, he was trained by the Lord. By this we see that chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John is very practical.<p>I can testify from my experience with the Lord that He is able to provide for our needs. On the day I was saved, I was walking home, and I stopped and said, &#8220;Lord, I am willing to give up the whole world. I simply want to take my Bible and go throughout the villages preaching Christ. I don&#8217;t care what I eat, and I am willing to suffer poverty. I only care to preach Christ.&#8221; That was my only intention, and I made that decision before the Lord in 1925. Some years later the Lord raised up a church in my home town. As the number increased and the need became greater, the Lord burdened me to give up my job and to serve Him full time. He reminded me of what I had said to Him that day on the street. Then He told me that it was time for me to leave my job and serve Him by taking care of the church. I knew that He did not want me to serve as a hired one, but He wanted me to serve Him by faith. After more than fifty years of experience, I can testify that the Lord is faithful.<p>On the one hand, Peter was trained by the Lord in John 21 in a strict, thorough way. On the other hand, the Lord used the situation in His wisdom to restore Peter. It was by a miracle related to fishing that the Lord had called Peter three and a half years earlier. Then after Peter&#8217;s backsliding from the Lord&#8217;s calling to his old profession, the Lord manifested Himself again to restore Peter through another miracle related to fishing. I believe that the Lord used this as a sign purposely to remind Peter of how He had called him three and a half years before. Therefore, in this aspect of the aggregate sign in chapter twenty-one we see that Peter was not only trained but also restored.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg> THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:1-25</h1><p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that all of John 21 is a sign, an aggregate sign. Everything recorded in this chapter is a part of this aggregate sign. In this message we shall go on to consider more aspects of the sign in John 21.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRE</h2><p>John 21:9 says, &#8220;When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread.&#8221; In the foregoing message we pointed out that this verse indicates the Lord&#8217;s ability to provide food for His disciples. Now we want to pay attention to the significance of the fire.<p>This fire must have been a reminder to Peter of the fire by which he was warming himself on the night he denied the Lord Jesus. Mark 14:54 says that Peter &#8220;was sitting with the deputies and warming himself in the light of the fire.&#8221; Here in chapter twenty-one the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, &#8220;The night I was betrayed and arrested, you were warming yourself by a fire when you denied Me. Now I have made a fire here in order to prepare food for you.&#8221; Do you not think that this fire served as a reminder to Peter of that other fire?<p>First, in John 21 Peter experienced the miracle concerning the abundance of fishes, and then he saw the fire. The miracle reminded Peter of the Lord&#8217;s calling of him three and a half years before, and the fire reminded him of his denying the Lord some days before. We should not think that the miracle of the fishes and the fire have no purpose. I believe that the Lord performed a miracle for the purpose of reminding Peter of His calling of him and also made a fire for the purpose of reminding Peter of his denying of Him.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S QUESTIONING OF PETER</h2><p>When Peter denied the Lord Jesus, he denied Him three times. Now in John 21 the Lord asked Peter three times, &#8220;Do you love Me?&#8221; (vv. 15-17). Verse 15 says, &#8220;Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&#8221; On the night Peter denied the Lord, he said to Him, &#8220;Even if all shall be stumbled, yet I will not!&#8221; (Mark 14:29). Here in John 21 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, &#8220;Do you love Me more than the other disciples do? You should remember your word spoken on the night I was betrayed. You told Me that even if all the others would fall away, you would not be stumbled. Eventually, Peter, you were the one who denied Me. Now I ask you this question: Do you love Me more than all these?&#8221; To be sure, this question was a reminder of what Peter had done on the night he denied the Lord Jesus.<p>In 21:15-17 two different Greek words are used for love: agapao and phileo. Agapao denotes a love which is higher and nobler than phileo. In verse 15, agapao is used in the Lord&#8217;s question, and phileo is used in Peter&#8217;s answer. This indicates that Peter did not dare to say that he loved the Lord Jesus with a higher, nobler love. In verse 16 agapao is again used in the Lord&#8217;s question, and phileo is used in Peter&#8217;s reply. Then in verse 17 phileo is used both for the question asked by the Lord Jesus and the answer given by Peter. This verse says, &#8220;He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.&#8221; Here Peter seems to be saying, &#8220;Lord, when I boasted that I would not be stumbled because of You, I was full of self-confidence. You told me that I would deny You three times, and this happened, just as You said it would. Lord, You know everything. You know that I love You.&#8221;<p>I do not believe that Peter was at peace when the Lord was questioning him. He was very troubled by the Lord&#8217;s questions, and he may have felt like covering his face. Instead of giving Peter a long message, the Lord set up a fire as a reminder to him. Then He fed him and questioned him concerning his love for Him.<p>Even though the Lord did not question Peter until the disciples had eaten breakfast, I find it hard to believe that Peter enjoyed that breakfast very much. As he was eating, the fire must have reminded him of that other fire. Immediately after breakfast, the Lord began to question Peter. The Lord&#8217;s third question bothered him very much. In his answer Peter seemed to be saying, &#8220;Lord, You don&#8217;t need me to tell You whether or not I love You. Even if I say that I love You, I am not able in myself to fulfill my word. But whatever You say, Lord, will be fulfilled.&#8221; Here also Peter was being trained by the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head1>SHEPHERDING THE LORD&#8217;S FLOCK</h2><p>In verse 15 the Lord said to Peter, &#8220;Feed My lambs&#8221;; in verse 16, &#8220;Shepherd My sheep&#8221;; and in verse 17, &#8220;Feed My sheep.&#8221; Here the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;Peter, since you love Me, you should feed My sheep. You don&#8217;t need to go fishing any more. Instead, take care of My sheep; shepherd My flock. Instead of taking care of your own eating, you need to feed My flock. You should not only feed the sheep-you should also shepherd them.&#8221;<p>Shepherding includes feeding, but feeding does not comprise shepherding. Feeding is a matter of providing food to the hungry ones. A shepherd, of course, will feed the flock. Psalm 23 has the thought of feeding. According to this Psalm, the Lord as our Shepherd causes us to lie down in the tender grass, and He leads us beside the waters of quietness. He even prepares a feast for us in the presence of the enemy. This points to the shepherd&#8217;s feeding of the flock. The main thing the shepherd does is to take care of the feeding of the sheep. However, shepherding includes more than feeding. When a wolf comes, the sheep need to be protected. Therefore, in Psalm 23 the Shepherd has the rod and the staff to use in protecting the flock from anything that would cause harm.<p>In John 21 the Lord first tells Peter to feed His lambs; then He charges him to shepherd His sheep. In these verses the words &#8220;lambs&#8221; and &#8220;sheep&#8221; refer to the flock, which is a collective noun denoting the church. Shepherding is for the flock (10:14-16), which is the church (Acts 20:28).<p>Later, in his first Epistle Peter charges the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-4). According to 1 Peter 2, we need to long for the milk of the word so that we may grow. This is a matter of feeding. Growth is for the building of the spiritual house, the church. As we have seen, the church is God&#8217;s flock. In his first Epistle Peter regards the Lord as the chief Shepherd and all the elders, including himself, as shepherds caring for God&#8217;s flock. This indicates that the matters concerning which the Lord trained Peter in John 21 were deeply impressed upon him. Peter certainly received the Lord&#8217;s training.<h2 class=head1>FURTHER TRAINING</h2><p>In John 21 the Lord Jesus went on to give Peter further training, training concerning his death to glorify God (vv. 18-22). In verse 18 the Lord said to Peter, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.&#8221;<p>Here the Lord was telling Peter, &#8220;Peter, when you were young, you went wherever you wanted. If you wanted to go fishing, you went fishing. But for the sake of My commission to take care of My flock, the day will come when another will gird you and carry you where you do not want to go. You will be arrested as I was arrested, and you will be put on a cross even as I was put on a cross.&#8221; The Lord said these words to signify &#8220;by what kind of death he would glorify God&#8221; (v. 19). After the Lord had spoken these words to Peter, He said to him, &#8220;Follow Me!&#8221;<p>Peter, when he heard that he would be martyred to glorify God, wanted to know what would happen to another disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. &#8220;Peter therefore seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man?&#8221; In this matter, we are the same as Peter. If we were called by the Lord to be martyrs, we would want to know about the destiny of other brothers in the Lord. The Lord answered Peter in a wonderful way: &#8220;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!&#8221; (v. 22).<p>Apparently what is described in 21:18-22 is simple and easy to understand. Actually, what is recorded here is deep, for it is part of the aggregate sign in this chapter. In these verses we have two matters: martyrdom and living until the Lord&#8217;s coming. Many of the Lord&#8217;s followers will die, but some will live until His coming. If we die, we should die in such a way as to glorify God. If we live, we should live in such a way that we shall give a good account to the Lord at His coming. This is the real sense of the Lord&#8217;s word here. Those who die should die for the glorification of God, and those who live until the Lord&#8217;s coming need to prepare themselves to give a good account to Him at His coming back.<p>If we put together all the matters covered in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John, we shall see that this chapter is all-inclusive. It answers the questions we may have about our living, about the way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s commission, and about our future as followers of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>A BROAD SPAN</h2><p>The span of the things covered in the last two chapters of the Gospel of John is very broad. It begins with the discovery of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection and ends with His coming back. Between these two events are all the things related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection concerning the brothers and the Father by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence; being breathed on by the Lord with the Holy Spirit and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord with the natural strength dealt with; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; and practicing the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence, in which some follow Him even to death to glorify God, not by self-will, but according to His leading, and some live until He comes back.<p>At the beginning of chapter twenty the Lord&#8217;s resurrection is discovered. At the end of chapter twenty-one there is a definite reference to the Lord&#8217;s coming back. Between these two events, the Lord&#8217;s resurrection and His coming, we have various matters related to the Christian life during the church age. First, as exemplified by Mary the Magdalene, we have the matter of seeking the Lord with love for Him. Mary certainly was one who loved the Lord and sought Him. Because she sought Him in love, Mary saw the Lord in His resurrection and received the revelation concerning the issue of His resurrection regarding His brothers and our Father. What a great revelation this is!<p>We all need to see the revelation concerning the issue of Christ&#8217;s resurrection-the producing of His many brothers. Because of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, God is our Father, and we have been begotten, regenerated, by Him to be His many sons. We need to receive this revelation through experiencing Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>Furthermore, we need to meet with the brothers in the church to enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence and then be breathed on by the Lord to receive the Holy Spirit. This enjoyment of the Lord&#8217;s presence and this receiving of the Holy Spirit take place in the church meetings.<p>We also need to be sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him. As those sent out by the Lord, we must learn to live by faith in Him. We need to trust in Him for all the needs of our daily living.<p>Moreover, we should love the Lord, but we should not love Him with our natural strength. We should be those who have had the natural strength dealt with. No longer should we be like Peter before he denied the Lord. As we have seen, in chapter twenty-one Peter was reminded not to love the Lord Jesus with his natural strength. After reminding Peter of this, the Lord charged him to shepherd the flock for the building up of the church. We also should carry out the shepherding of the sheep.<p>Finally, we need to practice the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence either until we die to glorify God or until He comes back. We need to consider all these matters and then apply them to ourselves in our Christian experience.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:1-25</h1><p>This is the concluding message in the series of messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John. In these messages we have considered the signs in the twenty-one chapters of this Gospel. In the two foregoing messages on chapter twenty-one, we pointed out that this chapter is actually an aggregate sign, for everything in it is part of a composite sign.<p>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord reminded Peter of his calling and Peter&#8217;s denial and then restored him and charged him to feed His sheep. We have also seen that according to the Lord&#8217;s word in 21:18-22, some believers will die to glorify God, and others will live until His coming. Furthermore, we pointed out that chapters twenty and twenty-one cover a broad span, a span that begins with the discovery of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection and ends with His coming back. Between these two events are all the matters related to the Christian life. In this concluding message let us consider some other important matters revealed in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE PRESENCE</h2><p>If we study this chapter carefully, we shall see an apparent contradiction in the Lord&#8217;s words recorded here. On the one hand, the Lord said to Peter, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (vv. 19, 22). On the other hand, the Lord referred to His coming back (vv. 22-23). If I had been Peter, I might have said to the Lord, &#8220;Lord Jesus, why do You talk about Your coming? Does this mean that You intend to leave us?&#8221;<p>Let us suppose that Peter asked such a question and that the Lord Jesus gave the following answer: &#8220;Yes, I shall leave you for hundreds of years. Then after those centuries have passed, I shall come back.&#8221; If the Lord had given such an answer and if I had been Peter, I would have said, &#8220;Lord, if You will be absent from us, why do You ask me to follow You? How can I follow You if You leave us?&#8221;<p>Apparently the Lord&#8217;s words concerning following Him and concerning His coming are contradictory. In order for us to follow the Lord, it is necessary that He be present with us. But in order for Him to come back, it is necessary that He go away from us. How can we reconcile these things?<p>The Lord was present with the disciples. How, then, could He say, &#8220;Until I come&#8221;? Since He was present with them, He did not need to come. If the Lord meant that He would leave the disciples and later come back to them, how could He say, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221;? How could the disciples follow Him if He was not present with them? The answer to all these questions is the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence. According to His visible presence, He would leave and come back later. But according to His invisible presence, He would be with them all the time. On the one hand, He would be with them; on the other hand, He would be away from them. Therefore, they could both follow Him and wait for His coming back.<p>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus remained with the disciples for forty days (Acts 1:3-4) in order to train them to realize, practice, and live by His invisible presence. In verse 23 the Lord indicates that some of His believers will follow Him to death for the glory of God and that some will live until He comes.<p>According to the Lord&#8217;s visible presence, He is away from us. At the time of His coming back, the Lord&#8217;s visible presence will be recovered. In the meantime, according to His invisible presence He is with us. Because the Lord was in Peter, Peter could follow Him. This means that he could follow the Lord as the One who dwelt in him.<h2 class=head1>THE INWARD AND OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>With the truths in the Bible there are two aspects: an outward, visible aspect and an inward, invisible aspect. We have been opposed by those who hold only the outward aspect, the outward view, because we have both the outward and inward aspects. The outward aspect or view of the truth is mainly a matter of doctrine, but the inward aspect is for experience. If we have only the outward aspect of a particular truth, we shall not have any experience of that truth. In particular, if we hold only to the Lord&#8217;s visible presence, how shall we be able to experience Him? Physically, He is in the third heaven, and we could not experience Him if that were His only aspect.<p>The majority of today&#8217;s Christians have an objective religion of objective doctrine. They have little subjective experience of the indwelling Christ. For this reason, we in the Lord&#8217;s recovery have been emphasizing the inward aspect of the biblical truths. I can testify that I care very much for the inward aspect, the inward view, of the truth.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING THE LORD IN HIS INVISIBLE PRESENCE</h2><p>Which aspect of the Lord&#8217;s presence do you treasure more, the aspect of His visible presence or the aspect of His invisible presence? If we answered this question frankly, most of us would have to admit that we treasure His visible presence more than His invisible presence. Because this is our situation, if the Lord were suddenly to appear in His visible presence, most of the saints would be frightened rather than excited. The reason for this reaction would be that they have not had sufficient experience of the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence. If we experience the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence adequately, then we shall be excited when we are brought into His visible presence. The experience of the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence is a preparation for us to meet Him in His visible presence, which will then become a genuine and practical enjoyment to us.<p>Too few of today&#8217;s Christians pay adequate attention to the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence. Because this is the situation, we are burdened concerning this matter.<p>Because the Gospel of John emphasizes the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence, in this Gospel there is no record of the Lord&#8217;s public ascension. What is emphasized in the Gospel of John concerning Christ after His resurrection is His invisible presence.<p>After His resurrection He became the pneumatic Christ. Hence, He is no longer the Christ in the flesh. When He was on earth, He was given a wonderful name-Emmanuel. But today He is not Emmanuel in a physical way; instead, He is the indwelling Spirit. Do you prefer the Lord as Emmanuel, as the One with you outwardly, or as the life-giving Spirit, the One dwelling within you? We all need to treasure the indwelling Spirit. The wonderful indwelling Spirit is actually the Lord Himself in His invisible presence.<p>By the Lord&#8217;s mercy I can testify that day by day I enjoy the Lord in His invisible presence. Even though I may sometimes be weak, I still treasure His invisible presence. Of course, I am waiting to meet the Lord in His visible presence. But while I am waiting to meet Him in this way, I need more experience and enjoyment of His invisible presence.<h2 class=head1>TWO ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We have seen that with the Lord&#8217;s presence there are two aspects, the visible presence and the invisible presence. The Gospel of John also reveals two aspects of the Spirit. John 14:16-17a says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality.&#8221; According to these verses, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would give us another Comforter, and this other Comforter is the Spirit of reality.<p>According to this chapter, the Spirit, being another Comforter, would seem to be another person, because a comforter is a person. The Lord Jesus was the first Comforter. Because He as the first Comforter is a person, then the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, should also be a person. Therefore, in John 14 we have two Comforters, the Lord and the Spirit of reality, and it seems that these two Comforters are two persons.<p>The other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, is the Spirit spoken of in 7:39. The Lord&#8217;s promise concerning the giving of another Comforter was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection, when the Spirit was breathed into the disciples as the holy breath. According to 20:22, the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here the Spirit is presented not as a person, another Comforter, but as the breath of Christ. Therefore, in chapters fourteen and twenty we have two aspects of the Spirit: the Spirit as another Comforter and the Spirit as the breath of Christ. How can a person&#8217;s breath be regarded as another person? This is impossible. Hence, whereas the Spirit as another Comforter is a person, the Spirit as the breath of Christ is not a person separate from Christ.<p>Actually, these two aspects of the Spirit denote an outward and inward aspect of the truth concerning the Spirit. The Spirit as another Comforter is the outward aspect, and the Spirit as Christ&#8217;s breath is the inward aspect.<p>Mindful of these two aspects, let us consider once again the scene in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John. We have seen that, according to chapter fourteen, Christ is the first Comforter and the Spirit is another Comforter. But according to chapter twenty, this second Comforter is actually the breath of the first Comforter. Verse 22 says that the Lord breathed into His disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit. He did not breathe on them and say, &#8220;Receive another Comforter.&#8221; Here the breath is not called another Comforter; rather, the Lord&#8217;s breath is called the Holy Spirit. Hence, in John 20 the Holy Spirit is the breath of Christ. Since a person&#8217;s breath is not another person, how, then, can the Holy Spirit, as the breath of Christ, be another person, a person different from Christ? This kind of question poses a problem to traditional theology.<p>Some who read this word concerning the Spirit as another Comforter and the Spirit as Christ&#8217;s breath may ask, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe that Christ and the Spirit are distinct? Don&#8217;t you believe that Christ and the Spirit are two?&#8221; Yes, I believe that, as viewed from one aspect, the outward, objective aspect, Christ and the Spirit are two. However, as viewed from another aspect, the inward, subjective aspect, the Spirit, the second Comforter, is the breath of Christ, the first Comforter. Thus, from the perspective of the inward aspect, Christ and the Spirit are one.<p>Now we need to go on to see that if we have only the outward aspect of the Spirit, the aspect of the Spirit as another Comforter revealed in chapter fourteen, but not the inward aspect, the Spirit as Christ&#8217;s breath revealed in chapter twenty, we shall not be able to experience the Spirit as another Comforter. Rather, we shall know the Spirit as another Comforter merely in doctrine. What we have in chapter fourteen is the doctrine concerning another Comforter. In that chapter we do not yet have the experience of this Spirit. In order to experience the Spirit as another Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, we need the inward aspect of the Spirit, the aspect of the Spirit as the breath of Christ. When we have the Spirit as Christ&#8217;s breath, then we can experience the Spirit as another Comforter.<p>Some may say, &#8220;Praise the Lord, the Holy Spirit is the second Comforter!&#8221; However, they may have only a doctrine, not any enjoyment or experience of the Spirit. But when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, breathing Him in as the life-giving Spirit, we enjoy the holy breath, and this breath is actually the Spirit as another Comforter. How we are comforted when we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus&#8221;! How much we enjoy this Comforter by calling on the Lord&#8217;s name! As we call on the Lord, the second Comforter becomes the breath for our enjoyment. The Lord breathed out this Comforter, and we breathe Him in. This is spiritual breathing, spiritual exhaling and inhaling. Through the Lord&#8217;s exhaling and our inhaling we enjoy His breath, and this breath is the second Comforter.<h2 class=head1>OUTWARD FACTS AND INWARD EXPERIENCE</h2><p>If we do not enjoy the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence, we shall not be ready to enjoy His visible presence. Likewise, if we do not have inward experience, we shall not be able to share in the outward facts. This principle applies not only to the truth concerning the Spirit, but applies to all biblical truths. Of course, we must first have the outward fact. Then we must turn this fact into inward experience. When the outward turns to the inward, it will become practical, experiential, and enjoyable. Although the inward aspect is invisible, it is very real. Applying this to the Spirit, in chapter fourteen we have the fact, the doctrine, of the second Comforter, and in chapter twenty we have the enjoyment, the experience, of this Comforter as Christ&#8217;s breath.<p>In chapter twenty-one we have something even more than simply the experience and enjoyment of the Comforter: we have the practical living by the Comforter. Do you know who this Comforter is in actuality? The Comforter is the Lord Jesus. In chapter twenty-one, the Lord who manifested Himself to the disciples is the real Comforter as the breath who dwells in the disciples. However, it was necessary for the disciples to learn how to live by this indwelling Comforter in a practical way.<p>Our experience today should be the same as that of the disciples in chapters twenty and twenty-one. We not only have an outward Christ, but we also have an inward Christ. We have the pneumatic Christ dwelling within us for our practical, daily living. Just as the disciples were trained in John 21, we also need to learn how to live by this indwelling pneumatic Christ. May we all be helped by the view presented in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John to have a practical Christian living by this wonderful pneumatic Christ.</body></html>
