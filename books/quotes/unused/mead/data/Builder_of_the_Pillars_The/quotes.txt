[1]  The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple built by Solomon was the two pillars 1 Kings 7:15-22 .
[2]  Whereas the pillars in 1 Kings 7 refer to the building of the temple of God in the Old Testament, the pillars in Galatians 2:9 refer to the building of God s house in the New Testament, and the pillar in Revelation 3:12 refers to the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom and in eternity.
[3]  The Bible not only mentions Hiram s name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself.
[4]  Let us now see the constituent, or the constitution, of a Hiram.
[5]  We need to know the constitution of those who are builders, not of the building generally, but of the pillars specifically.
[6]  Firstly, Hiram s mother was a woman of the daughters of Dan 2 Chron 2:14 .
[7]  No one can tell whether Dan here refers to the tribe of Dan or to the city of Dan Nonetheless, it is certain that it refers to people from Dan, for the city of Dan was also of the people of the tribe of Dan Hiram s father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre, a pagan country.
[8]  How could he be of the tribe of Naphtali, since his mother was of Dan and his father of Tyre?
[9]  The tribe of Dan is the tribe of idolatry that caused God s people to stumble and fall from God s way.
[10]  Spiritually speaking, in God s eyes Paul s mother was also a daughter of Dan We all must confess that our mothers are also those of Dan If you would become a builder of pillars, you must firstly admit that you are a person born in sin.
[11]  Hiram s father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre 1 Kings 7:14 .
[12]  I do not know who Paul s mother was, but, spiritually speaking, I am certain that she was a daughter of Dan, a daughter of the tribe of the serpent.
[13]  In the vision of the burning bush God seemed to be telling Moses, Moses, I will make you burning, but I will not burn you.
[14]  Although there seems to be no reason for Hiram to be of the tribe of Naphtali, the Bible clearly tells that he was of this tribe.
[15]  I certainly prefer to be one of the tribe of Naphtali, trusting in God, walking upon the high places, and living in the resurrected Christ for God s building.
[16]  How marvelous that his history not only records that his mother was of the tribe of the serpent and that his father was of the nation of commerce, a country related to Satan, but that he became one of the tribe of Naphtali.
[17]  The Tyrian father, the source of secular skill, had to die that the son who learned this skill through the worldly father may be released from the worldly tie.
[18]  Although the Tyrian father must die, the Danite mother, our human existence, must remain as a widow.
[19]  Young people, if you take this word, after a number of years you will be able to say, Lord, I thank You for that word about the Tyrian father and Danite mother.
[20]  I have earned a doctor s degree, and the father of this degree has died, but the Danite mother still lives.
[21]  If you are like this, you will certainly be useful in the Lord s hand.
[22]  Although we believe that the Lord is coming soon, we should still expect to have a long life on the earth for the Lord s use.
[23]  In my early ministry I repeatedly prayed Solomon s prayer for wisdom in coming in and going out among God s people 1 Kings 3:7, 9 .
[24]  BEING USEFUL FOR GOD S BUILDING ONLY IN RESURRECTION
[25]  The secular skills we gain will only be useful for God s building in resurrection, that is, after the worldly father has died and we, the learned son, have been transferred into the tribe of Naphtali.
[26]  After your Tyrian father has died and your Danite mother has become widowed, you must not remain a natural person.
[27]  Although your Tyrian father has died, your widowed Danite mother continues to exist, and you are in resurrection, you still need to come to the church because this is where God s building is.
[28]  If your Tyrian father dies, your Danite mother goes on living as a widow, and you are in resurrection and have come to Jerusalem, then you will be useful for God s building.
