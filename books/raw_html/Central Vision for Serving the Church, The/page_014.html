<h1 class="title">SEEING THE MYSTERY<br />
OF GOD AND CHRIST IN THE BIBLE<br />
TO WORSHIP AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD THROUGH PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>No matter how often we have read the Bible, certain things are not easy for us to understand, because they are incompatible with our concepts&mdash;our natural thoughts, cultural influence, and religious notions. The things in the Bible that seem to match our concepts are easy for us to receive, because our concepts are a part of us. In other words, instead of receiving the Bible into us, we often apply our concepts to the Bible. In order for us to understand the thought of the Bible, we need to pray-read.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING A VISION OF THE MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We need to see a vision of the mystery of God and Christ in the Bible. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is a great mystery. This mysterious God is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, Christ, the Holy Spirit, life, light, holiness, and righteousness. He is whatever we need. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.&rdquo; In this verse there are at least six titles: <em>child, Son, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father,</em> and <em>Prince of Peace.</em></p>
<p>What is revealed in the Bible concerning the riches of God&rsquo;s being is unspeakable. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us,...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; In verse 29 the Word who became flesh is also spoken of as the Lamb of God, and in verse 32 the Spirit, who descended upon Him, is signified by a dove. In John 1 God is the Word becoming flesh, He is grace and reality, He is the Father, He is the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, and He is the Lamb with the dove, that is, the Holy Spirit. Chapter 1 reveals the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Our God is too mysterious.</p>
<p>This mysterious God desires to work Himself into us. In the bread-breaking meeting most saints like to call hymn #136 in the Chinese hymnal. This is a good hymn, but it speaks of the grace of God in a superficial way. It can be compared to the rind of the watermelon. When we buy a watermelon, we eat the flesh, not the rind. Many Christians enjoy God in a superficial way; it is as if they are eating the rind of a watermelon, not the flesh. The hymns that we select show the extent to which we are in our natural concepts or in the vision of the mysterious God.</p>
<p>When we compiled the hymnal, we did consider this matter of the &ldquo;rind&rdquo; and the &ldquo;flesh.&rdquo; Since a watermelon must have both rind and flesh, we kept the &ldquo;rind&rdquo; hymns. However, we must learn to eat the &ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; because the essence and nutrients are in the flesh. We must not eat only the rind. The saints seldom call hymns on experiencing Christ as life, such as <em>Hymns,</em> #841 and #501, or hymns on Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, such as #450 in the Chinese hymnal and <em>Hymns,</em> #612. Some may not even know the tune to these hymns. We do not call these hymns, because we lack a vision of the treasure within these hymns. These hymns are on the riches of Christ who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, is in us to be our supply. Regrettably, the brothers and sisters do not know how to appreciate these hymns. They prefer to sing &ldquo;rind&rdquo; hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE DEEPER THINGS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>God created all things in the universe with two sides, an outside and an inside. The human body has skin on the outside and flesh and blood on the inside. Health problems that are related to the skin and flesh are not as serious as problems related to the blood. When we consider a person as a whole, his body is his outer person, and his spirit is his inner person. We often tell believers to turn to the spirit and to live God out from the spirit. These actions involve our inner person, not our outer person. This is revealed in the Word of God. The Chinese Confucian classics also have a concept related to the inner person. &ldquo;The Great Learning&rdquo; in <em>The Book of Rites</em> says, &ldquo;The way of great learning is to develop the bright virtue.&rdquo; The ancient Chinese sages discovered that there is a bright virtue within man, which is part of the innate human nature created by God. Metaphysicists hold different interpretations of this bright virtue, but it is generally considered to be man&rsquo;s conscience. Consequently, the development of the bright virtue focuses on the inner development of the conscience, rather than on outward improvement.</p>
<p>Metaphysicist Wang Yang-ming of the Ming Dynasty said that self-cultivation must start from the root, which is man&rsquo;s innate knowledge of good and innate ability to do good. A person who tries to improve himself outwardly is like a tree without roots or like water without a fountainhead; he will eventually dry up. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good refer to the bright virtue, which is man&rsquo;s conscience. The ancient sages, however, knew only about man&rsquo;s God-created conscience, but the Triune God has entered into our regenerated spirit. This surpasses the bright virtue, the innate knowledge of good, and the innate ability to do good. The latter are related to man&rsquo;s God-created human nature, which is good, but God has not been added to these components of our human nature. The Chinese sages and metaphysicists discovered that man&rsquo;s problem is inward, not outward. However, they did not see that God could enter into man&rsquo;s spirit through regeneration.</p>
<p>Many teachings in Christianity are quite shallow and do not have much depth. For example, Christians usually emphasize only a few verses in the Gospel of John, such as, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (1:29; 3:16; 10:11). These verses speak of God&rsquo;s redemption and love, but they are still the &ldquo;skin.&rdquo; The Gospel of John speaks of deeper things. For example, the word <em>in</em> is often used in this Gospel (4:14; 6:56; 10:38; 14:17). This is very significant. This Gospel concerns God who was in the beginning but whom man could not know because God dwelt in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16; John 1:1, 4; 8:12). Nevertheless, He became flesh through incarnation and was manifested among men (1:14). He was seen, known, and touched by men. Then in resurrection He became the Spirit of reality in order to enter into and abide <em>in</em> man (14:17).</p>
<p>In his first Epistle, John says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us)&rdquo; (1:1-2). These verses say that God is not only the Lamb of God; He is also the eternal life that has been reported to us. The Lamb is outward; the eternal life is inward. At the end of the book of Revelation the Lamb is on the throne, out from which proceeds a river of water of life (22:1). This verse speaks of two sides&mdash;the Lamb without and life within. However, many Christians see, contact, and touch only the Lamb, without knowing anything of life. Christian parents tell their children that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God, but rarely do they bring their children to see that the Lord Jesus is also God flowing out to be man&rsquo;s life. Many believers see the side of the Lamb but not the side of life. Even if they hear a word concerning life, they are not touched.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
