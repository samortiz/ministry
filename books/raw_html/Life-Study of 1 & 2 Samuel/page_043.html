<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PHILISTINES' PREPARATION<br>FOR WAR AGAINST ISRAEL</H2><P>In their preparation for war against Israel, the Philistines assembled 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen and "people like the sand that is on the seashore in multitude" (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SAUL'S DISOBEDIENCE</H2><P>In 13:8-15a we have a word concerning Saul's disobedience. In this war Saul's intention to act on his own for the building up of his monarchy was exposed. Saul's disobedience, which was observed by Samuel, meant that he had given up God. In his first conquest Saul behaved very well in the sight of the people and before the Lord, but in his second conquest he was disobedient and actually gave up God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In His Sinful Offering</H2><P>Saul's disobedience was exposed in the matter of his sinful offering (vv. 8-12). Saul was disobedient, yet he still offered something to God. Today's situation is exactly the same. People offer something to God for His service, but they disobey God and do not care for His purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. His Complaint</H2><P>Saul disobeyed, offering up a sinful offering, yet he complained against Samuel that Samuel had not come at the appointed time. At that time Samuel was the acting God. Saul had an appointment with Samuel, but Saul did not have the freedom to do whatever he liked. He should have been subordinate to Samuel. Apparently, Samuel was mistaken in his delay, but Samuel's delay exposed Saul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. His Excuse</H2><P>Saul's excuse for his disobedience was that the people were scattered from him and that the Philistines assembled themselves for fighting. There was no excuse for what Saul did. He should have waited for Samuel to arrive before taking any action.</P>
