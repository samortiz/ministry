<p>Pray-reading the Word is another way to be filled in spirit (5:18-19; Col. 3:16). In the meetings we need to avoid the flavor of being noisy when we pray-read. It is good to release the spirit, but if we are loud, we will lose the flavor of prayer and of reading. Sometimes we may utter longer sentences in order to improve our pray-reading, but the sentences should not be too long. Sometimes we may utter three to five short sentences. In this way we will have a rich flavor when we pray-read.</p>
<p>We should avoid taking the easy way and being methodical. We should not turn a practice into a procedure. That is to follow rules. We need to exercise our spirit in order to avoid being methodical. Whether we are reading the Bible, pray-reading, or singing, we should avoid following a procedure. Instead, we should always open to the Lord and allow the Holy Spirit to flow freely. What we do must be in spirit, not according to the letter. We must have an open spirit, and we must be in spirit because the reality of the church is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have the reality of the church in our spirit, we must first be filled with God. When we are filled with God, our mind will be occupied with the Spirit, and we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). In order to have the reality of the church, we also need to put on the new man. When we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, we put on the church as the new man (v. 24) and live in the church. The new man is the church; hence, to put on the new man is to put on the church and to live in the church. When we have our living and walk in the spirit, we are in the church life. This is what the Lord desires to gain.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want merely a group of people who are saved and who pursue Him by reading the Bible, praying, and attending meetings. This will not satisfy His heart. We must be filled in our spirit with the Spirit and allow Him to occupy our whole being. This is the way that we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we put off our old manner of living, old society, and old relationships. This is also the way that we put on the new man, which is the church. The new man is a matter of our living. Hence, when we put on the new man, we are in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To have the reality of the church is to be the dwelling place of God in spirit (2:22). Our spirit is the dwelling place of God. This means that we are built together in spirit, not only in the Holy Spirit but even more in our human spirit, to be the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Then God will have a resting place on earth, and He will make His home in our hearts (3:17). Our living will be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, His resting place. God is in heaven, but He is longing to gain a dwelling place on earth. When we are God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we will not be occupied with sins, nor will we love the world or care for our self. We will be built together in the new man to be a dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING THE ARMY OF GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we have the reality of the church, we will not only be God&rsquo;s dwelling place but also His army, and we will fight the spiritual warfare (6:10-20). This spiritual warfare will be fought in our spirit by means of all prayer and petition, taking the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God. We should pray at every time in spirit. This does not refer to praying for ordinary things but to spiritual warfare, that is, dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy with prayer and using prayer to deal with the authority of darkness. On the one hand, the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place for Him to make His home, and on the other hand, the church is an army that fights for God in order to hasten the coming of His kingdom.</p>
<p>This is the reality of the church. This reality is Christ, and it is Christ being mingled with us. The reality of the church is our living together in spirit to become the dwelling place of God and the army of God. The reality of the church is entirely a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING METHODS AND REGULATIONS AND<br />
DOING ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the reality of the church is in our spirit. We need to drop our procedures, methods, rituals, regulations, and practices. In our daily life we must live in the spirit and allow the Lord to be our person. Instead of following methods or ordinances in the meetings, every saint should function according to the Spirit. We do not need to sing first or to pray first or even to read the Bible first. When we read the Bible, we do not need to follow a particular method. All our activities should be in our mingled spirit. Then the Lord will be expressed, and He will gain a dwelling place and an army. This is what the Lord desires to gain today.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should not read the Bible or pray. We should read the Bible with our spirit, and we should pray with our spirit. We must do everything in our spirit. Then our meeting life and our daily life will be one living rather than two detached lives. Our meetings will be the expression of our living. Then our meetings will not be a performance; they will be a testimony.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us, and may His precious blood cover us so that we learn to turn to our spirit and practice dropping everything old. If we exercise to live in our spirit in our daily life, everything we do in the meetings will be according to the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
