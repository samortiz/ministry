<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>John said that "our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him [Witness Lee]." A servant of the Lord who ministers the word of God to the saints is very much related to the saints, and the saints are very much related to him. Hence, such a relationship is not only right but also needed. Therefore, the saints' "going on" and their relationship with each other and with the church should depend on their relationship to the one who ministers the word of God to them. This also is needed. If there were not such a thing, the church could not be healthy and would be left in a miserable state.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>12. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Application of the Church Ground<br>in a Divisive and Sectarian Way</H2><P>"...We have...applied this teaching [concerning the ground of oneness] in a divisive and sectarian way, so that we divide ourselves from other Christians. This is due to an improper attitude and application of the truth....I feel that in the local churches we have become very narrow and small; narrow in view, in our outlook, and in our reception of other saints..."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>To take the ground of oneness requires us to be separated from divisive and sectarian Christians, because they are on a divisive and sectarian ground. This does not mean that we are divisive and sectarian. We are standing on the ground of oneness; they are remaining on the ground of division. Thus, the taking of the ground of oneness should not be condemned as "an improper attitude and application of the truth."</P><P>Further, our taking of the ground of oneness surely makes us "narrow and small," because the majority of Christians are taking the broad way and the way of greatness, which we would not take in following Jesus today on this earth outside the camp, bearing His reproach (Heb. 13:13). However, this does not mean that we are "narrow in view." By standing on the ground of oneness, our view has been very much broadened to be the broad view that the Head, Christ, holds over His entire Body universally. And "in our reception of other saints" we are absolutely not narrow; rather, we are as broad as the Lord is in this matter, because we receive, as the Lord and God do (Rom. 14:3; 15:7), every kind of genuine Christian who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hearts are for them, and our arms and bosom are open to them. Yet regardless of how broad our view is in the receiving of other saints, the majority of the saints will not come to us, because they prefer, and some insist, to remain in their denominations or divisive groups, not having the broad view to care for the whole Body of Christ.</P>
