   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE IS THE WAY, THE REALITY, AND THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once when Christ Jesus was about to leave the world, He spoke of a very amazing doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, this doctrine is again closely related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said, "I am the way and the reality and the life" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you have heard others quote this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the way to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the way to overcome the temptations of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is His own teaching!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the ways to victory are Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also said that He is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have often heard people say that there is reality in So-and-so's words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes when someone puts forth a theory, we call it reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In geometry, when we have proved that this equals that, we say that we found a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the reality that Christ Jesus speaks of is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He does not merely preach a doctrine and ask you to work it out yourself; He is the very life-power to perform what He preaches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Religion tells you to be honest and not to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Maybe someone has come and told you, "Exercise yourself not to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time you lie just bite your tongue once."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I think that if we were able to recognize every lie we told, our tongue would be in two pieces before the day was over!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since our life is a human life, there is no possibility for us to not lie or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life of man is absolutely impotent in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Merely to give you some nice, lofty doctrines, while leaving it up to you to work them out, is not the way of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible says that He makes you able.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That ability is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you are in Him, He is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He can make you not lie, no matter what kind of a person you are!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>WHAT FOUNDERS OF OTHER RELIGIONS CANNOT DO</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No other founder of a religion is great enough to uphold these three items: the way, the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of man's experiences are included in these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you do something, you always have to decide whether or not it is worth doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This consideration is a weighing of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the decision is made, you have to find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And after the way, you must have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever you set out to accomplish something, you always have to pass through these three steps: the way, the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All three are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are not given reality first, then the way, and then left to yourself to find the life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every one of these three items is found in one person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you have Him, every problem will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as there is a way to Him, everything will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>JUST BE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we look at a few passages in the Bible, we easily discover that when the Bible mentions a doctrine, it always says that it is "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The words "in Christ" are constantly mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some passages say, "by Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But "by Christ" is not the best translation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is better in those instances to translate them as "through Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not give things to us directly; they have to go "through Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition, there are phrases like "with Christ" and "together with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They show the position Christ occupies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything has to be through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Receiving Him is receiving His doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without Him it is useless to have any of His doctrines.</S>
