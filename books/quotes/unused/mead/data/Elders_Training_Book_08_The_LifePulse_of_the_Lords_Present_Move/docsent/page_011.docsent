   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES TO BE THE SAME,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TAKING THE WAY OF HOME GATHERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The contents of Book 7 in this series were given as a preparation for this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now around this globe more than six hundred churches will take the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These churches will be like a caravan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If all the cars are driving and you do not drive, your car may be crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the churches on the whole earth will be going on in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The churches in New Zealand, Australia, Ghana, Taiwan, the United States, and everywhere will take the same way as a great local church caravan moving and traveling through this globe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the present situation some may be taught and encouraged to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To them all the local churches should be different and the teaching and leadership of the Lord s ministry do not fit into their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now you should realize why the eight chapters in Book 7 are a preparation to this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not saying that this kind of church should be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forget about this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some United States citizens do not have any idea about fighting, yet they enjoy this country to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Somebody, though, is fighting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They may be taking advantage of the fighters, but they are still citizens of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should consider the churches who want to be different as local churches, but we cannot bring them in to fight the battle for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need every church to be a fighter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose the six hundred churches throughout the globe were all different from one another and that each church went its own way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where then would the impact be?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This would be like the age of the Judges in which there was no king and everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Gideon chose three hundred men to fight the battle for the Lord, they all became the same and they fought the battle for all of Israel Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>7:7, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need such churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever we go, it would be wonderful if all the churches were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One particular news publication recently reported that during the past fifty years the Muslims have increased five hundred times, from two hundred million to the present one billion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the same period Hinduism increased one hundred seventeen percent, Buddhism by sixty-three percent, and Christianity by forty-seven percent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even Buddhism got more increase than Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Muslims have such a high increase because they are all unified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Basically speaking, all the Muslims have one way regardless of their nationality or country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity, on the other hand, is weakened by all the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother who is contacting some Jewish people said that some of them have said, If Christianity is true, why do you have so many denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This annuls the power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need for others to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We ourselves are opposing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I came to this country, I taught the truth from the Bible, and I was opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In mainland China some of the faithful brothers were judged and arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The policemen secretly told these brothers, You did not make any mistake or do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know you are innocent people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only problem is that your people are fighting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That meant that other Christians were fighting against them by contacting the government, so the policemen had to come and arrest them at the order of the government.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a shame to the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We Christians have lost our impact by our being different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If only all the Christians in the United States were the same, what power and impact there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This would not only take the entire United States but also the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But where is such a thing today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christians are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not only fighting against us but against each other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The teaching that encourages the believers to be different is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why I studied the New Testament again to find any hint that there should be different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more I studied, the more I realized that all the churches should be identical see Book 7 chapter four .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because the Muslims around the world are one, their increase was fivefold in the last fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The churches around the globe do have a certain amount of fellowship; this is our impact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we must learn to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our practice has to be in the sphere of the revelation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The home gatherings are something in the realm and even at the center of this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will never cause any trouble to produce divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The way of home gatherings is the biblical way, the way ordained by God and initiated by the moving Spirit at the very start of God s New Testament economy.</S>
