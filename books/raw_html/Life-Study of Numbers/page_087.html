<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the People's Dress</H2><P>In verses 37 through 41 we have the ordinance concerning the people's dress.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Making Tassels on the Corners<br>of the Garments and Putting upon the Tassel<br>of Each Corner a Cord of Blue</H2><P>"Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue" (v. 38). The Hebrew words translated "tassels on the corners" may also be rendered "fringes in the borders." Here "cord" signifies binding, and "blue" signifies heavenly; hence, a blue cord indicates a heavenly binding. For us today, this cord of blue signifies that, as children of God, our conduct and behavior should be beautiful and should be under the binding of the heavenly government.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Looking upon the Tassel and Remembering<br>All the Commandments of God and Doing Them</H2><P>The people were to look upon the tassel and remember all the commandments of God and do them, not seeking after their own heart and after their own eyes, according to which they committed fornications (v. 39). Thus they would remember and do their God's commandments and be holy to God.</P><P>According to the record of the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus wore this kind of garment. One day a woman came to touch the fringe (tassel) of His garment (Matt. 9:20-22), which signifies the beauty of His human virtues, from which His healing power issued forth. This indicates that we, the children of God, should walk under the heavenly binding. As people of the kingdom of the heavens, we should be bound not by the police or the law courts but by a heavenly binding, by the heavenly government and ruling. This will produce a beauty in our human conduct and virtue.</P>
