[1]  The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4; 1:4-5, 7-11, 13-14, 19-23 THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST
[3]  The burden of these messages is to point out that the church is absolutely organic.
[4]  We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational.
[5]  The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.
[6]  While Adam was sleeping, God took a rib out of his side, and with this rib He built a woman v. 22 . The rib that issued out of Adam s side eventually became Eve.
[7]  The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is an issue of the Father as the source of the divine Trinity, an issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity, and an issue of the Spirit as the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity.
[8]  as the Course of the Divine Trinity In His Redemption of the Father s
[9]  The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is the issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity in His redemption of the Father s chosen and predestinated ones that they may be recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal economy of God Eph 1:7-10 .
[10]  In Christ s redemption, fallen mankind gets recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal dispensation of God.
[11]  Ephesians 1:7-10 says: In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[12]  Christ s redemption not only recovers us back to His headship but also makes us God s inheritance for God s enjoyment.
[13]  The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.
[14]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 6:8a, 6; Eph 2:5-6a; 4:4; John 4:24a; 1 John 5:6b; John 16:13; Eph 2:18; Phil 1:19; Matt 28:19b; Rom 8:2; 2 Cor 3:6b; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b
[15]  Our organic union with the Lord is also in the Spirit.
[16]  Christ and the Spirit are not two separate persons.
[17]  God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him because we have the Spirit who is the reality of God.
[18]  God s Trinity was perfect, but it needed to be consummated.
[19]  The divine Trinity has been consummated in the processed Spirit, so the processed Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.
[20]  We may also say that the consummated Spirit is the consummated God as the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .
[21]  In chapter two we saw that the organic union of the divine Trinity is in the Spirit as the reality of Christ.
[22]  He is the very essence of the Triune God, the very reality of God, the reaching of the Triune God to man, the processed and compound Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[23]  The work of the Spirit is firstly to regenerate Christ s redeemed ones John 3:6b .
[24]  The Spirit uses Christ s death and resurrection and the divine life to regenerate us.
[25]  The Spirit also transforms the sanctified saints 2 Cor 3:18b .
[26]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST
[27]  When we talk about the building up of the organic Body of Christ, we are referring to the real, practical, and actual building up of a local church.
[28]  We must realize that we cannot build up any church outside of the divine life.
[29]  In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that the church was God s farm and that he planted and Apollos watered, but God made to grow vv.
[30]  The Spirit works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained.
[31]  The first item of the organic processes in the Spirit is our baptism into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[32]  Regeneration is by the Spirit as the reality of the resurrected Christ John 3:6b; 1 Pet 1:3 .
[33]  Baptism puts us into the consummated Triune God, and regeneration puts the embodiment of the consummated God into us.
[34]  At the time that we believed into Jesus and we were baptized into the consummated God, we got into Him and He got into us.
[35]  Another organic process in the Spirit that we experience is that we are sealed with the Spirit as the essence of God Eph 1:13 .
[36]  The Spirit s sealing us is to transfuse all that God is into our being, to saturate our being with the very essence of God.
[37]  We may say that being baptized into the Spirit, regenerated by the Spirit, and sealed with the Spirit form one group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.
[38]  As we drink of the Spirit and enjoy Him, we will be filled with Him as the essential Spirit of God.
[39]  Acts 13:52 says, And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.
[40]  This infilling of the Holy Spirit is essentially for life, not for power.
[41]  The infilling Spirit anoints us as the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who is the compound ointment 1 John 2:27; Exo 30:23-25 .
[42]  In the previous chapter, we saw nine of the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ.
[43]  When we are under the leading of the indwelling Spirit, we will live a life that is the life of a son of God.
[44]  THAT CHRIST MAY MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS
[45]  If we are living by the Spirit of life and walking by the mingled spirit, we will be strengthened by the Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts Eph 3:16-17a .
[46]  We are also supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .
[47]  In Acts 16:7 is the Spirit of Jesus, and in Romans 8:9 is the Spirit of Christ.
[48]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Spirit that can support us and sustain us to withstand all kinds of sufferings and to live a transcendent life, a resurrected life.
[49]  As long as we are being renewed and sanctified by the Spirit, we are also being transformed by the Spirit as the Lord in resurrection 2 Cor 3:17-18 .
[50]  As the transformed, tripartite man, we are becoming one couple with the processed Triune God.
[51]  The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed in many aspects, and the church life is the very Spirit in whom we live and according to whom we walk.
