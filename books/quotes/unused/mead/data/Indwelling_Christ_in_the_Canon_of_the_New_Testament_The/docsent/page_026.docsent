   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INDWELLING SPIRIT, THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT OF DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today, Christ as the indwelling Spirit indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The very Christ who is made everything to us is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And we are one spirit with Him, continually enjoying His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is made clear by the above mentioned verses and the last part of 1 Corinthians 15:45, The last Adam was made a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can never forget this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the Spirit of God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we see that this Spirit is Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then 1 Corinthians 12:13 shows us something more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For in One Spirit were we all baptized into one body...and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we have the Spirit that dwells in us, the life-giving Spirit, and the Spirit that is good for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you believe that these are three Spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all know that these three are just one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, we see that Jesus is just a kind of drink to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day we are drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all know that baptism is to put people into the water, and drinking is to put the water into people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is exactly what 1 Corinthians 12:13 says.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been baptized in one Spirit, and now we are all drinking of that one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also have seen that these two aspects are also recorded in Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Matthew, we were baptized into the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in John, this Triune God gets into us John 14:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now 1 Corinthians tells us the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been baptized into the Spirit and we are drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To drink of Christ as the Spirit is the way that we apply Him as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we say, O Lord Jesus, we take a drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By doing this, we partake of Jesus as our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are sorrowful, we drink of Him as our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we drink of Him in this way, the more we practically take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We don t live by ourselves anymore, but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are not many Christians that practice this kind of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do praise the Lord in the last few years, many saints among us have begun to practice in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet I still feel that our practice is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It must be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should never consider that we are professional in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All day long we must practice the drinking of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have all been put into Him Gal 3:27 , and He is made everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But He can only be everything to us by His indwelling, and we can only realize His indwelling by our drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All day long we must drink of this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the real drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our husband or wife begins to argue with us, we should not use our mouth to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, we must use our mouth to say, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While they are arguing, we must drink of the Lord Jesus in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by this drinking that we enjoy the indwelling of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And it is by His indwelling that He becomes everything to us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever we are going to do, we must say, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we are going to the store to make some purchases we must say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are beginning to argue with someone, first of all we must say, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems so simple, like the practice of a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But there is no other way that is so living, practical, real, and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit, and we must all learn to drink of Him again, and again, and again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I recently heard of a couple in New Zealand that drinks eleven cups of tea a day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That really seems to be a lot of drinking, but to drink eleven times of Jesus in a day is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must drink of Him hundreds of times.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you think that to drink of Jesus one hundred times in one day is too much?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It could never be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must learn to drink of Him countless times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>TWO ASPECTS IN ONE VERSE</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we can see that 1 Corinthians has one verse that puts the two aspects together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all have been baptized in one Spirit, and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be baptized into one Spirit is revealed in Matthew, and to drink of one Spirit is basically revealed in John John 7:37-39; 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now in 1 Corinthians we have one verse which puts these books together.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul is quite wise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In one short verse he covers Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all have been baptized into the Triune God, and now this wonderful One is our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all have been put into this wonderful water, and we all have been positioned to daily take this water into us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is by this daily drinking that He is made everything to us, and we learn to take Him as our person and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then eventually we become His expression on the earth as the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is all by the indwelling of Christ.</S>
