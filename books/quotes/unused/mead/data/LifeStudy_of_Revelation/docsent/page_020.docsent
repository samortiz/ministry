   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some have said that Christ is the originator, not the origination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the meaning here is not originator but origination.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that He is both the root and the branch of David.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once again, we see that He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the root, He is the first, the beginning, and the Alpha, and as the branch, He is the last, the end, and the Omega.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have pointed out in a previous message, Christ, the Son, is the Lion of the tribe of Judah 5:5 and the Lamb 5:6; 21:23; 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the Lion-Lamb.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Son is the Word of God 19:13 , the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because Christ is the Word, He and the Bible are one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not read your Bible without reading Him, and do not contact the Bible without contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we come to the Bible, we must realize that He Himself is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>W. The Morning Star</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 22:16 we see that the Son is the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Malachi 4:2, He is revealed as the Sun, but here He is revealed as the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His being the Sun is mainly related to the people on earth, but His being the morning star is related to His watchful, waiting believers.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Y. The Husband</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 21:2 we see that the New Jerusalem is the wife of Christ.</S>
