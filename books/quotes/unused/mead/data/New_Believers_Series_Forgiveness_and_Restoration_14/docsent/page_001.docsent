   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORGIVENESS AND RESTORATION Scripture Reading: Matt 18:21-35, 15-20; Luke 17:3-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should we do if a brother offends us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do when it is not we who have offended others but others who have offended us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we examine the above three portions of the Lord's Word, we find that we should not only forgive a brother who has offended us but we should also restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us first consider the matter of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. FORGIVING ONE'S BROTHER A. Being Required to Forgive</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 18:21-22 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Up to seven times?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke 17:3-4 says, "Take heed to yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The verses in Matthew say that we should forgive a brother seventy times seven times, not just seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The verses in Luke say that we have to forgive a brother who sins against us seven times a day, repents, and turns to us seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether or not his repentance is genuine, we must forgive him as long as he repents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not he is genuine is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Seven times is not too much, but seven times within one day is not that infrequent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose the same person does the same thing to you seven times a day, and suppose he says that he has sinned against you seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Would you still believe that his confession is genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am afraid that you would think that he was only confessing with his lips.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why Luke 17:5 says, "The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They felt that this was a problem to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was unthinkable to them that a brother could offend someone seven times in a day and then turn around to repent seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They could not believe it, and they said, "Lord, increase our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God's children should forgive even if they are called upon to do so seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a brother sins against you, you should not hold it against him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. God's Measure</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord continues with a parable in Matthew 18:23-27: "For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The slave owed ten thousand talents, which was a very large amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had no ability to repay because "he did not have the means to repay."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can never repay all that we owe God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is far more than what men owe us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a child of God arrives at a proper evaluation of his debt to God, he will generously forgive what his brother owes him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we forget the immensity of the grace we have received from God, we become merciless toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to see how much we owe God before we can see how little others owe us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The slave did not have the means to repay, and the master ordered him "to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, even if he sold all that he had, he still could not have repaid everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all."</S>
