[1]  CONTENTS The Life and the Way God's Eternal Purpose and God's Work The Release of the Life of Christ The Enlightenment of the Cross The Experience of the Cross The Requirements for Receiving the Cross Four Points Concerning Prayer for God's Work The Reality of the Church Being Baptized into Christ Bread Breaking Receiving Christ Living Out Christ Christian Growth Being Unable to do Anything Apart from the Lord The Church Being Christ
[2]  This book, composed of fourteen messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei in 1952, concerns the crucified Christ as the secret to Christian living and growth in life and as the way for God to accomplish His eternal purpose.
[3]  God's purpose is that Christ would mingle Himself with us to be our life and nature, that the two Christ and we would become one.
[4]  A GRAIN OF WHEAT ABIDING ALONE UNLESS IT FALLS INTO THE GROUND AND DIES
[5]  The Lord Jesus said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .
[6]  God requires that we be broken and crushed so that the Christ within us the glorious Christ, the Christ of holiness may be lived out through us.
[7]  CHRIST NEEDING BROKEN VESSELS TO BE CHANNELS OF LIVING WATER
[8]  Christ does not need whole vessels; instead, He needs broken vessels.
[9]  THOSE WHO ARE IN GOD'S HAND HAVING MANY WOUNDS
[10]  What Paul knew was of two aspects: one was Jesus Christ, and the other was Jesus Christ crucified.
[11]  EVERYTHING OF THE OLD CREATION HAVING BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
[12]  We have said many times that we have to follow the Lord to take the way of the cross.
[13]  The unique purpose of God in creating all things and mankind, in leading us through all kinds of environments, and in continually working in us in various ways is to mingle Himself with us that He may become our content, our life, and our nature.
[14]  Today many Christians teach people that there are heaven and hell, that man is sinful and evil, that man should fear God and repent to God, that Jesus Christ bore the sins of man and died for man on the cross to receive God's punishment on man's behalf, and that by believing in Him man will be saved.
[15]  Galatians 4:19 says, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you."
[16]  However, at this point Christ has not yet been formed in him because he has too little of the element of Christ.
[17]  THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH HINGING ON THE INCREASE OF THE ELEMENT OF CHRIST
[18]  Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[19]  Here Paul indicates that once we know Christ, we will progress and arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[20]  READING THE BIBLE FOR CHRIST TO INCREASE IN US
[21]  If Christ is mingled with us to one degree, we have one degree of spirituality.
[22]  Today although many people pray, they do not gain much of Christ.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE THE RELEASE OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST
[24]  THE DEATH OF THE CROSS DOING THE BREAKING WORK
[25]  THE LORD ENTERING INTO HIS BELIEVERS AS THEIR LIFE AFTER HIS RESURRECTION
[26]  THE CHURCH BEING THE EXTENSION AND THE SPREAD OF CHRIST
[27]  We all have had the kind of experience where we intend to do good, yet we are not able to do it.
[28]  We must realize, however, that because Christ has come into us, there is no good thing that we cannot do, and there is no good deed that we cannot perform.
[29]  If we think that to believe in Jesus is merely for us to obtain peace, joy, and blessing, then we only know the appearance of the treasure.
[30]  A CHRISTIAN'S POWER BEING IN CHRIST WHO LIVES IN US
[31]  If you have never had such an experience, I am afraid that you are not yet saved because you do not have God and His life in you.
[32]  In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified."
[33]  We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[34]  Christians preach Christ, telling people that Christ is the Savior and life of man, yet in their daily lives very few of them really experience Christ as life.
[35]  We really have to look to God that we may definitely know in our experience what it is to have Christ as our life and to know what is the cross of Christ.
[36]  THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH GOD'S PURPOSE
[37]  The central purpose of God is that He wants to become our life.
[38]  We must look to God to show us what Christ and the cross will accomplish in us and how we can know Christ and the cross.
[39]  CHRIST BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD AND THE CROSS BEING THE TERMINATION OF MAN
[40]  THE PURPOSE OF GOD'S SALVATION BEING TO PUT MAN ON THE CROSS
[41]  Day by day he lives under the light of the cross and is able to tell, in big or small things in his living, what is of the self and what is of Christ, which view is from the self and which view is from Christ, which idea is from the self and which idea is from Christ, which action is from the self and which action is from Christ.
[42]  Once we stop all of our activities, the Spirit of God will immediately have the ground in us and the opportunity to touch us and operate in us.
[43]  When we have more of this kind of experience, we will reach a stage at which Christ will not only stay in us, mingle Himself with us, and add Himself to us, but Christ will also live out through us.
[44]  Matthew 16:21-25 says, "From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.
[45]  NOT OUR BEING OBEDIENT TO THE BIBLICAL TEACHINGS, BUT THE LORD LIVING HIMSELF OUT THROUGH US
[46]  The Lord first bore the cross and then was crucified, but with us, we first are crucified, and then we bear the cross.
[47]  This portion says, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."
[48]  There is at least one verse in the Bible that shows us this matter, saying clearly and emphatically, "that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" v. 19 . Not only does God want to come into us and be mingled with us, but He also wants to fill us with all His riches all that He is and all that He has that we may become His fullness and expression.
[49]  THE FACTORS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR BELIEVERS TO EXPERIENCE THE TRIUNE GOD
[50]  We have to see from this portion in Ephesians how to be filled by the Triune God more and more through His indwelling, that is, how to be filled by God, Christ, and the Spirit.
[51]  The first step is faith that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith; the second step is love that we may be rooted and grounded in love.
[52]  God will never forsake us, so we do not need to worry about anything.
[53]  In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord told us that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, all that we need will be added to us 6:33 .
[54]  The second obligation we have toward the Triune God is to love Him.
[55]  GOD'S SPREADING FROM OUR SPIRIT TO OUR SOUL BEGINNING WITH OUR HEART
[56]  How can God spread into every part of our soul from our spirit?
[57]  CHAPTER SEVEN FOUR POINTS CONCERNING PRAYER FOR GOD'S WORK
[58]  First, we need to spend time specifically to pray that the saints would have more of a heart for the Lord.
[59]  This means that we have to pray to the Lord that the saints would have a heart that is sufficiently inclined toward the Lord and that every one of them would love the Lord.
[60]  We should not only pray that they would be saved and participate in the church life but that they would also be touched by the Lord and have a heart for Him not just any heart but a heart sufficiently inclined toward Him.
[61]  No. The Lord did not rebuke him; rather, He asked Peter gently and sympathetically, "Do you love Me more than these?" What the Lord meant was, "Do you love Me more than the sea? Do you love Me more than the world? Do you love Me more than your boat? Do you love Me more than your occupation? Do you love Me more than your fishing skill? Do you love Me more than your capability? Do you love Me more than your companions? Do you love Me more than the one hundred and fifty-three fish? Do you love Me more than these?"
[62]  Without John 21, there would not have been Acts 1.
[63]  On the one hand, the Spirit of God enters into us to fill us, and on the other hand, we enter into the Holy Spirit to know the spiritual things and to have the spiritual seeing, revelation, and understanding.
[64]  First Corinthians 1:22-23 says, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness."
[65]  Then verse 24 continues, "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[66]  The Jews require signs and the Greeks seek wisdom, but Paul clearly told us that Christ is the power of God, the wisdom of God, and that Christ is all.
[67]  A CHRISTIAN BEING ONE WHO HAS CHRIST IN HIM
[68]  Now we have to see how we who are saved can know more of Christ, be filled more with Christ, and have more experiences of Christ.
[69]  Not many Christians know what it is to love Christ, and not many Christians realize that if they do not love Christ, they will not be able to experience Christ or be filled with Him.
[70]  THE FIRST MARY BEING ONE WHO LOST HER OWN STATUS
[71]  If a person wants to allow Christ to be born in him, and if he wants to experience Christ's death and resurrection, this person must be a Mary.
[72]  Romans 6:3-5 says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
[73]  We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.
[74]  THE SECOND MARY KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING THE LORD'S DEATH
[75]  The content of the church is Christ, and the intrinsic reality of every single matter in the church is Christ Himself.
[76]  If we do not touch Christ and gain Christ, then even our worship and service will be meaningless.
[77]  Just as the reality of believing in the Lord is Christ's coming into us, and the reality of baptism is our union with Christ, so also all the services in the church should be related to Christ.
[78]  TO REMEMBER THE LORD BEING TO EAT THE LORD'S BODY AND DRINK THE LORD'S BLOOD
[79]  In the Bible we cannot find the Lord telling us to meditate on Him in our remembrance of Him.
[80]  EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD BEING TO RECEIVE THE LORD
[81]  From this we see that it is through His death that the Lord gave Himself to us.
[82]  If He had not died or shed His blood, He could not have any relationship with us and would not have a way to enter into us.
[83]  In breaking bread we turn to our spirit and through the symbols receive the Lord again and again.
[84]  Every time we break bread, we receive the Lord once more, and every time we break bread, we again contact the Lord who died and resurrected, touching Him in our spirit.
[85]  If we really see this, the next time we break bread, we will realize that inwardly we have been filled with too many other things so that the Lord is not able to find any place, any empty room, in us.
[86]  Colossians 3:4 says, "When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory."
[87]  TO BE SAVED BEING TO RECEIVE GOD'S LIFE IN ADDITION TO MAN'S LIFE
[88]  God's salvation is not only for the forgiveness of our sins and the washing away of our filthiness; God's salvation is to give Christ to us at the time we are saved.
[89]  When Christ enters into us, He becomes our life.
[90]  At the instant we are saved, we receive Christ as our life; that is, we receive God as life into us.
[91]  If the virtues we live out in our daily life are not Christ living out from within us, at the most we can say that we have done well and rightly, but we cannot say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[92]  If in our daily living we enjoy Christ, depend on Christ, fellowship with Christ, and are filled with Christ, then we can say that for us to live is Christ.
[93]  CHAPTER TWELVE CHRISTIAN GROWTH ALL SPIRITUAL MATTERS RELATED TO A CHRISTIAN DEPENDING ON CHRIST
[94]  God shows us clearly in His Word that all spiritual matters related to a Christian depend on Christ.
[95]  Whether it is our believing in the Lord, our baptism, or our breaking bread in remembrance of the Lord, everything in our Christian life depends on Christ.
[96]  God does not require that His children have a change in behavior or a desire to do good.
[97]  If we had the right understanding, we would know that our seeking God and our slothfulness in not seeking God are actually the same.
[98]  GOD WANTING MAN TO DENY HIMSELF AND LIVE BY CHRIST
[99]  We all must know this principle to the extent that we abhor ourselves and all of our living that comes out of ourselves.
[100]  I hope we can see that our spiritual life is Christ, our spiritual living is Christ, and our spiritual progress is also Christ.
[101]  Therefore, I hope that these words will shine on us that we may be enlightened to see that what God wants is just Christ Himself.
[102]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN BEING UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING APART FROM THE LORD
[103]  It seems that we do not need to rely on the Lord to preach the gospel, we do not need to rely on the Lord to visit the saints, and we do not need to rely on the Lord to serve Him.
[104]  Many Christians often ask, "What does the Lord want us to do?"
[105]  Based on this principle, we can examine our daily walk to see whether or not it is Christ Himself and whether or not it is the life of Christ passing through us and flowing out of us.
[106]  CHRIST BEING THE CENTER AND THE REALITY OF ALL OUR SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES
[107]  This does not mean that when we go out to preach the gospel, we do not need to tell people about God, sin, Jesus being the Savior, and the way to receive Him as their Savior and that we only need to tell them that we are transmitting Christ into them that they may become "grapes."
[108]  We have to let them know that we are Christians, we have Christ in us, we are branches of Christ as the vine, and we have come to contact them in order to transmit Christ into them.
[109]  If we have seen that spiritual reality is Christ Himself, when we go out to visit the saints, to shepherd the saints, or to teach the saints, we will hold on firmly to the principle that we are ministering Christ to them.
[110]  For this reason, we need to gain and experience more of Christ, because if we have not received the supply from Christ, it will be difficult for us to supply others, and if we have not experienced Christ, it will be difficult for us to nourish others.
[111]  When Paul wrote the book of Philippians in his old age, he still confessed that he did not have an adequate knowledge of Christ.
[112]  You are short of zeal because you do not have enough Christ, I am short of love because I do not have enough Christ, and he is short of faith because he does not have enough Christ.
[113]  If what a person ministers to the church is not Christ, and if the shepherding he renders to the saints is not Christ Himself, then even though he may receive praise from man, he will not receive praise from God, whether he is a deacon, an elder, or a serving one.
[114]  However, if we are in fellowship and contact with the Lord, whether we are elders or deacons, whether we are going to preach the gospel or going to visit people, once we contact them, Christ will be released through us, and they will gain Christ.
[115]  Whenever we sense that we are disconnected from Christ, we have to deal with it immediately.
[116]  Before we preach the gospel or preach the word, if we sense that we are not connected to Christ, we have to deal with this right away in order that we may be reconnected with the "electricity," the Spirit.
[117]  There is no problem with the Christ who is in us; however, if we do not abide in Christ or fellowship with Him but speak by ourselves in our mind and in our determination, Christ will be gone.
[118]  When we serve, we have to contact Christ; when we read the Bible, we have to contact Christ; when we preach the gospel, we have to contact Christ; when we talk, we have to contact Christ; when we pray, we have to contact Christ.
[119]  First Corinthians 12:12 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."
[120]  This mystery shows that not only is the Head of the church Christ but that the church as the Body of Christ is also Christ.
[121]  We can say that the reality of Christ is Christ Himself, the reality of spiritual matters is Christ Himself, and the reality of the church is also Christ Himself.
[122]  We all should be clear that from the beginning of our Christian life, all of our experiences including repentance, believing in the Lord, baptism, attending the meetings, and preaching the gospel are all experiences of Christ and are Christ Himself.
[123]  In John 15, the Lord Jesus clearly said, "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing" v. 5 . Apart from the Lord, apart from Christ, we cannot even talk about service.
[124]  Only when we are in union with Christ will what we do be something that Christ does through us, and only this has spiritual value to God.
[125]  Before we go to clean the meeting hall, if we first have fellowship with the Lord at home and let the Lord supply our whole being, then when we clean the windows or the chairs, there will be the overflow of Christ Christ will come out of us.
[126]  THE MANIFESTATION OF FUNCTIONS GIFTS THROUGH THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[127]  Whether or not the various functions of our body can be expressed depends entirely on our growth in life.
[128]  Although we are saved and are members of the Body of Christ, due to our lack of growth in life, we cannot prophesy for the Lord, even though we may be the mouth.
[129]  You are a member of Christ because Christ is in you; I am a member of Christ because Christ is in me; and everyone who is a member of Christ is so because Christ is in him.
[130]  We have to see what it is to be a member of the Body of Christ.
[131]  If Christ has not entered into you, you are merely an individual and not a member of the Body of Christ.
[132]  When Christ comes into you, you become a member of the Body of Christ, but you still may not have a function because Christ has not yet been developed in you.
[133]  If we do not have any function, it is because although we may already have the life of Christ and the Spirit of Christ in us, we have not given Him the opportunity and ground to grow and develop in us.
[134]  THE MANIFESTATION OF GIFTS BEING ENTIRELY DEPENDENT UPON US
[135]  How much of our gift is manifested and how useful we can be in the Lord's hands do not depend on the Lord but depend entirely on us.
[136]  If these questions have not been answered, and we have not dealt with them, even though we are saved, Christ still will not be able to grow in us or be developed in us so that our function can be manifested.
[137]  We should never think that we are not gifted; instead, we should go to the Lord and pray, asking the Lord to have mercy on us that we may be willing to hold on to Him, to give Him the ground in us, and to let Him gain us so that the life in us may be developed.
