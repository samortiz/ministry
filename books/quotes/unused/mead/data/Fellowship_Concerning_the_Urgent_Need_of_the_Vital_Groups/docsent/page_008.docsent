   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The instructions I am giving now concerning the new way are different from what I spoke in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Taiwan I charged you to visit people and to get them baptized immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But today I do not encourage you to get people baptized in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, when you visit people, do not speak too quickly to them concerning the Bible, God, Christ, or salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do, people may think that you are too religious and that they cannot come up to your standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may be turned away by your enthusiasm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In your first visit with someone who has been recommended to you, do not stay very long; the shorter the visit, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A short visit will give the one who is visited a good taste, so that he will welcome another visit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not spoil the taste of those whom you visit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the first visit, do not speak too much concerning spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As you visit a second or third time, you may begin to say something concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may need to go a few times before you are able to get a person saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle is: the slower, the better; the slower it is, the safer it is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The slower the pace is, the more certain it is that you can gain that person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have said that if we could get one real fruit in a year through our contact, that would be a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may even be possible to get one person every three months.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Generally speaking, one gained in this way may be steady.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Baptism also should not be done in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Try to avoid baptizing people in a bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean that it should not be done at all; it depends on the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, any place where there is water a baptismal tank, a bathtub, a pool, a river, or the sea is good for baptizing people, but when you go out to visit people in a regular way, you do not need to baptize people in their bathtubs in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a new one is saved, it may be best not to speak to him immediately concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should continue to meet with him in his home or in your group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then, as the Lord leads, speak with him about the church and bring him to the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SPECIAL MEETINGS FOR NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would also propose that, if possible, the church set up special meetings for the new ones periodically, one for the Caucasians, another for the Chinese-speakers, and another for the Spanish-speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can bring your new ones to the special meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Several groups can bring their new ones to such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In that special meeting, the first thing to do is to give them a short message concerning baptism and baptize the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because they are baptized in a baptistry with a number of people surrounding them, they will feel very stately.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There should be a joyful celebration with many praises to the Lord for their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone should shake hands with the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this you can have the Lord s table with all the baptized ones and fellowship with them about the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we practice in this way, we will surely be able to bring Caucasians into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the practice of the group meetings, as much as possible the Caucasian saints should not be grouped together with the Chinese saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even someone who is not Caucasian by race may be Caucasian in principle because either he was born in America, he speaks typical American English, or his spouse is Caucasian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is only a principle; it is not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever way allows us to have a success, we will take that way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In principle, all the Caucasian brothers and sisters should group with Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should go to visit Caucasians, not Chinese or Spanish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rate of increase among the Chinese may be higher than among the Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, we may be able to gain ten new ones among the Chinese within two weeks, but it may take three months to gain two Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Still, this labor is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let the Chinese saints group with the Chinese and go to visit the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let the Spanish saints visit the Spanish, and let the Korean saints visit the Koreans.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a larger church that has a Chinese-speaking meeting, there should also be a Chinese baptism meeting in the way that I described earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the beginning, such a meeting may not take place every week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But eventually, such a special meeting for baptism and the practice of the Lord s table with the new ones should be conducted every week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a place where there is only one baptistry, the different meetings by the different groups could be scheduled for different times.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, this is just a general idea; for the details we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the New Testament there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the long run the group meetings may need special, spiritual shepherding or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After a few months one group may increase to more than fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time the group can divide into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the brothers who formed the group initially can teach and shepherd, but we cannot expect that the new ones will be able to go very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we must consider the need for shepherding and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, when we have many groups, there will be a great need for shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must study the situation and pray very much about the coming days.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the number of group meetings is very large, the care for the groups cannot be done in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I hate to use the word leaders, after much consideration, I find it difficult to avoid the need for leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to our present practice, we have only elders, but if the number of groups in a locality grows to be a big number, the relatively small number of elders will not be able to take care of the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the long run there will be a great need, but at the present time we must take the initial step to form the groups in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the new start with the group meetings, the remaining aspects of the church s present practice can remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While we are practicing the new group meetings, we should still maintain the regular meetings of the church.</S>
