   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Falling under God's Governmental Hand</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being a Serious Matter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider one portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After Moses smote the rock in Meribah Num 20:10-12 , both he and Aaron fell under God's governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Aaron failed, God still allowed him to remain a priest and restored his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though he wore the priestly robe, God nevertheless told him that he would not be able to live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moses also did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One when he was by the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's hand was upon his servants, and Aaron and Moses could not enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you see the basic principle here?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is God's government!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot pin down our God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot guarantee that God will always treat us the same way as before.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At a certain point, God may change His way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may change even what we consider to be the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible is full of such stories.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, when the Israelites reached Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran, spies went up to spy out the land Num 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they saw that it would take two people to carry a cluster of grapes, they realized that the land was a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But they became afraid and refused to enter into that land, because they saw that the people who dwelt in that land were of great stature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their own sight the Israelites were as grasshoppers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, all but two of them died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Joshua and Caleb were the only two persons who would go into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, the people confessed their sins and wanted to go in. God still treated them as His people and was gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, they could no longer have a part in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's government had changed!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, the very day that you begin your Christian life, you should set a hope before you that you will stay on the course that God has measured to you, all the way to the end. Do not live loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please bear in mind that even though God may be merciful, He can change His way!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's governmental hand will never let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's governmental hand is indeed a serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I know of a brother who was clearly called by the Lord to set aside his career to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He went home for a visit but could not bring himself to quit his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wanted to be a good Christian, but he did not want to set aside his career or spend his life for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since then he is sometimes weak and sometimes strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it is impossible for him to turn back to this way!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please bear in mind that our greatest fear is God's disciplining hand; we do not know when His hand will come upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God may let us go, even if we rebel ten times, but He may not let us go the eleventh time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, God will not let some people go the first time they rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not know when God will catch up with us!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers, please bear in mind that God's government is not something under our control!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does things according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know of a sister who at one time wanted to consecrate herself to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later she married, and her marriage was not a very good one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as she made such a move, the light ceased to shine in her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no way to ask her to return to this way now.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's governmental hand is upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we cannot turn her back no matter how hard we try.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Light is shut off from her; it is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is as if a veil is hanging in front of her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no way for her to see the light again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>H. Trying Our Best to Be Obedient to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>and to Ask for His Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, brothers, the first thing we should do is to try our best to obey the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us, and may He keep us from falling into His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if we should fall into His governmental hand, we should not try to get out hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not resist and do not flee.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not give up on one basic principle to obey God at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not asking you to obey by yourself, because you cannot obey by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to enable us to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only when the Lord has mercy on us will we be able to get through in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Lord, have mercy on me, or I will not be able to get through in this."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must always ask the Lord to grant us mercy to get through and to not fall into His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God's governmental hand is already upon us and we are already sick or in the midst of some dire experiences or difficulties, we must remember to not resist God's government with our fleshly hand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as His governmental hand is upon us, we should learn to humble ourselves under His mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must say, "Lord, this is Your work!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is Your arrangement!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I gladly yield myself to it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am willing, and I accept it!"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God's governmental hand was upon Job whom God could easily have spared , the more that Job accepted it, the better it was for him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more he talked about his own righteousness, the worse his condition became.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's governmental hand often does not remain upon a person all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Personally, I believe that when God's governmental hand is upon a person, it can easily be removed by the prayer of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the precious lesson we find in James 5, which tells us that the elders of the church can lift God's governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>James said that the prayer of faith can cause a person to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If he has committed any sin, his sin can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a brother is enlightened concerning this matter, and the church prays for him, very often God will lift His governmental and disciplining hand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once when I was talking to Miss M. E. Barber, she related an interesting story to me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A brother had done something terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Later, he repented and came to Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She said to the man, "You have repented and have turned back, have you not?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now you must go to the Lord and tell Him, I was once a vessel in the hand of the potter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now the vessel is broken.'</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not force the Lord to do anything by saying, Lord, You must make me another kind of vessel.'</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You must humble yourself and pray, Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let me be a vessel again!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I can no longer insist on being a vessel by myself.'</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord can make you a vessel unto honor, or He can make you a vessel unto dishonor."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many people still want to be the same kind of vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They insist that the Lord make them glorious all the time, but sometimes blessing can come out of a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, I can tell you this: We have all passed through many dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I have fallen into God's hand many times; God's governmental hand has been upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must admit that we often get to know God's will even more through His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is no way to dodge it; we can only humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We can do nothing except humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>As time goes by, we will see that it is impossible to avoid or dodge any issue.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have to humble ourselves under God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can only say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What You have arranged for me is always the best.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I can only humble my heart before You!"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must not be careless or loose about these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I know of a sister who came to see me about marrying a certain man.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I told her that as far as I knew, she should not marry him because he did not seem to be a trustworthy Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>She said that she was confident that the marriage would work.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Seven or eight months after her marriage, she wrote a very long letter to me and said, "I know now I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I did not listen to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I know now that it was a great mistake!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I replied, "From now on, you have only one way humble yourself under God's mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Even though you tell me about your problem, I cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>No one can help you.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You have already fallen into God's governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you struggle and rebel, your vessel will only break, and you will only sacrifice your own future."</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I warned her in a strong way in the letter that she should not even try to write another letter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We must remember that God's government is most serious!</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A thought often comes to me: What can I compare the present condition of the church to?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The church is like a potter's house with many broken vessels, broken tubs, and broken vases strewn everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>One finds broken vessels everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is the situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I say again, we must learn to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand.</S>
