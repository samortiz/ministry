Many pay close attention to God's salvation but neglect the kingdom, considering that the kingdom is a matter related only to the future
According to the natural and religious concept, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to obtain salvation
According to the New Testament, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to provide us with an entrance into the kingdom of God
In John 3 the Lord Jesus also said to Nicodemus, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
In Revelation 1:9 John writes, 'I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
In verse 5 He continues, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
To enter into the kingdom of God we need to be regenerated; apart from this, there is no way to enter into the kingdom of God
We have received the divine life, the life of God, through regeneration; therefore, to be regenerated is to enter the kingdom of God
Colossians 1:13 says that God 'delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
To enter into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God's eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ Jesus
Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory
God's purpose in granting to us precious and exceedingly great promises is that we may become partakers of His divine nature
As believers in Christ, we have the position, the ability, and the provision to become partakers of the divine nature
As we enjoy Gods nature His holy nature becomes our holiness and the nature of His virtues such as humility love and kindness becomes ours
Peter 1:5 says, 'For this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge'
When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues
Peter 1:6 continues, 'And in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness'
Self-control, or temperance, is the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits
In order to live a proper Christian life, we need endurance to bear with those around us and also with our environment and circumstances
The Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature
Such love needs to be developed in brotherly love to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love
Peter 1910 says For he in whom these things are not present is blind being shortsighted having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins
Brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble'
To be diligent is to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life
According to Peter's word in verses 5 through 11, to grow unto maturity is to develop what we have already received
As a result, we shall be full of Christ; that is, we shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Our corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity begins by our entering into the kingdom of God
Having received the divine life through regeneration, we can be in the divine realm and participate in the divine kingdom
We can enter into the eternal kingdom of our Lord because we have received from God's divine power all things related to life and godliness
We have also received the precious and exceedingly great promises for us to partake of and enjoy the nature of God
In our faith we need to develop virtue-all things that relate to the divine life, to godliness, and to partaking of the divine nature
In knowledge we need to develop self-control-the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits
In godliness we need to develop brotherly love-a brotherly affection, a love characterized by delight and pleasure
The result is that we will be richly and bountifully supplied an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
In this lesson we will see that because we have entered into the kingdom of God we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
In the New Testament the kingdom of the heavens a section of the kingdom of God is also called the kingdom of God in the other three Gospels
According to Matthew, there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter 13
We will now briefly look at these sections to see the living of the believers in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
If we would live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must live in the heavenly nature of the kingdom people
If we mourn according to God and His economy, we will be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens
In Matthew 5:6 the Lord said, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied'
We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens
If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us the very righteousness we seek, that we may be satisfied
To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows
For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, so that we may receive Christ
As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must walk in His divine life and according to His divine nature
Verse 10 says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
The Lord Jesus, in speaking of the believers' influence on the world, said that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world
Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house'
A city situated on the mountain has a general outward shining, but a lamp on a lampstand has a particular inward shining
Good works constitute the behavior and living of the believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
If we are such a shining light, God will be expressed in our shining, and all those around us will see glory, God expressed
As a city without and as a lamp within, we shine to express God, to let God have the glory in the eyes of others
As the children of our Father we must now fulfill this new law the higher law through the resurrection life the eternal life of the Father
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand
Man's flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men's praise
As children of the heavenly Father, we must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father's presence
To store up treasures in heaven is to give material things to the poor and to take care of the needy saints and the Lord's servants
Mammon stands in opposition to God, indicating that wealth, or riches, is the opponent of God, robbing God's people of their service to Him
As people who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we should not let mammon replace God in our living
In verse 33 the Lord Jesus said, 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you'
As those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we should deal more with ourselves than with others
For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you'
Living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we should always judge ourselves, not others
Matthew 7:3-5 says, 'Why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother's eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?
Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye'
In verse 13, destruction does not refer to the perishing of the person himself, but to the destruction of a person's deeds and works
In Matthew 7:14 life refers to the ever-blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God
We should not only walk on the way that leads to life but also receive the words of Christ as the foundation of our living and work
Our living and work must be founded on the word of Christ for the accomplishing of the will of the heavenly Father
If we do not receive the words of Christ as the foundation of our life and work, eventually all that we have done will be destroyed
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father
If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we will do the will of the Father who is in the heavens
We must be the salt of the earth to restrict the corruption of the earth and be the light of the world to enlighten the world
As children of our Father, we now need to fulfill this new law, the higher law, through the divine life, the eternal life of the Father
Whatever we do in secret for the Fathers kingdom whether it is giving alms praying or fasting the Father sees in secret and will repay us
As believers in Christ, we are living the kingdom life in the church life because the church is the kingdom of God in the present age
In one sense, the church is God's family, God's home ; in this home we enjoy grace and receive the life supply
Romans 14 speaks of receiving the believers; hence, according to the entire context, the kingdom is the church life
When the authority of the kingdom of God is operating within us righteousness peace and joy become the characteristics of our daily living
When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy before God
In the practical kingdom life in the church today, we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves
If our living is righteous toward ourselves and peaceful toward others, we will have joy toward God in the Holy Spirit
In Colossians 4:11 the apostle Paul told the saints in Colossae that his co-workers were fellow workers for the kingdom of God
Revelation 1:9 says, 'I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord Jesus said that His believers would suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom
For this reason Paul and Barnabas told the disciples, 'Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God'
The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life in His believers, forming a realm in which God rules through His life
The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is the realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ
When we abide in Christ, we partake of His endurance and acquire the endurance to bear suffering and opposition
If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake of the kingdom, we will inherit the kingdom of God
Unless we grow to maturity in the proper development of the divine life, we will have no way to inherit the kingdom
According to the Lord's word in Matthew, we must be absolutely righteous in order to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom is not only to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom for our enjoyment as a reward
Concerning the works of the flesh, in Galatians 5:21 Paul says, 'Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God'
The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
The believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God , and they are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
Presently all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom
Shortly before his martyrdom, Paul indicated that he firmly believed that the Lord would bring him into the heavenly kingdom
It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8 and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly race
When the Lord Jesus comes back, the indifferent and unfaithful believers will not receive the same reward as those who are faithful
The crown, a symbol of glory, is given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
The believers will be recompensed with such a reward, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness
Salvation was prepared according to the Lord's love and grace, whereas the reward is prepared according to His justice and righteousness
For this reason, the Lord cannot give, in His righteousness, the same kind of reward to both the faithful and the unfaithful
The reward is based on the believer's work after he is saved, whereas salvation is based on faith in the Lord and His redemptive work
Those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the judging Lord and who suffer the loss of reward will still be saved
Those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the Lord at His coming back will be saved, yet so as through fire
As those who are under the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we need to live in the reality of kingdom of the heavens
We need to live the kingdom life in the church life and to develop ourselves in the divine life until we reach maturity
The faithful and mature ones will receive a reward from the Lord, but the unfaithful will receive dispensational punishment
When the authority of the kingdom of God is operating within us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily living
As we have fellowship with Him and abide in Him, we partake of His endurance to endure persecution and opposition
If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake of the kingdom, we will inherit the kingdom of God
To inherit the kingdom of God is not the same as entering the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are living in the kingdom of God in the church life
The faithful and mature ones will receive a reward from the Lord, but the unfaithful will receive dispensational punishment
Through regeneration we have entered into the kingdom of God , and now we are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The individual Christian life is a personal matter, whereas the corporate Christian life is a matter of the church
Without the kingdom as the reality of the church, there would be no way for the church to be produced and built up
A believer who does not live in the reality of the kingdom can at most be a saved person he cannot be built into the structure of the church
When the New Testament gospel was first preached, people were told to repent for the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
The kingdom is a realm of life that allows life to move, work, rule, and govern so that life can accomplish its goal
In order to have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need Christ to be our life and life supply
The dispensing of God's holy nature does not take place once for all; rather, it occurs daily, hourly, and continuously without interruption
Jehovah caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took one of Adam's ribs and used the rib to build a woman
Adam's rib typifies Christ's indestructible eternal life, from which the church is built up to be the bride prepared for Christ
The corporate kingdom life and the church life are the spontaneous results of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us
Our corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity takes place through our living in the church life
If we would have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need to have Christ as our life and life supply
For the church to be the organic Body of Christ, the church must be constituted with Christ as life to the believers
The corporate life and the church life are the spontaneous results of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us
By entering into the kingdom and living in the church, we corporately experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God
Verse 19 speaks of the house, and verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
Timothy 3:15 says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth'
The house of God is a living composition of the many children of God who possess the Father's life and reality
Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality
The relationship between God the Father and the family of God is similar to that of the church as the Body of Christ
Christ is not separate from all the members of the Body, because, as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members
Truth refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God's New Testament economy
A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church
God's New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
According to these chapters, truth, or reality, is revealed as the truth of the Spirit, that is, the reality of the Spirit
The transition from the mystery of godliness to He implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
If through the reality of the kingdom we have the proper church life Gods manifestation that began in Christ will be continued in the church
It was not the universal church as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 1618 but only part of the universal church which is the Body of Christ
The record concerning the establishing of the church in its locality is consistent throughout the New Testament
Without the universal aspect, the church has no content; without the local aspect, the church has no expression and practice
If we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church, we will have the reality but not the practicality
On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality
Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province there were the seven cities spoken of in 1:11
In regard to the Epistles, only a few were written to individuals, and all the rest were written to the local churches
The church is in the advanced stage in the book of Revelation, because Revelation is written to local churches
In Revelation 1:11 we see that sending the book of Revelation to the seven churches equals sending it to seven cities
A local church should include the whole city in which the church is located it should not be larger or smaller than the boundary of the city
A Gentile or a tax collector is someone who does not have fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life
Chapter 16 relates to the universal building of the church, and chapter 18 relates to the local practice of the church
The more we realize how independent our natural self is, the more we are willing to be subject to the church and obey the church
If we do not submit to the church, we are finished with the kingdom, for the kingdom life is a life of submission to the church
The church must be certain that it has the presence of the Lord as its reality; otherwise, it has no genuine authority
When the whole church comes together in one place, that is both a meeting and the church, because the meeting is the church
The house of God is a living constitution of the many children of God who possess the Father's life and reality
Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and there is also God the Father with His life and reality
If we have the proper church life through the reality of the kingdom Gods manifestation that began in Christ will be continued in the church
If we would corporately experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity by being in the church, we need to meet with the church
The believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through their living in the church life
In the first local church, the church in Jerusalem , there were elders who took care of the administration of the church
In 1 Peter 5:2 Peter charges the elders concerning the matter of shepherding: 'Shepherd the flock of God among you'
The deacons and deaconesses are those who serve in a local church under the direction of the overseers, the elders
The overseers take care of the church, and the deacons and deaconesses serve the church by taking care of the many practical matters
For us to understand the services of the prophets and the teachers, we need to know the difference between prophesying and teaching
In the Scripture as a whole, especially in the New Testament, the word prophesy does not mainly mean to predict
Without the sufficient knowledge of God and the experience of Christ, we have nothing to speak on His behalf and cannot speak Him forth
In the sense of predicting, of speaking things before they happen, prophesying is miraculous and does not require growth in life
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation, and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction
Peter 4:10 says, 'Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
In the church we should all serve as good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering grace to one another
To corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, we need to function in the church meetings
Whenever we meet together, we need to have mutuality in our speaking, rather than only one or two persons speaking
Every saint should have the same right and opportunity to speak of Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ
We should not follow this traditional practice; instead, we should function in the church meetings in the way of mutuality
Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together, there should be the practice of mutuality
Paul does not say 'shall have' or 'should have'; he speaks in the present tense to emphasize the fact that each one of us has something
He then speaks of five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation
The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit
Based upon the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, the proper use of the tongue should be to speak concerning Christ and the church
In our meetings our unique purpose and goal must be to exhibit Christ and to enjoy Him for the building up of His Body
In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, 'He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men'
Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to others, it builds them up and encourages and consoles them
In verse 12 Paul continues, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
For the element of God to increase within us means that more of God Himself is mingled with us, is gained by us, and becomes our element
The more we love Christ, seek after Christ, and let Christ live in us, the more the measure of the stature of Christ increases within us
The planting and watering are carried out by the apostles, but only God, as the source of life, can cause the growth
Acts 2:45 tells us that the believers sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all according to need
For those who gathered an excess of manna, perhaps wanting to store it up for days and weeks to come, God caused the excess to be taken away
Through Christ in His overcoming life as our victory, we can overcome the usurping power of enticing and deceiving riches
We should not only obey the church in our locality and meet with the church; we should also serve in the church
In the church, all the believers should be good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering such grace to one another
These five items should focus on Christ as God's center for our portion and on the church as God's goal for our aim
In our human nature we have a tendency to love people; however, this kind of love is moral, natural, and even cultural
In contrast, real love is the result of enjoying the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
By means of this love, we spontaneously love others, especially those organically related to our Father who has begotten us
The Spirit keeps us in an organic union with the Triune God, who is love, and causes God to be our life and even our person
There is a great difference between this kind of love and the love that people have through trying to imitate the love of God
According to the New Testament, all mutual love among the believers is triangular; it includes love from three sides
Verse 35 says, 'So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts'
If we do not practice the way of repenting and forgiving, the longer we remain in the church life, the more offenses will accumulate
We should always be careful and watchful not to offend others, and at the same time, we should always be willing to forgive
The word you refers to the saints in a particular locality, and the word also indicates that the building is local
According to the context, the 'dwelling place of God' in verse 22 is local, whereas the 'holy temple' in verse 21 is universal
In verse 22 Paul says that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God
In these verses Paul carefully points out that it is in Christ that local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
The building is not in our mind, emotion, will, soul, or heart; rather, it is altogether a matter in our spirit
Paul continues in verse 12, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
These verses indicate that we should all be like Paul, who wholeheartedly cared for the building up of the church
The building up of the Body of Christ is accomplished indirectly through the gifted saints; therefore, they should learn to perfect others
In the seven epistles written to the seven churches in Revelation, the Lord charged the saints to be overcomers
In verse 11 the Lord said to the church in Smyrna, 'He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death'
As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ
In this epistle, to overcome is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism
If she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone
Revelation 1:4 speaks of 'the seven Spirits who are before His throne,' and 3:1 speaks of 'the seven Spirits of God'
The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5
Is the number for completion in Gods operation therefore the seven Spirits the sevenfold intensified Spirit are for Gods move on the earth
In essence and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned in the giving of grace and peace to the receivers
Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
The degradation of the church distracts God's people from eating Christ as food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge
If we are open to Him in our spirit as we read these epistles, the Spirit will immediately speak something of Christ into us
The man-child shepherding all the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as spoken of in 2:26-27
The last part of verse 4 provides an explanation: 'These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb'
The ultimate consummation of our living in the church will be our becoming the bride, the counterpart of Christ, at His coming back
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain a bride, the church, for Christ through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
As the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, they are being built in the church
Also, to be the overcomers the believers need to let Christ be wrought into them by listening to the speaking of the Spirit
For this reason, the overcomers not only need to mature in life, but they also need to be built together to become the bride of Christ
According to the order revealed in the New Testament, the kingdom comes first, then the church follows, and the result is the Body of Christ
Without any knowledge or understanding concerning the kingdom, it would have been difficult for the Lord Jesus to bring them into the church
Finally in 28:23 Paul 'expounded these matters, solemnly testifying of the kingdom of God' to those who came to him at his lodging
In this way the church becomes the organism of Christ, the Body of Christ, to express the Triune God embodied in Christ
If we are serious in following the Lord Jesus in this age for the sake of His interests on earth, we will enter into the kingdom of God
We not only need to know the truth and doctrine concerning the kingdom but also the reality and practice of the kingdom
Baptism ushers believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
Our baptism begins with our being brought into the Triune God, but it eventually leads us to the Body of Christ
Today we are not only in the Triune God, in Christ, and in the death of Christ, but we are in the Body of Christ-the church
The Body of Christ is our destination, and we should live, move, serve, worship, grow, act, work, and have our being in the Body
In 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul tells us that we were not only baptized in one Spirit into one Body, but we were also given to drink one Spirit
If we were not in the Body, there would not be the flow, and there would be nothing to drink; the flow is in the Body
Only when all the members are constituted with Christ, having His life and nature, can the church become the Body of Christ
If we look at our physical body we will realize that anything that does not have our life and nature is not and cannot be a part of our body
Since the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way for us to be constituted as His Body is to drink the Spirit
The more we drink of this one Spirit, the more the divine element becomes our constituent to make us the one Body
Just as the vine in John 15 is an organism, the church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God
The Body of Christ is the destination of the believers; therefore, the believers should live, move, serve, and worship in the Body
The reality of Christ is the Spirit; hence, the way to be constituted with Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit
The more the believers drink this one Spirit, the more the divine element will become their constituent and make them the one Body
The Amplified New Testament supplements the word blended with mingled,harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of the whole
The spiritual ones need to blend with those who are not so spiritual so that the spiritual ones can be properly spiritual
We should not expect every saint to be a spiritual giant; this is absolutely not according to the condition of the church
The hot ones need to be blended with the cold ones, the quick ones with the slow ones, and the spiritual ones with the not so spiritual ones
The Body is built up through all the different members-the comely and the less honorable, the strong and the weak
The different members should not be arranged into different categories; rather, all must be blended together in the Body
If we have not been blended into the Body, it will be impossible for us to be built together and for us to coordinate with others
In the church life there are people with different skin colors and of different races nationalities and social ranks however we are one Body
Because we have been organically united with Christ, we have been organically transferred into the Body of Christ
In the church life, presenting our bodies is a matter of sacrifice, of offering ourselves to God for His satisfaction
In chapter 12 the believers are encouraged to present themselves to God as a sacrifice, a living sacrifice filled with the Spirit of life
To practice the Body life we must first present our bodies to God and then we need to be transformed in our soul by the renewing of the mind
Transformation does not merely denote an outward change; it implies that a substance is changed both in nature and form
Transformation is Christ added into us and replacing our being, which causes Christ to increase and our natural life to decrease
When our mind is renewed, we are spontaneously renewed in our emotion and will, because the mind regulates the emotion and affects the will
In 12:2 Paul exhorts us to not be fashioned according to this age but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
If we are to live in the Body of Christ, we should not follow the present age or be fashioned according to this age
Through transformation by the renewing of the mind, we can prove and discern that the will of God is to obtain the Body
The Body is built up by means of all the different members, and these members are blended together to produce a blended Body
In the Body the believers need to have mutual care for one another and be members of the Body of Christ individually
In order to live and function in the Body, the believers must remain in an organic union with Christ in practicality
In this way, they will prove and discern the will of God, which is to obtain the Body so that they would live the Body life
For the sake of the Body life, our body needs to be presented, our soul transformed, and our mind metabolically changed
If we are serious about practicing the church life, we need to present our body, have our soul transformed, and be burning in our spirit
As a result, the teaching concerning the Body will be only a doctrine to us, and our speaking concerning the Body will be in vain
The more we enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our tripartite being, the more we will desire to be in the Body
The enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God makes us living members of the Body of Christ in practicality
Since the gifts in verses 6 through 8 are according to the grace given to us, these gifts issue from the grace of life
The development of the gifts in Romans 12, like the abilities of our body, depends upon the amount of life we have
In Romans 12 the gifts of grace in life include prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, and showing mercy
The first gift Paul speaks of in Romans 12 is prophecy, that is, to prophesy according to the proportion of faith
The main aspect of prophecy is to speak for that is to speak for someone and it is to speak forth that is to speak forth a certain matter
Based upon the speaking of revelation, we have teaching, and based on the prophecy and teaching, we have exhortation
There are some who are able to give material possessions to the church, to help the needy ones, and to care for the Lord's work
Finally, the believers live the Body life through living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love
Verse 9 says, 'Let love be without hypocrisy'; then verse 10 says, 'Love one another warmly in brotherly love'
In order to practice love toward others, we need the Holy Spirit to work in us and give us a certain amount of transformation in love
Verse 10 says Take the lead in showing honor one to another and verse 13 says Contribute to the needs of the saints pursue hospitality
Perseverance in prayer enables us not only to endure tribulation but to remain in the enjoyment of the Lord in His presence and in His will
In addition to all this, as God's holy people, we must 'abhor what is evil' , 'conquer evil with good' , and 'cling to what is good'
We, who have been separated to God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people
In relation to our persecutors and enemies, we must live a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love
While we are practicing the Body life in love with the highest virtues in the divine life, we should not avenge ourselves in any way
Verse 20 says If your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him a drink for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head
Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because others are not willing to have a life of peace
In the second half of verse 17 Paul gives a general word: 'Take forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men'
Since we are not only living before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men
If a believer desires to live the Body life in practicality, he needs to present his body and be renewed and transformed in his mind
Finally, the believers live in the Body of Christ through living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love
Such a living requires that the believers be transformed in life so that they may have the nature of God's love to love others
The believers corporately experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God through putting on the new man
From this initial aspect, Paul goes on to speak of being fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God
The church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, or even the Body of Christ
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, and as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
Although the new man has already been created, we still need to put off the old man and put on the new man, which was created in Christ
Ephesians 422 says Put off as regards your former manner of life the old man which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit
In Ephesians 4:22 the article the before the word deceit is emphatic and indicates that the word deceit is personified
To put off the old man is not merely to put off the old nature; it is to put off the old manner of life, the former manner of life
To put off the old man does not mean to merely put off the self of the old man but to also put off the worldly social relationships
Today the Lord desires not only to gather us together but that we would also put off the living of the old man
The spirit in Ephesians 4:23 is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit spreads into our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
The way to put on the new man is to allow our mingled spirit-the Spirit mingled with our spirit-to become the spirit of our mind
For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit guides, controls, directs, and possesses our mind
We need to see that the new man has been created and that it has been placed in our spirit through regeneration
At the time of our regeneration, the new man, created with Christ as the divine element, was placed in our spirit
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
Outwardly everything related to the new man is righteous, and inwardly everything related to the new man is holy
In the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, the new man was created
The new man was created according to the two aspects of Gods essence that is according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality
Colossians 3:10 says, 'The new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him'
Christ, as the image of God in Colossians 3:10, is the righteousness and holiness of the reality in Ephesians 4:24
In our experience the new man needs to be renewed unto full knowledge according to the image, the expression, of Him who created him
The more we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, the more the new man with the divine essence will spread from our spirit to our soul
The more the renewing takes place in our soul, the more we will have the image of Christ, and the more we will be able to express God
In the new man Christ is all the members and in all the members; thus, there is no room for race, religion, culture, or social rank
In the new man there are no natural persons; moreover, there is no possibility and no room for any natural person to exist
Christ will be all of us, that is, every member of the new man, because we all will live Christ and not ourselves
The ultimate and uttermost aspect of the church is that it is the new man for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose
Although the new man has already been created, the believers still need to put off the old man and put on the new man created in Christ
The believers need to first put off the old man with its corrupted living in the lusts of the deceit and then put on the new man
To put off the old man is not only to put off the old nature, but even more, it is to put off the former manner of life
In the new man, Christ is all the members and in all the members; there is no room for race, religion, culture, or social rank
Because of the work of Satan, the power of darkness, the earth with its atmosphere has become a world of darkness
We must realize that our warfare is not against human beings but against the evil angels, the spiritual powers, in the heavenlies
The warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between those who love the Lord in the church and the evil powers in the heavenlies
Verse 11 says, 'Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil'
Ephesians 6:13 says, 'Take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
By putting on the whole armor of God, we will 'be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
Truth refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God becoming our reality and experience in our living
Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience, signified by the breast
Regardless of how clear we feel our conscience is, it needs to be covered with the breastplate of righteousness
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith
Receiving the helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot at us by the evil one
The unique offensive weapon in our spiritual warfare against the enemy is the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God
The phrase by means of all prayer and petition at the beginning of verse 18 modifies the word receive in verse 17
Ephesians 6:18 goes on to speak of 'watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints'
We need to spend much time to pray for the saints in our locality and for the saints in other cities and countries
Paul asked the believers to pray for him so that utterance might be given to him to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel
Paul asked the saints to pray for him that utterance might be given to him for him to boldly speak the mystery of the gospel
The believers must strongly exercise their will to apply God's provision and put on the armor of God so that they may stand to the end
We also need to fight by praying in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition for all the saints and the apostle
