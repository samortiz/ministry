   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Taking the Lead in the Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders take the lead in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Timothy 5:17a Paul says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the elders should be able to take the lead in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that in everything they should go ahead of the flock to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To take the lead is not to rule but to set an example in doing things first that others may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders should always do things as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In taking the lead they are not rulers but patterns. c.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Teaching in the Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders also teach in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul says that an elder should be "apt to teach."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "apt" implies being able and accustomed to.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To teach here is similar to parents teaching their children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to teach the saints in the local churches the elders need to labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They need to get into the depths of the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the elders would be apt to teach, they need to be knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, an elder should be able to explain what the mystery of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a brother is not knowledgeable concerning the truth, he is disqualified from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An elder should be able to teach the saints like a parent helps a child with his homework.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this does not mean that every elder should be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not necessary for parents to be teachers in order to help their children with homework.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similarly, not all elders are teachers, but they all should be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul says that the elders who take the lead well should be counted worthy of double honor, "especially those who labor in word and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whereas all the elders should be apt to teach, not all have a special capacity in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among the elders in a local church, there may be some who have the burden to teach and to labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These teaching ones are especially worthy of double honor because nothing is more exhausting than teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 17 "word" denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and "teaching" denotes special instruction concerning particular things. d.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Shepherding the Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders also bear the burden of shepherding the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The local church is like a flock, and the elders are the shepherds to shepherd this flock, taking care of the situation of the flock and meeting the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Acts 20:28 Paul charges the elders of the church in Ephesus "to shepherd the church of God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over but to shepherd, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another verse that speaks of the elders' shepherding is 1 Peter 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Literally, the Greek word rendered "flock" is "little flock."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This refers to the church of God, which is small in number Luke 12:32 compared to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 1 Peter 5:2, the elders are not rulers but shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Shepherding is a proper care exercised over the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flock needs to be cared for, protected, led in the right direction, and brought to a place where they can eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 5:2 Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock; he charges them to shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The flock is not the elders' possession but God's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the elders should not consider the church in which they are taking the lead as belonging to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament we are told that the church is of Christ, of God, and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is called the church of Christ, the church of God, and the church of the saints Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 1:2; 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the church is not the church of the apostles or the church of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the church is composed of the saints, it is the church of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the church has been redeemed by Christ, it is the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the church has been regenerated by God, it is the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, Peter makes it clear that the elders should not think that, because they are taking the lead in the church, the church is theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders are to shepherd the flock of God, not their own flock.</S>
