   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE CHURCHES IN SECOND CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:1; 6:16; 8:1, 18-19, 23-24; 11:8, 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have pointed out, 2 Corinthians is an improvement over the first book in the experience of Christ, in the spirit, and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, the gifts spoken of in the first book are replaced by the ministry in the second book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see the churches in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OUR NEED TO IMPROVE BY KNOWING THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all must improve from knowing the church in a general way, or a so-called universal way, to knowing it in a local, specific, and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians do not know anything about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christians know something about the church, yet they know only about the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But there is a small number of Christians who not only know the church but also know the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The universal church is more or less something in doctrine, in teaching, and in theory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the churches are the practicality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christian teachers have spoken many messages and have written many expositions on the book of Ephesians regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of all the expositions that have been written regarding the church, the majority are on Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we move from Ephesians to 2 Corinthians, we move from the church to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are very few expositions on the book of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church, we may say, is the ABCs, while the churches are more advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some have said that 2 Corinthians shows us the sufferings of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is true, but they do not see the reason that Paul suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was suffering for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may have been taught about the church, but have you ever been taught about the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To know the churches is a great improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of us may know the church only in a doctrinal, general, weak, and even vague way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we do not know the churches in a practical, particular, and specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to go on from knowing the church in Ephesians to knowing the churches in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word churches, in the plural number, is used many times in the book of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Ephesians there is only the church in the singular number, not the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 1:1, the church is mentioned in the singular number, but that is the church which is at Corinth, not in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Besides this verse, all the references to the church in this book are in the plural number churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 1 of chapter eight refers to the churches in Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 18 of the same chapter mentions a brother who was praised in the gospel throughout all the churches, and verse 19 says that this brother was chosen by the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 23 we read of the messengers, or apostles, of the churches, and in verse 24 the Corinthians were exhorted to show before the churches the proof of their love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 11:8 Paul said that he robbed other churches, and in verse 28 that he bore anxiety for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had many burdens that pressed upon him daily, and they were the care for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 12:13 Paul asked the Corinthians if they were inferior to other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is all the time the churches, not the church.</S>
