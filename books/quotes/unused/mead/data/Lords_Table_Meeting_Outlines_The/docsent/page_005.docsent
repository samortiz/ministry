   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are two minor aspects of the Lord's table meeting: To display the Lord's death 1 Cor 11:26.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 11:26 says, "You declare show, display, proclaim, announce the Lord's death."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's supper is to display the death of the Lord, rather than to remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We remember the person of the Lord, but we announce, proclaim, His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We declare His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While we remember the Lord, the two elements, the bread body and cup blood , are displayed separately on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows that the blood is separated from the body, signifying death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With this display of death we proclaim and announce Christ's all-inclusive termination of twelve items on the cross the angelic life Col 1:20 , the human life Gal 2:20 , Satan Heb 2:14; John 12:31 , the kingdom of Satan Col 2:15; John 12:31 , sin 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3 , sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 , the world Gal 6:14; John 12:31 , death Heb 2:14 , flesh Gal 5:24 , the old man Rom 6:6 , self Gal 2:20 , and all things, or creation Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the death of the Lord all negative things have come to an end, and their end is displayed openly; this is the negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The table also shows we can receive the Lord, symbolized by the bread and wine, into ourselves; this is the positive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, the old creation is ended, but on the other hand, His new creation has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now He mingles Himself with us and we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To express our hope 1 Cor 11:26.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are to declare the Lord's death "until He comes."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We take the Lord's supper for the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are declaring a glorious matter, but we also have a glorious hope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a sense we are satisfied, but there is still a hope within us Col 1:27.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day He will return and change our body 1 Cor 15:51-54 ; we are waiting for this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Our body will be transfigured at His coming Phil 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2 Our redemption will be complete Rom 8:23.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words "until He comes" point to the coming kingdom Matt 26:29.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Matthew 26:29 the Lord told us that He would not drink of the fruit of the vine until He drinks it new with us in the kingdom of His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The coming kingdom is a matter of God's universal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two minor aspects of the Lord's supper point to the two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His first coming we have His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption the goal of His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His second coming will be after His having received the kingdom Dan 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-27 , at which time He will establish this kingdom to be God's universal administration the goal of His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The death of Christ in His first coming produced the church, and the church will bring in the kingdom with His second coming; to declare the Lord's death until He comes is equal to declaring the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church connects the Lord's death with His coming back; the church is a highway from one side to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church continues the Lord's death and brings in His coming back.</S>
