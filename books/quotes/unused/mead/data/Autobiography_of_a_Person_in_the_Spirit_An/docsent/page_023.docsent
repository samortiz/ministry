   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TASTERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tenth aspect of a person living in the spirit is that he is a taster of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are going to love the church, we have to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to be the tasters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we will have something of Christ to minister to the church which we love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2 Corinthians there is the aspect of loving the church and even more the aspect of tasting Christ, enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul received many visions and revelations; he tells us that he was "caught away to the third heaven" 12:2 and that he was "caught away into paradise" v. 4 . As a man living on earth, the apostle knew the things of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But men do not know the things either in the heavens or in paradise, the pleasant part of Hades Luke 23:43; 16:23, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the apostle was brought away to both of these unknown places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, he received visions and revelations of these hidden regions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason he mentions these two uttermost parts of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These visions and revelations, however, did not qualify Paul to be a lover of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not the visions and revelations that qualify us to be a lover of the church, but the experience, the tasting, the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he had received the visions and revelations, Paul said, "That I should not be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, that I should not be exceedingly lifted up" 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul asked the Lord three times to take away the thorn in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord would not take the thorn away, however, in order that Paul might taste or enjoy Him as grace and experience His power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's reply to Paul was, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was not a vision or a revelation but experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today what the Body of Christ needs is not a group of people who merely have the visions and the revelations, but who have the practical experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body needs those who enjoy Christ, who taste Christ, in a very experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is through this experience that we have something of Christ practically to minister to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelations and visions alone will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Apostle Paul had the visions, yet he had to be put "into the oven."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you say that you have the visions and the revelations, be prepared to be put into the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sufferings and trials are often in the Lord's ordination for us, that we may experience Christ as grace and power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord allows a thorn to come upon us so that we may experience the power of Christ in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the church needs a group of brothers and sisters who are under the pressure, the thorn, to experience Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to experience Him as the all-sufficient grace meeting our need in every kind of environment, and we need to taste Him, experiencing His power being perfected in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To magnify the sufficiency of the Lord's grace, our sufferings are required; to show forth the perfectness of the Lord's power, our weakness is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is through our experience of Christ as grace and power that we will have something real of Christ to minister to His Body, which we love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are lovers of the church, we have to be the tasters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, we will have nothing to minister to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we have to minister to the church is only the very Christ whom we have enjoyed, whom we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need the practical experience of Christ in the midst of our suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ministry is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross.</S>
