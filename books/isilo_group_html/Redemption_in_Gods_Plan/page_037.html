<h1 class="title">THE ISSUE OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:16; 4:19; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Cor. 15:51-55; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to gain a group of people to be the many brothers of His Son, the Firstborn, so that they may have the life and the image of His Son to express the glory of His Son in all things (Rom. 8:29-30). This is the goal and the ultimate purpose in both God&rsquo;s creation and His redemption. Although God&rsquo;s redemption deals with sin, sins, the old creation, and Satan, dealing with these things is not the purpose of His redemption. Rather, these necessary measures are part of the procedure for God to fulfill His purpose. For example, even though dealing with Satan is related to God&rsquo;s purpose, it fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose as it relates to negative matters; however, it is not the positive goal of God&rsquo;s redemption. God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose in its positive sense is to work His life into us to conform us to the image of His Son, that is, to make us exactly the same as His Son in life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE ISSUE OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is to be transformed into the image of the Son, Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). When we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, we receive forgiveness of sins, peace, and other blessings. However, these are secondary blessings; they are not the ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption. The ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to conform us to the image of His Son; hence, the ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is that we are transformed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption takes the life of God as the center, and it takes the image of Christ as the goal. The central significance of God&rsquo;s redemption is to appropriate the life of God, and the ultimate issue of our appropriation is to bear the image of the Son. Furthermore, when our living appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption, the life of God is the source of our living. Such a living issues in our being transformed into the image of Christ. The ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is that we are transformed fully into the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>When we believe and receive the Lord as our Savior, we begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, and God begins to reveal His Son in us. When we believe, God forgives our sins, justifies us, and bestows other blessings on us, but the central work of God in His salvation is to reveal His Son in us (Gal. 1:16). All the items in God&rsquo;s salvation, whether it is the forgiveness of sins, justification, regeneration, or renewing, are for the purpose of revealing His Son in us. God reveals His Son in us in order for us to be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In the process of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption, God works in us so that Christ would grow in us gradually. As we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption and live in the life of God, the Spirit of life will eliminate the things in us that are contrary to God&rsquo;s image, thus, giving more ground for the Son to grow in us. Then the Spirit can cause Christ to grow in us. If we are willing to remain in the position of consecration, allowing God to work in us continually through His Spirit and with His life, He will work in us so that His revealed Son is formed in us (4:19). Thus, we will bear the image of Christ.</p>
<p>After we begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption by faith and receive the Lord, the central purpose of all the work of God in us is for Christ to grow and be formed in us. This process requires our cooperation to allow Him to work in us freely. If we want to continue to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption beyond our initial salvation, we must hand over ourselves to God through consecration, allowing Him to work in us and on us as He pleases. With our consecration, He will remove little by little the things in us that do not match Christ, and He will work everything of Christ into our being until He is formed in us, and we bear His image in a full way.</p>
<p>In this process God will expose the things in us that do not match Christ and that hinder the growth of Christ in us. If we are faithful and remain in the position of consecration, allowing Him to work, He will remove these things one by one so that Christ will gain more ground to grow and be formed in us.</p>
<p>In our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s focus is on how much we allow Christ to grow and be formed in us. If we see this, we will not mistake improvement in our behavior, better control of our temper, or our good works as being spiritual progress. Spiritual progress is nothing else than the growth of Christ in us, the increase of His element in us. Nothing else should be considered to be spiritual progress. Only the growth of Christ in us, the increase of His element in us, is genuine spiritual progress. Therefore, we must allow God to work in us so that Christ can grow in us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
