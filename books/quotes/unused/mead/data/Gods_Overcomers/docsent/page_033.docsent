   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ADVANCE OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two great events occurred in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first was the Chinese Boxer Rebellion of 1900.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During this rebellion many Christians were martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second event was the great Welsh Revival of 1904.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During this revival many towns saw their whole population saved to such an extent that there were no more souls to save.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many phenomena of Pentecost were manifested among them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The leader of this revival was Evan Roberts, a twenty-two- year-old coal miner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had not received much education.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God called such a one from among the lowly and gave him a partner, Hastwell ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. After he was saved, Roberts often prayed earnestly in the coal mines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His only prayer was, Lord, bend the church to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those around him were both bewildered as well as impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Gradually, more people joined him in prayer, and soon the entire mine was affected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many miners rose up to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The revival began to spread to the entire region of southern England.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From them we have learned two truths: first, the revival work of the Holy Spirit is brought in through a group of people who are bent and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not need to ask God to send us an outward revival.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We only need to ask Him to subdue us in a deeper and fresher way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then life will spontaneously flow out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, from this time on, many began to understand the work of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before this time, although men talked about this subject, their knowledge of it was not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Roberts understood what spiritual warfare meant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The experience of Ephesians 6 was not thoroughly apprehended until his time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1908 while he was lying on his sickbed, he told of his experience of warfare with the evil spirits to Mr. and Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based on this understanding and the latter s personal experience, she wrote the book War on the Saints which helped many deceived believers become free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the past few years, almost all of the messages talked about among spiritual believers have been the teachings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are truths concerning spiritual warfare and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the same time that this revival was going on, another new work began in Los Angeles in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From 1908 to 1909, a number of black believers on Azusa Street experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning tongue-speaking, it is true that the practice among many is extreme and improper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, we do not nullify altogether the place of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should help others have this Pentecostal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul s teaching was, on the one hand, that not all speak in tongues 1 Cor 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, he told us, Do not forbid the speaking in tongues 14:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first verse is for those who overemphasize this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second verse is for those who overlook this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should take note of both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These individuals saw that the prophecy of Joel 2 was only partially fulfilled at the time of the apostles and that the day of the latter rain must come before the complete fulfillment occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spiritually speaking, the day of the latter rain refers to today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD S WORK TODAY AND</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE CUMULATIVE REVELATIONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the above discussion we can see the different discoveries of God s truths that took place before and during this century.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we need to ask: what is God s work in China today?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What kind of work is God doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately after I was saved, I heard many teachings from the foreign missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Prior to 1920 it was difficult in China even to hear a message on salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After 1920 many messages were preached concerning salvation, justification, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before that time, many people did not even know about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At present there are over one hundred and fifty different kinds of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God showed us the error of denominationalism and the mistake of sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason we began to preach these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later God began to show us one by one the different truths, that is, the truths that we mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Gradually, we began to see the victory of Christ, the resurrection life, the teaching of the cross, the work of the Holy Spirit, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everywhere in China men began to understand these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the course of our conversation with the Western missionaries, we discovered that many of these truths were also recovered in the same way in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know that God s truths are cumulative; later truths do not negate earlier ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the past truths of God form the foundation of the truths today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What we see today are the cumulative revelations of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When God opens our eyes to see this fact, we begin to realize that we are living in the tide of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This tide is a continuation of all the past works of God in previous ages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From 1926 on, we began to release many messages concerning salvation, the church, and the cross, and we testified much concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By 1927 we concentrated our attention on the subjective work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We saw that concerning the cross, there is not only the truth concerning Christ s death, but there is also the fact of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the past the resurrection which we preached was mainly a matter of faith; it was not related to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What we speak of today is resurrection as a principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not just a doctrine but a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is like a grain of wheat that dies and brings forth many grains; it is the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After this, God showed us what the Body of Christ is and where the reality of this Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We began to realize that as there is only one life of Christ, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Personally, I received much help from Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In England Mr. Austin-Sparks also received much help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brother Sparks was a pastor in a Baptist chapel in southeast London.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Later the Lord showed him different truths concerning the meaning of resurrection and the meaning of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot say that the aforementioned truths did not exist before today.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, they have not been revealed as clearly as today.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In spite of this, prior to 1928, we did not mention anything concerning the central matters of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>By February of 1928, we began to mention something concerning God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>From that time on, we began to tell people what God s eternal purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In that year, we had our first Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Afterward, we had a second Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All of the things mentioned in these conferences were matters related to God s central theme.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Despite the above revelations, it was not until 1934 that we realized that the centrality of everything related to God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christ is God s centrality and God s universality.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All of God s plan is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the truth that God is pleased to reveal to us in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is also the message we are preaching during this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is what God showed Brother Sparks also.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He saw much of the truth concerning God s overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God s overcomers are a group of people who take the lead to stand in the place of death on behalf of the whole congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Their relationship with the church is that of Zion s relationship with Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All of God s requirements fall upon Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When Zion is gained, Jerusalem is gained.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When both Zion and Jerusalem are secured, God s purpose is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our hearts are full of thanksgiving to God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>From all these brothers we have received much help.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As Paul said, Neither did I receive it from man Gal 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In the same way, we can say that although we have received help from our brothers, these revelations were not received from man.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We received help from Luther, Zinzendorf, the Moravian Brethren, and the Keswick messages.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today we believe that God s ultimate goal is to have Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>One elderly pastor, Dr. F. B. Meyer, also saw this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>However, by then he was already over ninety years old and could not do much work.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I believe that God has only one work today.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is the message of Colossians 1:18 which says that God desires to see Christ have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The basis of everything is the death, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Other than Christ, there is no spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is God s present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>SOUNDING OUT A CALL</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Hence, what are we doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We should answer as John the Baptist did that we are a voice in the wilderness John 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our work is to sound out the call to God s children to return to God s central purpose, to take Christ as the center of all things, and to take His death, resurrection, and ascension as the basis of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the message of Colossians 1 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We know the position of the church in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We realize that this position is lofty and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We thank God for the help rendered to us from the Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Yet God is showing us today that we should bring everything back to God s central purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Our work today is to return to the biblical ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>All of God s truth has the church as the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Paul was first put in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Later he was sent out from the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>All of the truths that we preach today have the church as the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This is our work and this is our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We should mention the miscellaneous truths less.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We should do everything we can to show people that the Lord is the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We are not here disrupting churches.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Rather, we are here returning to the initial work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We have to be careful about everything that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Everything that is of man we must learn to reject, and everything that is of God we must strive to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We thank God that we can touch God s grand purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We need to humble and prostrate ourselves and to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We need to be clear that our work today is not just to save some souls or to help others become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Our goal is indeed the greatest and the most glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Thank God that we can know God s present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>May God be gracious to us so that we do not become the castaways of the present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>May we be watchful, and may we not allow the flesh to come in or the self to gain any ground.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>May God s will be accomplished in us.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>FOUR RESPONSIBILITIES TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Finally, I would like to add a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We have four responsibilities today: 1 Concerning the sinners, we have to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>2 Concerning Satan, we have to realize there is a spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>3 Concerning the church, we have to hold fast what we see today.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>4 Concerning Christ, we should testify of the fact of His preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Today this testimony can be found in America, England, France, Spain, Africa, and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>However, the number is not great.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Outwardly speaking, their condition is also very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We should pray for these places.</S>
