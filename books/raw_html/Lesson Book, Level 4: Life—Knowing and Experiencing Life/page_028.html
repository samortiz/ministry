<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION</h2><p>[When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother’s womb—one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose. As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us. Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand. We become a prisoner of His love because His love has pierced our hearts. We become a sacrifice indeed, laid on the altar for God’s enjoyment and satisfaction. We will be those who have been thoroughly worked over by God and are then able to work for Him. Our future will truly be as a handful of ashes. All our ways of escape outside of God’s will shall have been cut off; God only will be our future and our way. At that time the experience of our consecration will indeed have become matured. May we all, by the grace of the Lord, pursue and go on together.]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is our consecration equal to? Why is it necessary?</li><li>What is the basis of consecration? What else is needed for us to consecrate ourselves to Him?</li><li>Use the burnt offering in the Old Testament to show the meaning of consecration.</li><li>Are you a voluntary offering? Do you mean it?</li><li>What must first take place before we can work for God?</li><li>Give two examples of New Testament persons that practiced consecration.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Experience of Life, pp. 27-47.</li></ol>
