How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins (25:1-13), and how to be faithful and prudent is revealed in the parable of the talents (vv. 14-30). In watchfulness we are virgins. This relates to what we are. But in faithfulness we are slaves. This relates to what we do.</p><p>Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins. As virgins they bear the Lord’s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>To be regenerated is to have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, that is, to have the oil in our lamp. But to have the Spirit in our soul means that we grow in life, are transformed, and have our soul saturated with the Holy Spirit of God. This is to have the oil in the vessel. Hence, Matthew uses the word buy in 25:9, indicating that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay the price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected.</p><p>The man in verse 14 signifies Christ, who was going abroad, that is, into the heavens, and delivered His possessions to His slaves. Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service (1 Cor. 7:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1; Rom. 1:1). The talents delivered to the slaves in verse 15 are the man’s possessions in verse 14. Today the Lord’s possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. If we do not care for these things, we will not have any talents. Therefore, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth, experience the truth concerning the church, and have a heart to care for the saints.</p><p>In the eyes of the Lord, it is evil to bury the talent and not to multiply it. The Lord does not care for our argument or excuses. He cares only that the one talent is multiplied into two, two talents are multiplied into four, and five talents are multiplied into ten. Furthermore, according to Matthew 24:45 the slave is to supply food to those in the household. Therefore, the result of our service has two aspects. The first aspect is that others are fed and given rich nourishment. The second aspect is that the Lord’s possessions are multiplied.</p><p>In the first two sections of the Lord’s prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord covered the Jews and the church. The third section covers the Lord’s word concerning the judgment of the nations in Matthew 25:31-46. The Lord will sit on the throne of His glory, the throne of David (Luke 1:32-33) in Jerusalem, and judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God’s dispensation. Those who obey that gospel and treat the suffering believers well during the great tribulation will be blessed and reckoned as righteous and will inherit the kingdom (Matt. 25:34), but those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
