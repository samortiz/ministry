<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Burning of Those<br>Who Join the Last Rebellion of Mankind</H2><P>The destruction of those who destroy the earth also includes the burning of those who join the last rebellion of mankind (Rev. 20:7-9). The last rebellion of mankind will be instigated by Satan, God's enemy, after the millennium. Fire will come down out of heaven and devour these rebellious ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Casting of Satan into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Then there will be the casting of Satan into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). Satan was bound and imprisoned in the abyss for one thousand years. Then after the one thousand years, he will be loosed out of his prison (Rev. 20:7) to deceive the nations to rebel against God. These rebellious ones will be judged, and Satan will then be cast into the lake of fire to join Antichrist and the false prophet, who were cast into it a thousand years earlier (Rev. 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Casting of the Unbelievers and<br>the Demons into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Finally, there is the casting of the unbelievers and the demons into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:12-15). God's judgment with all the plagues and calamities is used by Him to sweep, to clean, the dirtied universe. All the dirt, the unclean things, will go into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the "trash can" for the entire universe. After the unbelievers and demons are cast into the lake of fire, death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). Then the old heaven and old earth will pass away, and there will be a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVEN BOWLS&#151;THE THIRD WOE,<br>THE LAST SEVEN PLAGUES<br>TO FINISH THE FURY OF GOD,<br>AS THE MOST SEVERE JUDGMENT ON MEN</H2><P>The seven bowls are the third woe (Rev. 11:14), the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God (Rev. 15:1), as the most severe judgment on men (Rev. 15:7&#151;16:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Main Part of the Negative Contents<br>of the Seventh Trumpet</H2><P>The seven bowls are the main part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The First Four Bowls&#151;<br>the Most Severe Supernatural Calamities</H2><P>First, the supernatural calamities take place in the sixth seal. Then the intensified supernatural calamities take place in the first four trumpets. Finally, the most severe supernatural calamities will take place in the first four bowls (Rev. 16:2-9).</P>
