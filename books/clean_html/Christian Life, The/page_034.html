<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXII. ONENESS-KEEPING WITHIN THE BELIEVERS<br>FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit functions in oneness-keeping within the believers for the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3-4a). We need to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness of the Body. When we exercise to keep the oneness, the Spirit within us keeps the oneness.</P><P>Most, if not all, of the teachings in Christianity today do not touch this line of the all-inclusive Spirit with His functions. The teachings are mostly ethical and are concerning man's physical or psychological welfare. People teach that if a person is a good Christian, he will have peace within and without; he will be blessed to have a good marriage life and a good family life. This is according to the human, natural concept. It is difficult to find anyone teaching about Christ's making His home in our hearts.</P><P>Who in Christianity sees or speaks of the organic Body of Christ? The better teachers say that Christ died for our sins, so now we have to believe in Him. They say that because of His death on the cross, God forgives us of our sins, so one day we will go to heaven. They cover this but nothing further. But when we speak concerning Christ and the church revealed and typified in the Psalms, very few of those in Christianity would have any interest in this.</P><P>I am saying this to show us that in comparison with today's Christianity, we are on another planet, a "Christ planet." I have considered in the past that our rate of increase has been too low. As I was spending time with the Lord recently, He touched my understanding in this matter. We have to realize that the way we take in following the Lord cannot have a high rate of increase. The way we are taking is really a narrow way. The messages given in this ministry are altogether in another category, on another planet.</P><P>Other groups of Christians use natural and worldly ways to attract people. They use the ways of being social, of rock music, and of choirs with colorful robes. They use these ways to gain people, but we cannot use these ways. When people get saved and come into our meeting, they hear the pure word of God. We shared recently that the goal of Psalm 8 is to join the earth to the heavens and to bring down the heavens to the earth, making the earth and the heavens one. Someone hearing this may wonder what this has to do with his personal benefit and self-interest. But in our ministry we do not speak much concerning man's personal benefit. We speak and have spoken Christ in every message year after year. I am so thankful to the Lord that many of us in His recovery are still eager to hear the things concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God's economy for His heart's desire. I say again that this teaching is on another planet. Because of this, we cannot expect to have too high a rate in our increase.</P>
