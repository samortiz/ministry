<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIGNS OF CHANGING WATER INTO WINE AND THE RAISING UP OF THE DESTROYED TEMPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11, 18-22</h1><p>The Gospel of John is a deep book. We cannot exhaust the mysteries of the divine life revealed in this Gospel. Because the divine life is immeasurable, it is called eternal life. The word “eternal” refers to the elements of both time and space. Eternal life is unlimited, immeasurable; it has no limit and no ending in either time or space.<p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is a book of signs. These signs are related to the divine life. In foregoing messages we have been impressed with six major signs in chapter one: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. Every chapter in the Gospel of John is a chapter of signs. This is true even of the last chapter, chapter twenty-one.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SIGNS IN JOHN 2</h2><p>In this message we come to chapter two of John, where two important matters are recorded. The first is the changing of water into wine, and the second is the Lord’s word concerning the destroying of the temple and raising it up again in three days. Apparently, the Lord’s word concerning the temple has nothing to do with the incident of the changing of water into wine. Actually, these two matters are closely related.<p>After the Lord cleansed the temple (2:12-17), “the Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign will you show us, seeing that you do these things?” (v. 18). The Lord Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (v. 19). In purifying the temple the Lord Jesus displayed a very strong character. At that time He was not meek or gentle. Religious people would never expect that Jesus, the One with such a meek and humble heart, could do this. The religious leaders probably thought that the Lord had gone too far. In response to their word concerning a sign, the Lord said for them to destroy this temple and that He would raise it up in three days. According to John 2:20, the Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?” The Jews, of course, were thinking of the temple in Jerusalem, but the Lord “spoke of the temple of His body” (v. 21). The Lord was referring to the temple of His universal, mystical Body. Who is able to measure this temple? It is impossible for anyone to measure it.<p>The religious ones did not realize that the Lord Jesus was saying that His physical body, not the temple in Jerusalem, was the real temple. The Lord used that material building in Jerusalem as a sign to denote His physical body. The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus, but the body of Jesus was “destroyed” by the Jews when they had Him crucified. But on the third day, that destroyed body was raised up. Jesus said, “In three days I will raise it up.” The wording here is different from the record in the synoptic Gospels, which for the most part say that God will raise up the Lord Jesus. In John 2 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “You kill Me, and I will raise Myself up. Destroy this physical body, which is the real temple, and I will raise it up in three days. Once I raise up this temple, it will be enlarged.” This enlarged temple is Christ’s universal Body.<p>We are told clearly that the incident of the changing of water into wine was a sign: “This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee” (2:11). However, we are not told clearly that the matter of the raising up of the destroyed body is also a sign. But Matthew 12:38-40 indicates that the resurrection of Christ is also a sign. When some of the scribes and Pharisees said, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you,” the Lord replied, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.” Here we see that the Lord’s resurrection is the unique sign to this perverted generation. Therefore, in the second chapter of John we have two signs: the changing of water into wine and the resurrection of Christ. In this message we shall seek to get into the depths of these two signs.<p>John 20:30 and 31 say, “Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.” These verses indicate that John selected a certain number of signs and used them to compose his Gospel. John’s use of signs in writing his Gospel can be compared to our use of letters to make words and of words to write an article. Thus, the signs in this Gospel are the “letters” used to compose it. For example, two of the signs in John 1 concern the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God and Peter as a stone for God’s building. In chapter two John selected two incidents—the changing of water into wine and the Lord’s word concerning the temple in Jerusalem—and used them as signs in composing this chapter.
