   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MARK OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OPERATING IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mark of God s economy is this: God in three persons has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament deals more with the fact that God in the Spirit has come into us than with the fact of His coming upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The little word in referring to Christ being in us Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5; Col 1:27 , Christ living in us Gal 2:20 , Christ being formed in us 4:19 , Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 , Christ abiding in us and we in Him John 15:4 , etc. occurs many times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you have time, you can count how many times this little word is used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God made man purposely with three parts so that He could come into man and man would fit His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, man is a tripartite being body, soul, and spirit 1 Thes 5:23 corresponding to the tabernacle with its three parts the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only the innermost part, the Holy of Holies, was the place where God s shekinah glory dwelt and where the Ark as a type of Christ remained.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows clearly that God and Christ have come to dwell in our spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our spirit is our innermost part as the Holy of Holies within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can trace this from the Scriptures very clearly, especially in 2 Timothy 4:22, which says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also, according to Ephesians 4:6, God the Father is in us, according to 2 Corinthians 13:5, God the Son is in us, and according to Romans 8:11, God the Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God in the persons of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the mark of God s economy: the Triune God is in our spirit to be our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How regrettable that God s economy has been neglected in the past centuries by His children!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must recover this mark of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Using our spirit as His center, God works Himself out from our spirit into all our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God is in the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is most wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God came into the human nature, brought the human nature into the divine nature, and put an end to all negative things; now the Triune God and all that He has accomplished are in our spirit as our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From this central point the Triune God spreads out to saturate the inward parts of our being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The human spirit is the very spot of the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we miss this spot, we miss the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not say that this is the goal of God s economy; rather, I say that it is the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This mark has been neglected by most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may talk about many scriptural things and not hit this spot.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fact, we must realize that all the teachings of the sixty-six books of the Bible are for this mark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the different gifts and all the different functions are for this mark and must be centered on this mark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we realize the Triune God indwelling our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we experience the indwelling Spirit in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must realize that the Triune God is always operating within us Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is operating within us, not merely outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, He is operating within us even more than He is operating upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word translated operates is equivalent to the English word energizes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The indwelling God is energizing within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is also living within us through Christ, who lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, the Triune God is within us today as our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With this life there is also the inner law, the living law not the law of letters but the law of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This divine law of life is always regulating us from within Heb 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition to inwardly regulating us, the indwelling Triune God is anointing us within all the time 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us consider these four words further operating, living, regulating, and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much the church needs the inner revelation and experience of these four things!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not consider these things as teaching, but we should experience the Triune God every day operating in us, living in us, regulating us, and anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should allow this wonderful Triune God to continually regulate us in our thinking, in our motives, in our words, in our attitudes, and in our relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even our eating and our clothing should be regulated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must experience Him to such an extent and in such a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This must not degrade into a doctrine; doctrine does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we practice to experience the Triune God according to these four words, we will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that such a wonderful Christ is indwelling our spirit for the purpose of operating and living in us and regulating and anointing us.</S>
