   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Because believers do not allow the Lord to be Lord over their love, God's work is hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How many parents love their children so much that they hold back their children and cause God's kingdom to suffer loss!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many couples are so attached to each other that there is a shortage of labor for the plenteous harvest!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many believers are reluctant to part with their friends, so they remain behind while their brother fights alone at the front.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very pitiful that some believers think they can love their loved ones and the Lord at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not realize that if they love their loved ones, they cannot love the Lord; and if they love the Lord, they cannot love their loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we cannot say with Asaph, "Whom do I have in heaven but You?/And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth," then we are still living in our soul Psa 73:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot neglect the importance of the believer loving the Lord with all his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing satisfies the Lord's heart as much as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord does not look at how much we work for Him or how active we are for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It pleases Him when He sees us loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church in Ephesus labored for the Lord; nevertheless, they left their first love toward Him Rev 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Lord was not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is pleased only if we work out of our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have no heart for Christ, if we are not affectionate toward Him and do not love Him, even though we may accomplish a great deal for Him outwardly, what use is it?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should know that it is possible for us to labor for the Lord and not love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was the case of the Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we ask God to shine His light that we may see the reason for our activities and the intensity of our love towards Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the use if we keep saying, "Lord," and labor for Him all day, yet do not love Him in our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, may we have an absolute heart for our beloved Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's children do not realize what a hindrance their loved ones can be to the growth of their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a believer has other loves besides God, he will find out that God gradually becomes less important to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although his loved ones may also love God, he will perhaps love God for the sake of his loved ones more than for the sake of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His relationship with God is lowered from being spiritual to being fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We surely cannot love God for the sake of some persons, matters, or things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can only love God for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a believer loves God for the sake of his loved ones, his heart is directed by those whom he loves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God can gain his love only as a beneficiary of his loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If his loved ones can influence him to love God today, they can also influence him to lose his love for God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, when we incline our heart toward a certain person, it is very difficult for us to keep our heart calm.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we are under the influence of our emotions, trying ardently to please this person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this time, we probably have less of an interest in drawing near to God than we do of drawing near to the loved one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our interest in spiritual things, things relating to the intuition, will be greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps there is no outward change, but our heart lingers beside the one we love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this kind of condition, our interest in spiritual things, if not completely gone, is greatly diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will not be able to keep our heart from loving the vanities of the world because we can please our loved ones with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Worldly things, beauty, glory, and many other things unworthy of mention will gradually become the object of our seeking so that we might please our loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God and His requirements will then be forgotten and ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should realize that we can love only one person and serve one master.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we love man, we cannot love God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, any secret relationship that we may have with a person must be severed.</S>
