   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO KNOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT THE LORD, OUR SAVIOR, IS A LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THAT WE HAVE A SPIRIT, REGENERATED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians today do not know that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a regenerated spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the first meal we have to feed the new believers with is that our Savior today is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even about thirty years ago when I came to the United States, people told me that they had never heard that they had a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to help the new believers by showing them this truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HELPING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO REALIZE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THAT THE LORD AS THE SPIRIT LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IN THEIR SPIRIT AND THAT THEY SHOULD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ALWAYS EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT BY PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO CONTACT THE LORD, THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to help the new believers realize that the Lord as the Spirit lives in their spirit Rom 8:11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This should be ministered to the new believers immediately after they are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They also need to realize that they should always exercise their spirit by prayer to contact the Lord, the Spirit Eph 6:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even those of us who have been Christians for many years neglect the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are weak and low in our spiritual life because we do not continually exercise our spirit by prayer to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we pray we may subconsciously have the thought that the Lord is merely sitting on the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although this is true, we should also have the consciousness that we are praying to the One who is in us and who is one spirit with us 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of consciousness will change our prayer life.</S>
