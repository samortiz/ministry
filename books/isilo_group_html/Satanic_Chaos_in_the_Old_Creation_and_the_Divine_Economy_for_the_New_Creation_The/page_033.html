In this chapter we want to see a particular group of persons&#151;the overcomers. The Bible is a book concerning God with man. In between God and man there is a third party, Satan. Satan always makes trouble, and all the trouble is the chaos. The Lord needs a group of people, the overcomers, who will be one with Him to conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in His unique constructive economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
