Thank the Lord that he has rendered us much help in our fellowship. Now we have decided with him that we will have a few days of prayer first to see how the Lord leads. Perhaps the Lord will have work that He wants him to do. We especially ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai to remember the Lord's work in Chefoo in their prayers and to remember His faithful servant (especially his health).</P><P>We have already sent a letter to Brother Chang Chen Ming in Dairen and invited him to come to Chefoo with Brothers Chiang Ch'uan Ch'ing and Chang Wen Wei. We also sent a letter to Brother Wang Hsin Wen in Mou Ping inviting him to the meeting.</P><P>We ask the Lord to give grace to the brothers in Chefoo so that we can be revived.</P><P>Brother Chang Tze Chieh has also come to Chefoo to meet with us. We have also seen the importance of the work in Tsingtao, and we pray often for the work in East Tsingtao. Thank the Lord, Brother Chang has come. Perhaps the Lord will want him to go to Tsingtao. Please pray much for this matter. Because he has many friends in Tsingtao, it will be easier for him to work there. We will see how the Lord leads him after the meeting is over. It is very marvelous that the Lord does not want to bring him alone to Tsingtao. The Lord sent him to Chefoo first to fellowship with the brothers and then from there to Tsingtao (the flow of the work). Please pray for this matter. May the Lord revive His work. Amen.</P><P>From,<br>Lee P'ei Ling, Chao Pi Chen</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Witness:</P><P>I arrived safely in Chefoo eight days ago. Everything has been peacefully under the covering of the Father. Please do not worry!</P><P>Mr. T'ien P'ing Fang and Miss An from Ch'ang-ch'un and Brother Chang Tze Chieh and the rest from P'ing Tu have already arrived in Chefoo. I hear that Mr. T'ien Hsin Wu and Brother Chang Chen Ming from Dairen and the brothers from Tsingtao will be arriving soon. If the Lord is willing, we hope to have a few days of conference meetings beginning next Lord's Day. Please remember this conference before the throne of grace because if the Lord does not begin His good work first, we cannot do anything. We ask the Father God to not only save people in these few days of meetings but also to gain some for the Lord.</P><P>For the past few days, I have had four meetings with all the brothers and sisters in addition to talking to the brothers individually. In these four meetings, I really saw how lovable the brothers in Chefoo are.</P><P>Did Mr. Chang go to Hangchow? Have you received a letter from Brother Nee? How is your health? I am concerned about all these matters. If you have time, please let me know to comfort my heart. All the members of your family are healthy. Both Brothers Lee and Chao handle the responsibility for all aspects of the meeting well. My living quarters and food are very adequate also. Please do not worry about anything! I greet you with this. Peace in the Lord! The same to Brother Kuang Jung.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Luan Hung Pin<br>July 22</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 79</div><br></body></html>
