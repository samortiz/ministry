<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST GOD-MAN&rsquo;S LIVING<br />
FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 2:7-16; Matt. 2:1-23; Luke 2:21-24; Col. 2:11; Luke 2:25, 34-35, 40, 49, 52; 3:23; Isa. 53:2-3; 52:14; Heb. 4:15b; 2:18; Num. 4:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In His infancy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Lying in a manger&mdash;Luke 2:7-16.</li>
	<li>Fleeing from His opposers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From the land of Israel to Egypt&mdash;Matt. 2:1-15.</li>
		<li>From Egypt back to the land of Israel&mdash;Matt. 2:16-21.</li>
		<li>From Bethlehem to Galilee and settled in Nazareth&mdash;Matt. 2:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His youth:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Circumcised on the eighth day to put off His flesh and sanctified unto the Lord&mdash;Luke 2:21-24; Col. 2:11.</li>
	<li>Simeon, a man who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, prophesied to Mary His mother, &ldquo;Behold, this One is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in Israel and for a sign spoken against&mdash;and a sword will pierce through your own soul also&mdash;so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 2:25, 34-35.</li>
	<li>Growing to be strong, filled with wisdom (referring to His deity), and the grace of God (referring to God&rsquo;s grace in His humanity) being upon Him&mdash;Luke 2:40.</li>
	<li>At the age of twelve He said to His parents, &ldquo;I must be in the things of My Father,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I must be in My Father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (Luke 2:49). Early, at the age of twelve, the first God-man was in the things of His Father, that is, in the things concerning His Father&rsquo;s house, which is the church issuing in the Body of Christ, which will consummate the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
	<li>Advancing in wisdom (referring to His deity) and stature (referring to His humanity in stature and age) and in grace manifested in Him before God and men&mdash;Luke 2:52.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His silence between the age of twelve and the age of thirty (Luke 3:23):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Growing up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground (Isa. 53:2a), indicating that He was of a poor family.</li>
	<li>Having no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him (Isa. 53:2b), signifying that in both His status and stature He had no dignity of attraction nor desirable appearance.</li>
	<li>Being despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, respected by no man&mdash;Isa. 53:3.</li>
	<li>His appearance being marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men&mdash;Isa. 52:14.</li>
	<li>Tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin&mdash;Heb. 4:15b; 2:18.<br />
	All of the states and conditions mentioned above make people silent and inactive in social appearance.</li>
	<li>Although the Lord had a concern for God&rsquo;s house when He was at the age of twelve, God did not yet commission Him to carry out the ministry for the purpose to accomplish His eternal economy in taking care of God&rsquo;s house issuing in the Body of Christ, consummating the New Jerusalem.</li>
	<li>Many servants of God could not tolerate such a time of silence; rather, they failed such a test by God. The real ministry to take care of the house of God issuing in the Body of Christ needs the maturity of age (Num. 4:3).</li>
	</ol></li>
