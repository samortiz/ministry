   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Of Plants</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the plant life is for generating, for producing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the essential factor of the generating and producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His life is very productive, and He imparts His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to John 12:24, He was the unique grain of wheat which fell into the ground and died in order to produce us as the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is Christ as the producing, generating plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Linen, Signifying Christ s Conduct</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first expression of this generating life is linen, which signifies Christ s conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>a. Blue, Signifying Heavenly</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Exodus 25:4 speaks of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Linen in the color of blue signifies that Christ s generating life not only imparts life to us, but also produces a character and behavior which are heavenly, as signified by the color blue.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When others see us, they should have the sense that we are not earthly, but have instead a heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a heavenly appearance, the appearance of a blue sky.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Purple, Signifying Royal</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Linen with the color of purple signifies royalty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our behavior we should show forth a royal, or kingly, character.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the students in high school should be dignified and kingly in their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There should be a certain dignity and royalty in what they say and do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have a heavenly and royal character in our conduct does not come from our efforts to improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must turn from the religious, philosophical, and natural teachings concerning self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to experience Christ as our heavenliness, royalty, and dignity and grow until we become those who have the experience of blue and purple linen in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as a prince in a royal family is a person of dignity, we also should be dignified people, not by trying to improve ourselves, but by experiencing Christ and growing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need the experience of the blue and purple linen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Scarlet, Signifying Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the tabernacle there was also the need for scarlet colored linen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Scarlet signifies the blood of Christ shed for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should always bear the testimony that we realize we are sinful and need the cleansing of the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Often we need to turn to the Lord and say, Lord, cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if I am not conscious of any sin, I know that I am still unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, I am natural, so much in the old creation, and I am still fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How I need Your cleansing!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others may admire our heavenly appearance and royal character, but we should have the realization that we are sinful, always in need of the cleansing of the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to have the experience of scarlet linen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose the attitude of a young person toward his parents is that he is always right and that others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may say, Father, I have never offended you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I love everyone in the family, and I am always willing to do things for others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To have this kind of attitude is to be lacking the scarlet colored linen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anyone with such an attitude may be represented by black clothing, but certainly not scarlet clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others can testify that when I pray I ask for the Lord s cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though I may not feel defiled, I know that I am still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unconsciously I may still be in the natural life in many respects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because this is the condition of us all, we need the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need the Lord s cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fine, Signifying Even, Perfect, and Beautiful</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 4 indicates that the linen used for the tabernacle was not only blue, purple, and scarlet, but was also fine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be fine in our conduct and behavior means that we are balanced in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, when we laugh or cry we should be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not laugh or cry excessively or without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, there are some who laugh or weep without restraint, without any balance in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is also possible to love others too much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To love without the proper limitation is a sign that we are coarse in our love, that our love is not balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our conduct should not only be balanced, but also perfect and even beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A certain person may be very humble, but his humility may not be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need a beautiful humility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All our virtues and attributes should be like fine linen even, perfect, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more we consider through prayer and fellowship the significance of the fine linen in the color of blue, purple, and scarlet, the more we shall realize what a revelation is unfolded here and what experience is implied.</S>
