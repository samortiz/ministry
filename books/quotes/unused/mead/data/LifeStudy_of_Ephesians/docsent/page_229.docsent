   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-NINE FIVE ASPECTS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 5:25-27; 2:15-16; 1:20-23; 4:7-8, 11, 12; 3:17a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the embodiment of God and the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although all genuine Christians recognize that Christ is the Son of God, not many have an adequate realization that He is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To say that Christ is the embodiment of God means that in Christ is embodied all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In eternity past, God in Christ made a plan, selected us, and predestinated us, or marked us out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in Christ and through Christ God created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, Christ was incarnated, accomplished redemption through crucifixion, was buried, resurrected, and then ascended to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, He has descended as the Spirit upon His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now He is waiting for people to open to Him and call upon Him so that He may come into them, regenerate them, and make His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day, He will come back from the heavens by coming out from within His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He will be the King over all the earth, and His chosen people will be co-kings with Him in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For eternity, He will be the centrality of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible to exhaust all that God is and all that He has done and will do in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I heard about Jesus, but what I was told was far short of the revelation of Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of us can testify that, before coming into the Lord s recovery, we did not know Christ adequately as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, after we came into the church life, we began to realize that our Christ is the embodiment of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the embodiment of God, Christ is the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 3 says that the Spirit strengthens us into our inner man so that Christ can make His home in our hearts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . This indicates that the content of the church is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is not simply a group of people who have been saved out of hell, who are waiting to go to heaven, and who beg the Lord to give them peace, joy, and a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church in the Lord s recovery does not beg God for things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we in the local churches praise the Lord for all He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise Him that the church has the embodiment of God as her content!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How we thank the Lord for revealing this to us!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is the one new man with Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the person of the new man, Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you realize that the One you are to take as your person is the very embodiment of God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see this vision, we shall be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, what a Person we have within us!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is crucial for us all to see that the church is a vessel with the living Christ as its unique content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SEEING CHRIST IN A FULL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this message we shall consider five aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would see these five aspects clearly, we need to ask the Lord to blow away all the clouds that for centuries have kept Christians from seeing Christ in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In previous messages we have pointed out that Christ is unlimited, immeasurable, and unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the all-inclusive One that fills all in all 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is even the very dimensions of the universe: the breadth, and length, and height, and depth 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a Christ He is!</S>
