There is nothing as vital or as basic to our Christian life and to the church life as the real, practical enjoyment of Christ. This enjoyment is not Christ in doctrine or in knowledge, but Christ in life, in the Spirit, and in reality. He is a living Person for us to deal with.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST-THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>Colossians 1:12 says, &#8220;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&#8221; In the King James Version the word &#8220;portion&#8221; is translated as inheritance, but portion is the proper meaning of the Greek word. Christ Himself is the portion of the saints. God has given Christ to us as a gift (John 3:16), and this gift is our portion. After I had been a Christian for several years, I knew that Christ was my Savior (Acts 5:31), Lord (Acts 2:36), and life (Col. 3:4). However, I did not realize that Christ was the portion of the saints. Christ as the portion of the saints is not so simple or small. As our portion He is related to God, the creation, and the new creation. The new creation is the church as the Body of Christ. Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). God is invisible (John 1:18; 1 Tim. 1:14-17; 6:16), yet Christ is the image, the very expression, the explanation, and definition, of the invisible God. Without Him, we cannot know God or see God.<p>Christ is not only the image of the invisible God, but also the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). This means that He is the first item of all creation. As the Firstborn, He has the first place, the preeminence, in all of the creation. Verse 16 says, &#8220;Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&#8221; &#8220;In Him&#8221; means in the power of Christ&#8217;s Person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. All creation bears the characteristics of Christ&#8217;s intrinsic power. &#8220;Through Him&#8221; indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed. Finally, &#8220;unto Him&#8221; indicates that Christ is the end of all creation. All things were created for His possession. The entire creation now subsists together in Christ (v. 17) and it will be His inheritance.<p>The portion of the saints includes Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. Colossians 1:19 reads, &#8220;For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&#8221; The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). He is the very embodiment of God, thus, God is embodied within Him and expressed through Him. At this point, we must check with ourselves: How much do we daily enjoy Christ as such a portion? How much do we enjoy Him as a portion with God embodied in Him or as a portion with God expressed through Him? Do we enjoy Him to such an extent?<p>Christ as our portion is many other items in the book of Colossians such as the Head of the Body, the Firstborn from among the dead (1:18), and all in all in the new man (3:11). As the Firstborn from among the dead, He is the first one resurrected from among the dead. Thus, He is the first one in God&#8217;s new creation, in resurrection. He is not only the Head of the Body, but He is also everything within the new man. He is the life of the saints today and their hope of glory for the future (3:4). Colossians 3:3 also says that our life is hidden with Christ in God.<h2 class=head1>WALKING IN HIM-THE KEY TO EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>Colossians 2:6-7 says, &#8220;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&#8221; In this short sentence, there are two significant verbs: &#8220;received&#8221; and &#8220;walk.&#8221; As you have received Christ, walk in Him. The phrase &#8220;walk in Him&#8221; is not so simple. We walk, not with Him or according to Him, but in Him. To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. Although the words mentioned in these verses are simple, the thought conveyed reveals many mysteries which are difficult to understand. We may know these simple words, yet we must ask whether or not we have the experience revealed here. What does it mean in our experience to walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him? We need to be those who walk in Christ, live in Christ, and move in Christ.<h2 class=head1>KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE SPIRIT TO ENJOY CHRIST</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says that it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus. Moreover, Paul says that Christ was made wisdom to us from God including three important items in God&#8217;s salvation: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness refers to salvation including the regeneration of our spirit. This is something which transpired in the past. Sanctification refers to the transformation of the soul (Rom. 6:19, 22). This is something for the present. Redemption, which is something for the future, refers to the transfiguration of our body (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21). Thus, in the past we have had our spirit regenerated through the righteousness of God which is Christ Himself, we are presently in the process of the transformation of our soul, and in the future we will have our body transfigured.<p>All of these aspects of Christ must be realized by us in our experience. There is a real shortage of the practical enjoyment of Christ among the Lord&#8217;s children. We all must realize what Christ is today. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. He surely is our Savior, Lord, and Master. But we should also realize that if He were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not be subjective to us, realized by us, or enjoyed by us. Christ as the life-giving Spirit does not refer to who Christ is, but to what Christ is. He is the life-giving Spirit. If we are to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ in a practical and real way, we have to know and realize that Christ is such a Spirit. As the Spirit, He is waiting for us to contact Him.<p>On the one hand, 1 Corinthians says that God has made Christ wisdom to us: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:30). On the other hand, this same book tells us that Christ became a life-giving Spirit (15:45b). The practical way for us to enjoy this Christ is to realize that He is such a living Spirit waiting for us to contact Him. First Corinthians also tells us that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (6:17). He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our human spirit, and these two spirits have been mingled together as one spirit (John 3:6; 4:24; Rom. 8:16). We must contact Him by our spirit which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6). We have a regenerated human spirit with which to contact Christ as the life-giving Spirit.<p>We need to exercise our spirit (John 4:24) to contact, enjoy, and experience Christ day by day and at all times. Let me illustrate. Suppose as a brother, you have certain weaknesses, such as a bad temper or pride. How could you enjoy Christ to overcome these weaknesses? If you could lose your temper, this proves that you are out of Christ already. Because you are out of Christ, you have this problem. If you remain in Christ, the problem is over. In order to enjoy Christ as the victory over your weakness, you must keep yourself in Him. To pray that He would help you to overcome certain points is ineffectual. We must always watch and pray to keep ourselves in Christ by turning ourselves to the spirit. It is so simple. Turn yourself to the spirit, to your own spirit, your human spirit, in which the Holy Spirit dwells. If we would be normal Christians, we must keep ourselves all the time in the spirit. When you are in the spirit, you are one with Christ, one spirit with the Lord. In the New Testament, especially in the Epistles, we are told many times to do many things by the spirit, such as to walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25), to walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4), to pray in spirit (Eph. 6:18), to serve in spirit (Rom. 1:9; 12:11), and to be filled in spirit (Eph. 5:18). To keep ourselves in the spirit does not refer only to the Holy Spirit but also to our human spirit which has been mingled with the Holy Spirit to be one spirit. Our problem is that we are often out of this mingled spirit trying to do something apart from the Lord. Check your experience. When we are in spirit, we view things one way, and when we are out of the spirit, we view the same things differently. When we are in spirit, we have one understanding, but outside of the spirit we have another understanding.<h2 class=head1>WALKING IN HIM BY WALKING IN SPIRIT</h2><p>What does it mean to walk in Him (Col. 2:6)? It simply means to walk in the spirit. When you walk in the spirit, live in the spirit, do things in the spirit, move in the spirit, and have your being in the spirit, your whole life will be changed. There is no need to correct yourself or to improve your behavior. Just keep yourself in the spirit, and you will see the change in your life. There will be an automatic, unconscious change. Do not pay attention to your weakness. Forget about your weaknesses, circumstances, and surroundings and simply turn to the spirit.<p>Suppose a brother or sister needs rest, peace, or comfort in a certain way. How could he or she enjoy Christ as rest, peace, or comfort? Some would say, in a very natural way, that we have to trust in the Lord and pray that the Lord would comfort us and grant us His peace within. This is certainly not wrong. However, the secret to enjoying Christ is not in practicing this way; rather, it is in keeping yourself in the spirit. Learn to keep yourself in the spirit by watching and praying (Matt. 26:41; Col. 4:2; Eph. 6:18). When you watch and pray to keep yourself in the spirit, you will have the peace. Sometimes when you are in a difficult situation, you need peace and comfort. You may have tried to enjoy Christ as your peace, but you may have failed. The reason for this failure is that you were out of the spirit trying to enjoy Christ. The right way is to keep yourself in the spirit, to turn to the spirit; then you will have peace and rest. It is so simple.<p>Suppose I need guidance. Whenever I am out of the spirit, I just wander, not knowing where to go or the right way to take. The more I am in my mind considering, the more complicated I am. Likewise, the more I am in my mind thinking and considering which is the proper way to take, the more indecisive and hesitant I will be. But when I forget about the so-called proper guidance or the right way and simply watch and pray, keeping myself in the spirit, I become clear about the way I need to take.<p>The problem is that it is so easy for us to be outside of our spirit. When we are depressed or &#8220;out of it,&#8221; there is no need for us to get out of the spirit because we are out of the spirit already. If we consider our daily walk, day by day, from morning to evening, we will realize that we are often not in the spirit. If we would check our daily life, most of the time we are in our mind, not in our spirit. When we are in the mind, we do not have peace, we do not have the presence of Christ, and we are in darkness. But when we turn to our spirit, immediately we are clear about things, and we have the guidance, the peace, the patience, and the inner anointing. This experience is so simple, yet we make it so complicated. We would not turn to the spirit. Rather, we prefer to remain in our mind with our considerations, asking the Lord to help us in this matter and to do this or that thing for us.<p>We need to turn ourselves to the spirit all the time. This is the only way for us to enjoy Christ all the time. Perhaps you are about to quarrel with your wife or to say something to the brothers. Do not try to determine not to quarrel or to speak the best word. Turn yourself to the spirit. Spontaneously, you will know how to respond to your wife. You will also know the right way to talk to your children or to fellowship with the brothers. When we are in the spirit, we have a certain point of view; when we are in our mind, we have another point of view. We are the same persons with the same environment, yet how we are depends upon where we are-in the spirit or in the mind.<p>The practical way to enjoy Christ is to simply turn yourself to the spirit all the time, remaining there to contact the Lord. There is no need for you to ask Him to help you or to do something for you. Just contact Him, look to Him, and give Him thanks, praises, adoration, and worship. Forget about your problems, weak points, and surroundings. Simply remain in the spirit to contact Him, looking to Him, thanking Him, praising Him, adoring Him, and worshipping Him. You will see the difference.<p>Learn to do one thing-turn yourself to the spirit all the time. Remain in the spirit to contact the Lord. You will see how much He will be to you. He will be whatever you need, such as peace, guidance, and wisdom. Our problem is that we are out of the spirit most of the time. We must realize the deceit of the enemy and watch and pray to always keep ourselves in the spirit. If we would ask the Lord to help us in anything, we should ask Him day and night, &#8220;Lord, help me to keep myself in the spirit. Help me to remain in the spirit. Lord, keep me in the spirit.&#8221; The Lord is so rich and unlimited, yet we cannot enjoy Him outside of the spirit. There is only one place and only one way by which we can enjoy Him, that is, we have to turn to the spirit and remain in our spirit, contacting Him all the time. We must do this all the time from morning to evening, looking to the Lord that we might be kept in spirit.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REALITY OF BEING IN SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10; 8:1-2, 9-10; 10:6-8; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1><h2 class=head1>RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST AND SAVED IN HIS LIFE</h2><p>Romans 5:10 says, &#8220;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&#8221; In this verse two important things are mentioned: His death and His life. Through the fall of Adam we became enemies to God, but through the death of Christ we were reconciled to God. Now, having been reconciled, we shall be saved more and more by the life of Christ. The death of Christ was sufficient for us to be reconciled to God, and the life of Christ is good for us to be saved from many negative things.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN YOU-THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BOOK OF ROMANS</h2><p>Christ in you is the central point of the book of Romans. Romans 8:9-10 says, &#8220;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&#8221; The book of Romans tells us that Christ was put on the cross in order to accomplish redemption (3:24; 4:25), He was then resurrected from among the dead (4:25), and then He ascended to the heavens (8:34). Here in Romans 8:10 the Christ who was put on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is in us. Today Christ is in us. This is the central point of the whole book of Romans.<p>In addition, Romans 8:9-10 reveals three divine titles: the Spirit of God (v. 9), the Spirit of Christ (v. 9), and Christ Himself (v. 10). This simply means that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>FIRST CORINTHIANS AS THE ENTRANCE TO COLOSSIANS</h2><p>In order to understand the book of Colossians, 1 Corinthians and Colossians must be combined together. Without 1 Corinthians there is no entrance to the book of Colossians. There is the need to combine these books because both of them reveal that Christ Himself is our divine portion (1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 30; Col. 1:12). First Corinthians tells us that Christ, the portion allotted to us, is our wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:30). Righteousness is for our spirit to be regenerated, sanctification is for our soul to be transformed, and redemption is for our body to be transfigured. The day we received Christ as our Savior, He became our righteousness, we were justified through Him, and by this justification, our spirit was regenerated (Rom. 5:18). The regeneration of our spirit has been accomplished through the righteousness of God which is just Christ Himself (Rom. 3:22, 24). From the time we were regenerated until the present day, we have been in the process of sanctification, which is the transformation of the soul. Our spirit has been regenerated. Now our soul must be transformed. Ultimately, in the future when the Lord returns, our body will be redeemed. Our body will be transfigured, not only by Christ but with Christ. Christ is regeneration to our spirit, Christ is the transformation to our soul, and Christ is the transfiguration to our body. Christ has been allotted to us by God as our unsearchably rich portion.<p>If 1 Corinthians revealed only this much to us, we would still need a door, an entrance, in order to enter into and realize all of these wonderful things. Therefore, in 15:45 we are told that this Christ, who is the portion allotted to us by God, became a life-giving Spirit. This word concerning Christ being the life-giving Spirit is one of the most crucial truths in the entire New Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p>We must realize that Christ is not so simple. No one can exhaust telling us what Christ is because He is so much. The New Testament shows four main items concerning Christ: what He is, what He has accomplished, what He has obtained, and what He has attained. All of what Christ is, has accomplished, has obtained, and has attained has been concentrated into the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the very embodiment of these four main items of Christ.<p>As the life-giving Spirit Christ is everywhere. We may often have the human concept that formerly Christ was on the earth, and that now He is in the heavens sitting at the right hand of God (Rom. 8:34). This is true, yet we must also realize that this very Christ became the life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, He is everywhere today, and because we have received Him, He is also in us (Rom. 8:10). Although we cannot understand this in full, it is nevertheless a reality. He is beyond our concept and understanding!<p>When we preach the gospel of Christ, we must realize that at the very moment we are preaching, Christ is present. Therefore, in Romans 10:6-8 the unbelievers do not need to go to the heavens to bring Christ down or to Hades to bring Christ up (vv. 6-7). Christ as the living Word is near them, in their mouth and in their heart, waiting for them to receive Him. If they would just open their mouths and say from their heart, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I believe in You,&#8221; Christ would enter into them.<p>The Christ we believe in is a real, living Person, who is the life-giving Spirit; He is not a system of religion or a set of teachings. Since we have received Him and believed into Him, this wonderful all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now indwelling us, mingling with us to be one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). Being one spirit with the Lord is the key for us to enjoy Christ. All of what Christ is, has accomplished, obtained, and attained is concentrated into this one life-giving Spirit. Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our spirit and mingled Himself with our spirit. Now we are joined to Him. He is such a life-giving Spirit, we have a regenerated spirit, and these two spirits are mingled as one.<h2 class=head1>LIVING IN THE SPIRIT VERSUS IMPROVING OUR BEHAVIOR</h2><p>A big mistake made by many in Christianity today is to merely teach people how to improve their behavior or to adjust and correct their conduct. This, however, is not the Bible&#8217;s revelation. Before we were regenerated, we lived, walked, and had our being in the soul. When we were regenerated, we received another life into our spirit (John 1:12-13; 3:6; Rom. 8:10). To be regenerated simply means to receive another life. This life is Christ Himself. Now that we have received the divine life, we need to be saved in this life daily (Rom. 5:10). To be saved does not mean to improve our conduct or adjust our behavior; rather, it means that we must deny our soul. We must give up living in the soul. We must turn absolutely from the soul to the spirit. We must forget about correction or improvement and turn to the spirit. The Christian life is not a matter of loving versus hating or of good versus bad; it is a matter of living in the spirit versus living in the soul.<h2 class=head1>TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR WALK</h2><p>Romans 8:1-2 and 4 say, &#8220;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death....that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8221; In the King James Version, the article the is inserted before the word spirit at the end of verse 4. However, in the Greek text, the article the is not there. Because of this, many versions prefer not to capitalize the word spirit. It is difficult to discern the word spirit used in this chapter and in other places in the New Testament, unless it is clearly designated to denote God&#8217;s Holy Spirit or our human spirit, as in Romans 8:9 and 16. According to its usage in the New Testament, the word spirit in this verse means our human spirit mingled with God&#8217;s Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:16). We may also say that Romans 8:4 refers mainly to our own spirit, our human spirit. This is quite logical, since the contrast in verse 4 is between the flesh and the spirit, our human spirit. This contrast is not between the Holy Spirit and the flesh, but between our spirit and the flesh.<p>We as men have three parts: a body, soul, and spirit. Our body was corrupted through the fall of man to become the flesh (Gen. 6:3; Rom. 7:18). Deeper than our body is our soul and spirit. Our soul was also corrupted and became the self (Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25). Therefore, between our spirit and our flesh is our self. Our self is just our very being. Now, there are two possibilities for our walk. We can walk according to spirit or according to flesh.<h2 class=head1>TO WALK IN CHRIST BEING TO WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>To live, walk, and have our being in Christ is simply to walk according to spirit. How do we know that we are in Christ? According to Romans 8, to be in Christ is to walk according to spirit (v. 4). To walk according to spirit means to have no condemnation in Christ Jesus (v. 1). Although many brothers say that they are in Christ, they also testify that they have a lot of condemnation within. The reason for this condemnation is that they are walking in the soul according to flesh and not walking in the spirit, according to spirit.<p>When you are walking in the spirit, there is no condemnation. To say that there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus (v. 1) is equal to walking according to spirit (v. 4). When we are walking in spirit in reality, it is at that moment that we experience no condemnation. However, if we are out of the spirit, there is condemnation all of the time.<p>The Normal Christian Life by Brother Watchman Nee has helped many brothers and sisters by opening up chapters five through eight of the book of Romans. However, my burden is that those who were helped by this book would walk in the spirit. How many brothers and sisters walk in the spirit? Christ is the victory; He is the life through which we are being saved from many negative things (Rom. 5:10). Yet how much do we enjoy Christ day by day? How much did we enjoy such a living salvation from so many negative things today? We have the doctrine and teaching about Romans 5-8, but how much enjoyment of what is taught about Christ in these chapters do we have? We may have the teaching, but we may not have the enjoyment of the teaching. In order to help us enter into the enjoyment of the teaching found in Romans, I will not give any more definitions in this chapter. Rather, I will give some experiences and illustrations.<h2 class=head1>OVERCOMING SINS BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>When I was a young Christian, I was taught by others&#8217; writings and through sermons on Romans 6-8 to overcome sins. Someone would speak about victory over sin or the release from sin. When I heard this, I would pray much saying, &#8220;O Lord, I do long to have the victory over all sins. How much I desire to be released from all of the sinful things!&#8221; I prayed, but the more I prayed, the more failures I had. The more I prayed for victory over sin, the more I was defeated by sin. For many years I did not know the reason for this experience. Eventually, I began to understand that my shortcoming was that I was asking the Lord to do something for me while I was a person still living in my soul, not in my spirit. I began to realize that there was no need for me to pray for victory over sin or for the release from sin. I simply needed to practice to turn to the spirit, forgetting about victory over sin and the release from sin.<p>I realized that I must turn to the mingled spirit, staying in the spirit to contact the Lord. I practiced to keep my mind away from sin or the victory over sin, and to set my mind upon Christ in my spirit (Rom. 8:6). In the realm of the mingled spirit, there is no need to strive for victory over sin. We need to learn one thing-not to overcome sin but to walk in the spirit. I found out that whenever I was out of the spirit, immediately I was in another realm. In that realm there was the need to strive for the victory over sin.<h2 class=head1>TWO DIFFERENT REALMS-THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL</h2><p>The spirit and the soul are two different realms, kingdoms, or worlds. In the realm of the spirit there is no need to strive for the victory over sin. In the New Jerusalem, we will not worry about victory over sin. To be in spirit today is a foretaste of the New Jerusalem. Whatever the New Jerusalem will be in the future can be realized today as a foretaste in our spirit. In contrast, when we are living in the soul, we are in another kingdom or realm. In the realm of the soul, there is the need for the victory over sin. If we read Romans 5-8 carefully, we will realize that the real release from sin is the release from the soul. The release from sin is the release from &#8220;me,&#8221; &#8220;myself,&#8221; and &#8220;I,&#8221; which are just the soul. As long as we are out of the self, and in the spirit, everything is wonderful!<p>Suppose you are a mother and you are about to say an angry word to your children. Before saying such a word, turn yourself to the spirit, the mingled spirit. If you will do this, immediately you may sense that there is no need to say such a word to your children. Your thought, sense, understanding, and idea will be completely changed. To illustrate again, suppose as a mother you have the intention to rebuke a difficult child. If you turn yourself to the spirit before you do this, immediately you will sense a change. Something within may show you that there is no need to rebuke the child in your former manner. You may say something different to the child. Again perhaps, as a wife at home during the daytime while your husband is away at work, you may have the thought that when your husband comes home, you will make a certain deal with him concerning a certain matter. Before doing this, turn to your spirit. Immediately there will be a change in your feeling and thought concerning the entire situation! Therefore, before doing anything, going anywhere, or seeing anything, we must turn to our spirit. Then we will see a change.<p>As fallen men, we have Satan in our flesh (Rom. 7:17, 20) and our soul is just the self (Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25). Since we have received Christ, He is dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Thus, Satan is in our flesh, the self is our soul, and the dear Lord, the all-inclusive Christ, is in our spirit. Whenever we turn ourselves to the spirit, immediately we meet Christ. When we are in our soul, there is a certain kind of understanding, idea, realization, and concept. However, when we turn to our spirit, there will be another kind of understanding, which is the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). This is because in the spirit, we meet with Christ. This is why it is so easy for Christians to have a change. As Christians we are changeable people. As a genuine disciple of Christ, you will be changeable all of the time. In the morning, you may be upset with a certain brother, but after a few minutes, you really love that brother. There was a change in your feeling, a change in your temperament. The reason for this change is that you turned to your spirit. In Romans 7, the words me, myself, and I are mentioned again and again, more than thirty times. But in Romans 8, the Spirit is mentioned again and again. In chapter seven there is a person seeking to do good for God in the soul (vv. 21-23). In chapter eight this person is transferred from the soul to the spirit to walk in the spirit (vv. 9, 4, 6, 10).<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING THE LORD BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We should learn to practice to be in spirit all of the time. If we would learn to do this one thing and practice it all the time, we will see a change, a difference, in our daily life. We will realize salvation from so many mistakes, errors, wrong doings, and troubles. We will be kept from many negative things, and we will enjoy the Lord all of the time. The best prayer I have is not to ask the Lord to do things for me, but to just stay in the spirit contacting the Lord all the time. The best prayer is to stay in the spirit contacting Him.<p>There is no other way but to turn yourself to the spirit all of the time and day by day. Turn yourself to the spirit regardless of where you are, what you are doing, or what kind of situation you are in. Forget about all the things surrounding you and pay attention to one thing: turn to the spirit.<p>There is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. This means that there is no condemnation to those who walk according to spirit, who walk in spirit. We are in Christ practically when we are walking in the spirit. If you turn to the spirit, you have peace, light, the inner anointing, and whatever you desire to enjoy of Christ. There is no need to learn many other things until you learn this one thing-to turn yourself to the spirit and remain there to contact the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICAL ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>The practical way to enjoy Christ is to turn to the spirit all of the time. In the morning, evening, and throughout the day, learn to turn to your spirit. Learn to turn to your spirit not only in the time of prayer, but also before saying anything, before going any place, and before doing anything. Then there will be a change in your understanding, you will enjoy Christ, and you will be in Christ in a practical way.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>SIX MAJOR ITEMS OF ENJOYMENT IN THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 6:35; 4:14; 7:37; 20:22; 15:4-5; 8:12; 10:10; 3:6; 4:24; 6:57, 63; 14:16-17, 19-20</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE, FOOD, WATER, BREATH, LIGHT, AND ABODE</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, there are six major items of the enjoyment of Christ in the spirit. These include life (John 1:4; 10:10) which is the first and most basic matter; the food supply (6:35); the living water for drinking (4:14; 7:37); the breath of life (20:22); the light of life (8:12); and the dwelling place (15:4-5). As human beings living on this earth, we all need life, food, water, air, light, and a dwelling place. In order for life to exist, food, water, air, and light are needed. These four items are for the maintenance of life. Without sunlight in the universe, all the living things would die. Light is needed to maintain life. Similarly, man cannot live without air for a long period of time, perhaps less than three or four minutes. If we do not breathe air, we will die within a short period of time. We also must eat and drink in order to sustain our life.<p>In the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, the Lord Jesus said that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10). In order to maintain this life given by the Lord Jesus, light, air, food, and water are needed. Yet even with all of these items, there is still the need of a dwelling place (15:4-5). This dwelling place is the Lord Jesus Himself. Not only is He our life, light, air, food, and water, but also He is our abode (14:23). Each of these items is definitely and clearly mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John. While other things are mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John, none are as vital or as basic as these six items. In chapter ten, the Lord Jesus told us that He is the good Shepherd (vv. 11, 14), the door (vv. 7, 9), and the pasture (v. 9). But as far as the matter of life is concerned, the Lord as the Shepherd is not as vital as these six items. Christ being our life, food, water, breath, light, and abode shows us how vital He is to us.<p>Many Christians may have the knowledge, the doctrine, and the teaching that Christ is their life, their spiritual food, their living water, their fresh air, their light, and their abode. However, many do not know the proper way, the practical way, to enjoy Christ as their food to eat, their living water to drink, their fresh air to breathe, their light to walk in, and their abode, or dwelling place, in which to abide. The practical way to enjoy Christ as all these items is in our mingled spirit, which is our human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17). If we read the Gospel of John carefully, we will discover that after the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption through His work on the cross and passed through death into resurrection, He became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit (20:22; 1 Cor. 15:45b). As the Spirit, the Lord Himself dwells in our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22).<p>In the Gospel of John, Christ is first revealed as the Word in the beginning (1:1). As the eternal Word He is God Himself. Then He became flesh (1:14) through incarnation in order to accomplish redemption on the cross (1:29; 11:49-51; 19:34). After the accomplishment of redemption, He passed through death and entered into resurrection (19:30; 20:9). On the day of resurrection, He returned to the disciples, breathing into them and saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (20:22). After the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, it is difficult to trace where He went. Actually, the Lord entered into the disciples, so wherever they went, the Lord was with them. When the disciples were meeting in a room, He was in the room with them. When Peter and the disciples went to the sea, He was also at the sea. Where the disciples were, He was because He had become the life-giving Spirit, and as the Spirit He had breathed Himself into them. Thus, in a sense, the Gospel of John does not have a conclusion. Today there may be hundreds of chapters as a continuation of this Gospel because Jesus is still here within us as the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE LINE OF THE SPIRIT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, there is the line of life, and there is also the line of the spirit. The line of the spirit begins in John 3:6 where the Lord says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; This line continues in John 4:24, &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&#8221; In these verses we can see both the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Our human spirit has been born of the divine Spirit, and we must worship God, who is Spirit, in our human spirit. If we are to worship God, we must worship Him in our spirit. This means that if we are to deal with God, contact God, enjoy God, and partake of God, we must contact Him in our spirit, exercising our spirit. God is Spirit, and this God includes Christ as our life, our food, our water, our air, our light, and our abode. He is everything!<p>John 6:63 as a continuation of the line of the spirit says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; It is the Spirit who gives life. It is the Spirit who nourishes. If you are in your spirit enjoying the life-giving Spirit, He will nourish you as food. This Spirit will also be the living water flowing out from your innermost being (7:38-39). The Spirit will be a source of life within you, in your spirit, your innermost being.<p>In chapter fourteen of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus reveals that He must be transfigured into the Spirit in order that He may dwell within us and be one with us (vv. 17-18). If He had not been transfigured into the Spirit, there would be no possibility for us to abide in Him or for Him to abide in us (15:4-5). In order to come into us, He had to be transfigured from the flesh to the Spirit through death and resurrection.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO ENJOY CHRIST AS LIGHT</h2><p>The secret of taking Christ as our food, water, air, light, and abode is to turn to our spirit. To illustrate, let us consider the matter of light. In order to maintain life, the first item is light. Without physical light in the universe, all the living creatures on this earth would be in darkness. We must realize that whenever we are not in spirit, we are just in darkness. Regardless of how much knowledge we have, or how much we read the Scriptures, as long as we are out of the spirit, we are in darkness. The place of light is in our human spirit (Prov. 20:27), regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit. In our soul is darkness, and in our flesh, our body, is sin (Rom. 7:17-18). Outside of the spirit, we are either in darkness or in sin. If we are in our soul trying to seek the guidance of the Lord, regardless of how much energy or effort we exercise, we will still be in darkness. On the other hand, if we turn to the spirit and remain there, immediately we will sense the light, and everything will be clear and transparent. One minute everything can be transparent, and the next minute everything can be in darkness. In the morning we can be so clear, and later in the day we can be in darkness. The reason for this is that perhaps in the morning while we were praying, we prayed ourselves into the spirit. But after the prayer, we came out of the spirit. If we just turn back to the spirit again, the sky will be clear, and everything will be transparent. However, if we turn to the mind to analyze or consider, we will again be in darkness. To be clever in our understanding does not help. Whenever we have a problem, the best way to handle it is to turn back to the spirit. If we turn to the spirit, everything will be so clear. To be in the light is easy. Our problem is that we do not practice to be in the light by turning to our spirit.<p>Most of the time when we have problems, we exercise the mind to solve them or we go to other people to help us solve them. The more people that we go to with our problems, the more complicated we become. The best way is to simply turn quietly to the spirit. This is so easy that even a new believer can practice it. We must learn to practice this reality. Christ, the living Lord, is so real; He is the dynamic center of the Christian life because He is the life-giving Spirit. Whenever we turn back to our spirit, we meet Him.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO BREATHE CHRIST AS THE FRESH AIR</h2><p>The first item to maintain life is light. The second item to maintain life is air or breathing. The more we remain in the soul, the more we will be choked, the more we will sense the shortage of air. On the other hand, when we turn ourself to the spirit, right away we sense the freshness of air. Through my experiences, I have learned one vital lesson: to turn to the spirit. We all must learn not to take care of so many outward things, but we must learn to turn to the spirit all the time. We need to forget about our environment. Whenever we are in spirit, we often have the sense that we are not on earth. Everything is so fresh and new in our spirit. This freshness and newness is Christ as our air. We Christians think, consider, and worry too much. Many times we will not turn to the spirit until we are forced to. If our business runs well, we do not turn to the Lord. Therefore, we often need troubles, trials, and painful sufferings, things we cannot get through, to force us to give up and turn back to the Lord. We must learn to be willing to turn to our spirit. Even if we could get through in some area outside of the spirit, we should still come back to the spirit. When we turn to our spirit, we sense the fresh air within us; we are refreshed, strengthened, and uplifted.<p>When we read the Bible, it is a good practice to read a little bit, maybe half a verse, and then say a little word to the Lord. Usually, however, our habit is just to read. When we merely read, we are often occupied in the mentality. We should not only use our mind, but also exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. We may read half of John 1:1, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word....&#8221; Then we could tell the Lord, &#8220;O Lord, praise You. You are the Word. In the beginning, You were there.&#8221; The best way to read the Bible is not merely to read, solely exercising our mind, but to read a little and then say something to the Lord. We need to learn when reading to exercise our spirit by praying and not to exercise our mind too much. To pray is the best way to exercise our spirit. In the morning while we are dressing or washing, we can say something to the Lord from our spirit. We must learn at all times to turn ourselves to the Lord.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO ENJOY CHRIST AS THE LIVING WATER</h2><p>The third item for the maintenance of life is the experience of Christ as our living water. Physically, we can live without eating longer than we can live without drinking. Thus, following light and air, we need water. If we keep ourselves in the spirit, we will sense that we are being watered. Many times we are dry within because we are in the soul. If we would turn to the spirit, we would sense water instead of dryness. In our spirit is the living water ready to water us all the time. When we pray, we need to follow the inner flow of life to utter something to the Lord. If the inner feeling or sense causes us to repent, we should say something according to the inner sense of life, and not according to mere knowledge. Perhaps you would say, &#8220;Lord, I am sinful.&#8221; To say something according to this inner sense is to follow the flow. That flow is the springing up of the living water within us (John 4:14; 7:38). When the living water springs up and flows out of us, the first one to be watered is us. We are watered, and then we will water others. The secret is to keep ourselves in the spirit all the time.<p>Many may know the doctrines, teachings, and sayings of the Gospel of John, but few have found the secret of how to get into the enjoyment of the things revealed there. If we are going to enjoy Christ as the living water, we must come back to the spirit. Many who have experienced the so-called gifts of the Spirit have said that they were watered through the practice of the gifts. But strictly speaking, these gifts are without, whereas the living water is within. The living water springs up from within our innermost being. We must learn to turn within. We should not pay attention to the outward teachings, forms, and gifts. Rather, we should turn and pay our full attention to the spirit within.<p>The all-inclusive Christ dwelling in our spirit is a heavenly mystery within us which no one can exhaust (Col. 1:26-28; 2:2). The more we turn ourselves to the spirit and remain there to contact the Lord, the more we will sense that He is the exhaustless One. As we turn to our spirit, we sense a flowing and springing up within which waters us, and spontaneously we will water others. Whoever contacts us will be watered by this living outflow. This is the way to enjoy Christ as the living water. This is not doctrine. Our need is to practice to turn ourselves back to the spirit and remain there with the Lord. Then we will enjoy Christ as the living water.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO BE NOURISHED BY THE LORD AS FOOD</h2><p>The fourth item of the enjoyment of Christ is the matter of food. As we turn to our spirit, we sense enlightenment, refreshment, and nourishment. While we are reading the Word, we must learn not to exercise our mind too much. If we exercise our mind too much when we read, we will be exhausted instead of being satisfied. We must learn to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, praying more than we read. As we do this we will sense that we are being nourished, satisfied, and strengthened, having something of Christ ministered into us. If we would practice this, I cannot tell you what kind of sweetness, preciousness, and richness we would enjoy! Many Christians do not have a time with the Lord, and many of those who desire to be with the Lord, do so in a wrong way. Many of these brothers and sisters study the Word and read it by exercising their mind too much. They do not know how to turn themselves to the spirit in order to touch the Lord and meet with Him. Learn to turn to the spirit. This is the only way to enjoy Christ as light, air, water, and food. If we learn to turn to our spirit, the whole church will be turned, and there will be a great change in the church life.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS THE ABODE</h2><p>The last major item of the enjoyment in the spirit is Christ as our abode. It is only as you turn yourself to the spirit and remain there that you abide in Christ. To remain in the spirit is to abide in Christ. When you are abiding in Him and He is abiding in you (John 15:4-5), you have the sense that you are one with Him, mingled with Him. At this time you realize that He is the vine (John 15:1) and that you are one of the branches of the vine (15:5) enjoying all the richness, sweetness, and fatness of the vine tree. As the vine, He is everything to us. We are in Him and He is in us. We abide in Him, taking Him as our abode, and He abides in us to be the Dweller within us. What a wonderful life this is in oneness with Him! No human word can adequately explain this wonderful mystery. Our abiding in Him and His abiding in us are a mystery, yet this mutual abiding is a fact, a reality, to be experienced by us. Therefore, we must learn one thing and pay our full attention to this one thing, that is, to always turn back to the spirit. Whenever we turn to the spirit, we will be in light, we will have air, flowing water, nourishing food, and we will enjoy Christ as our abiding place, our abode. This is the proper way to enjoy Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; 4:7-8, 14-16; 12:9</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</h2><p>First Corinthians is a foundation for the book of 2 Corinthians; therefore, 2 Corinthians is much deeper than 1 Corinthians. First Corinthians shows us that Christ is our divine portion (1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 30). He has been given to us as wisdom, including righteousness for us to be justified and regenerated, sanctification for us to be transformed and brought into a full realization of Christ, and redemption for us to be redeemed or transfigured in our body (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ has been made such a portion to us as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) that we may contact Him through and by our spirit. We are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Now He is waiting for us to enjoy Him all the time. These are the basic points mentioned in 1 Corinthians. These points concerning Christ are the foundation for Paul to build upon in the second book. This foundation is Christ (1 Cor. 3:10-11) not only as our Savior, Master, and Lord but also as the portion given to us by God as wisdom, including righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.<p>As we look into the contents of 2 Corinthians, we must keep in mind the foundation given in 1 Corinthians. Second Corinthians 3:6 says, &#8220;For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; It is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), who gives life. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; The Spirit here refers to the Spirit in verse 6. The Lord is the Spirit who gives life. Verse 18 continues, &#8220;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title indicating strongly that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. In 2 Corinthians 4:7, the treasure is mentioned: &#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&#8221; Christ as the Spirit, the Lord Spirit, mentioned in 3:17-18, is our treasure, our unsearchably rich portion. How do we enjoy Christ as the treasure within us? We enjoy Christ by being in spirit. Even this word may be a doctrine to us. The condition among many in Christianity is not very powerful because there is too much knowledge apart from the living Person of Christ. This knowledge distracts people from Christ. God&#8217;s intention is not to give His chosen people doctrines, teachings, or gifts. God&#8217;s intention is to give His chosen people the living Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION FOR US TO LIVE BY CHRIST</h2><p>As human beings, before we were regenerated, we were born and raised by our parents to live by ourselves, that is, by the life in our soul. Some of us lived in a good way and others lived in a rather poor way. Regardless of whether our living was good or bad, we lived by ourselves. We lived by the self, the fallen soul. One day we were saved. To be saved means that we experienced God&#8217;s salvation which is Christ Himself, and Christ alone. God&#8217;s salvation is Christ Himself with redemption, forgiveness, justification, regeneration, and many other items. Things such as redemption and forgiveness are not salvation itself. Salvation is a living Person-Christ Himself.<p>After we are saved, we have two things within our being-our self and Christ. Following our being saved, God&#8217;s intention is that we live absolutely not by ourselves anymore, but by Christ. This is simple in teaching or doctrine, but it is not so simple in our daily walk. Many teachings in Christianity focus on different aspects of human life, yet neglect the central aspect of living by Christ (Phil. 1:21a). Our real need today is to live by Christ. If we are honest and faithful, we have to admit that we do not live by Christ from morning to evening.<h2 class=head1>THE OUTER MAN AND THE INNER MAN</h2><p>The apostle Paul in the book of 2 Corinthians builds upon the foundation laid in the book of 1 Corinthians by pointing out the contrast between the soul and the spirit. However, in 2 Corinthians Paul does not refer to them as the soul and the spirit, but as the outer man and the inner man (4:16). Instead of referring to the soul and spirit as mere parts within the human being, he referred to them as two men-the outer man and the inner man. If the soul was just a part within our being, our dealing with the soul would be simple. The same would be true for the spirit. However, the spirit today is not simply a part within us; it is a man. We should realize that each one of these two, the soul and the spirit, is a man. Therefore, we have two men within us-the outer man and the inner man. The life of the outer man is the self and the life of the inner man is Christ. We have two men with two lives. The self-life is the life of the soul, and Christ is the spiritual life of the inner man.<p>The unbelievers, who do not have Christ in them as their life, do not have the controversy between the outer man and the inner man. They just live by themselves. Christians who have received Christ are complicated because they have received another life into them. They have two lives within them. Therefore, Christians are bothered by the Lord within them all the time. If we had not received Christ, we would simply live by ourselves and not have any bothering. Since we have received Christ, however, we are involved with Him and are bothered by Him all the time. Now that we have received Christ, we will be involved with Him for our entire life. We may want to divorce Him, but He would not divorce us. The reason we are bothered is that, although we have Christ as our life, we often do not like to live by Him. So there is a controversy, a problem. On the one hand, we like to have Christ as our life, but on the other hand, we may not like to live by Him. We have received Christ, but instead of living by Him, we live by the self.<h2 class=head1>THE CONSUMING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Christ has been laid as a foundation within our being, but we are not in agreement with the structure to be built upon that foundation. In this kind of situation, we need the outer man to be broken. Under the sovereign hand of the Lord, there is the breaking of the outer man. In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul mentions that the outer man is decaying. Some translations such as the King James Version say perish, and Darby&#8217;s New Translation translates this word as consumed, which seems to be a better rendering than perish. To be consumed means to be torn down; that is, the outer man is torn down. This tearing down is that we may no longer live by the outer man. This is not an easy job because from our birth we were raised and educated to live by our self. Therefore, to give up our self is not easy. Yet the giving up of our self is the teaching needed by today&#8217;s Christians.<p>The Normal Christian Life, which was first released in spoken form by Brother Watchman Nee in about 1938 or 1939, has become quite prevailing throughout many of the Western countries. This book is primarily concerned with the foundation of the Christian life. However, another book entitled The Release of the Spirit, a series of messages given about ten years later by Brother Nee, contains something as a structure built upon the foundation. Hence, the later messages are a development of the earlier ones. The breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit are the messages needed by the church today.<p>First, we all must know what Christ is to us. This is the foundation. He is our life and our portion. He has been put into us as the treasure. This is the foundation. Now if we are going to build upon this foundation, our outer man must be consumed that we may live not by the outer man but by the inner man. The inner man is neither Christ Himself solely, nor the human spirit itself alone. The inner man is the human spirit regenerated and indwelt by Christ and mingled with Christ.<p>Today we need to cooperate with this consuming work. The more we cooperate with this work, the more problems we will be saved from. If we struggle, going against this breaking down work, then we will experience more problems. We need the real willingness to say to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I have been regenerated and I now have You within me as my life. I am clear that I have to give up my own life, the soulish life, that I have to take You as my life, and that I must live by You. Lord, I am willing to cooperate with You.&#8221; Such a prayer will save a lot of trouble.<h2 class=head1>DENYING OURSELVES TO LIVE BY CHRIST</h2><p>You should not look to the help of teachings alone. Teachings alone will not help you. There is only one thing that will help you-to realize that Christ is within you as your life and that you must learn to live by Him, not by yourself. The teachings as well as the gifts are not so effective. You need a silent faith, the faith within to realize that Christ is such a living One within you. You also must learn to deny the self (Matt. 16:24). One of the central teachings in the four Gospels is that we must deny the self (Matt. 16:24-26; 10:39; Luke 9:23-25; 17:33; John 12:25). In the Epistles, to walk by and live in the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 18, 25; 3:3; Rom. 8:4-5, 13) and to live by Christ (Phil. 1:20-21; John 6:57) are mentioned frequently.<p>There is no other way to enjoy Christ. We must learn on all occasions, daily and at all times, to deny ourselves. Although we may have heard this word many years ago, we must take it today as something living for us. If we would deny ourselves, turn to the spirit to contact the Lord, and live by Him, we would see the consuming of the outer man and the renewing of the inner man. We would see a real decrease of the self and a real increase of Christ. Then we will enjoy Him and we will realize that His grace is really sufficient in our daily experience (2 Cor. 12:9). With this kind of experience, regardless of what happens, there is the inner strengthening, supporting, and all-inclusive supply, which is the sufficient grace. This inward grace becomes the strength, the power, which is made perfect in our weakness. The weaker we are, the more we will realize the grace which is constantly strengthening us into the inner man. In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the saints would be strengthened with power into the inner man that Christ might make His home in their hearts, that is, that He might take over their entire being.<p>Our need is just to cooperate with Him. God&#8217;s intention is that we would put our natural life, the soul-life, aside all of the day and take Christ as our life to live by today. We have a natural life and a spiritual life. God&#8217;s intention is not to adjust or improve the natural life, but His intention is that we deny the natural life to live by the spiritual one-to live by Christ. Regardless of the circumstances, our need is to learn to live, move, behave, and have our being by Christ, not by our self. As a result, we will enjoy Him and realize that He is really the treasure within us. We will sense His preciousness and sweetness day by day and hour by hour. We will also sense how sweet He is, taking care of us in all kinds of circumstances, and we will realize in our experience that His grace, which is just Himself, is so sufficient.<p>Ultimately, we will testify like the apostle Paul that we are &#8220;well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, and distresses, on behalf of Christ&#8221; because whenever we are weak then we are powerful (2 Cor. 12:9-10). We are weak in our old being, but there is another One living within us. This is the central message given in 2 Corinthians. The many biographies, autobiographies, and the history of many of the saints confirm that there is only one lesson to learn-to put aside the natural life and take Christ as our life to live by Christ. As regenerated persons, we must put ourselves aside and take Christ as our life in a practical way.<p>We must live this way not only with outsiders but also with our own folks, our own family members. Deny yourself and take Christ as your life. Let the outer man be consumed and the inner man be increased all the time. If we would practice this, Christ would be so real, living, precious, and sweet to us. Praise the Lord! In 2 Corinthians the treasure, the power, and the grace are Christ Himself, who is so precious, sufficient, powerful, and near to us.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we do not need forms nor do we merely need doctrine or gifts. We need to learn to live not by ourselves, but by Him as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. We have two men within us. We must learn to live not by the first man, the outer man, but to live by the second man, the inner man. This is the way for us to enjoy Christ all of the time. We must take this word not as doctrine or knowledge, but as something to put into practice. Then we will see the difference. We will experience Christ as such a living One who is so real, sweet, and precious.</body></html>
