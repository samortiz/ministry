   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us read 1 John 4:6: "We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John was not at all apologetic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said that we should have the confidence that we are of God and of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who know God will hear us, and those who do not know God will not hear us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what John meant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows us that the apostles felt that it was not just a matter of whether or not one heard the sound, the physical voice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time John was very old.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who listened to him might have been very familiar with his voice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They could not have missed the voice of John.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet the strange thing is that John said only those who knew God would hear him; those who were not of God could not hear him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us clearly that it is not a matter of having or not having a voice or having or not having ears.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no problem with the ears; they can hear very well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet John said that those who are not of God could not hear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's word is in another realm, another world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not everyone who knows the Bible knows God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not everyone who can speak about the Bible can speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not everyone who receives the Bible can receive God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man has to build up a certain relationship with God before he can hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three verses in the Gospel of John can be put together and considered in parallel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These three references to the word spirit are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is Spirit, the Lord's word is spirit, and the Spirit begets spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's word is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, only a man of spirit can understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only things of the same nature can understand each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word which is outside is merely a voice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man can read the words of the Bible, study them, hear them, and know what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But within this word is something called spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is something that the ears cannot hear and the mind cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word of the Lord is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, it is impossible for the mind, the intellect, or any amount of human wisdom to understand this word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is likewise impossible for the mind, the intellect, or any amount of human wisdom to convey this word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's word is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, only those who are born of the Spirit will hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are born of the Spirit are men of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have something within them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With regard to God's word, a man must be retrained and reconditioned before he can hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is something that belongs to another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not something that belongs to the ordinary realm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By now, brothers, do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why must the outer man be broken?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because without such breaking, a man can never be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The outer man has nothing to do with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our wisdom, emotions, feelings, thoughts, and understanding are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Shortly, we will see that they do have some use.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we are saying here is that they are useless as fundamental organs for receiving spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's word is spirit, and only those who exercise their spirit will hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be very clear about this principle: God is Spirit and those who worship Him must do so with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is Spirit, and those who receive His word must receive it with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot receive spirit with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only things of like nature can receive each other.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nothing else will work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew 13:10-15 says, "And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.'"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The disciples asked why the Lord would speak in parables.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He answered, "Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given" v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Something happened in Matthew 12.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Certain ones blasphemed the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit, yet these ones hated the Lord so much that they insisted the Lord's casting out of demons was by Beelzebul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>28, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They knew very well that it was a work of the Holy Spirit, but they insisted that it was a work of Beelzebul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They knew that the Holy Spirit was the One who had done this, but they insisted that Satan, "the lord of the dunghill," was the one who had done this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To call the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, "the lord of the dunghill," was a blasphemy to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, in chapter thirteen, the Lord spoke in parables.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In other words, from that time forward, these people would see but not understand what they saw.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They would hear that a man went out to sow, but they would not know what this meant.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They would hear that an enemy came in to sow tares while the man slept, but they would not know what the tares meant.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They would hear that a net was cast into the sea but would not know what the casting of the net meant.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They would hear that a woman took leaven and hid it in three measures of flour but would not know what the leaven meant.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They would hear everything but not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>From the time the Jews blasphemed the Holy Spirit, they no longer heard anything but parables.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today we speak in parables in order to make people understand.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But when the Lord Jesus spoke to these people in parables, His intention was that they would not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord intentionally used the parables to keep them in the outward realm without understanding what the words really meant.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They only heard the outward letter of things, such as the sowing, the wheat, the tares, the net, and the leaven; they did not know what they meant.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many people today read the Bible in the same way that the Jews listened to the parables; they only know that the sower went out to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They only know about the good ground, the thorny ground, the shallow and stony ground, and the thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold return.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They do not know anything more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They hear the words, yet they know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the way many people read their Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They only see the outward things, not the inward things.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is interesting that the Lord Jesus purposely spoke in parables to keep them from understanding anything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Jews thought that they knew everything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Actually, they knew nothing.</S>
