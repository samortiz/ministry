<P>In some Christian weddings the pastor charges the man to love his wife and charges the woman to submit herself to her new husband. Although the husband and wife agree to do this, shortly after the wedding both of them may realize that they cannot do this. The wife realizes that she cannot submit herself to her husband, and the husband realizes that he cannot love his wife to the uttermost. To teach the husband to love his wife and the wife to submit herself to her husband is the ethical teaching of religion. Humanly speaking, there is nothing wrong with this. But according to God's economy, this is absolutely wrong. Ethical teachings are according to man's culture, not according to God's economy, not according to God's Spirit.</P><P>Instead of exhorting the husband to love the wife, and the wife to submit herself to her husband, it would be wonderful if the person marrying them would tell them: "Both of you need to realize that the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is in you. Don't make up your mind to submit yourself to your husband, and don't make up your mind to love your wife. That would never work. Instead, you need to open up yourselves to the Lord every day with an unveiled face. You need to turn your heart to the Lord so that there is nothing between you and the Lord, nothing between you and the Spirit. Every day, every minute, open up yourselves to the Lord who is the Spirit within you. Always say, 'Praise the Lord! Amen! O Lord Jesus! I love You, Lord Jesus.' Open up yourselves to the all-inclusive Spirit in such a way. Behold Him. If you do this, life will be supplied into your being. Life will be given to your spirit, to your soul, and even to your mortal body to make you persons of life. If you as a husband practice this, spontaneously in every instance you will love your wife. That will not be your love but the Lord Jesus within you. The Lord loves your wife, so you will love her too because you are one with the Lord. As a wife, if you practice this, spontaneously you will submit yourself to your husband. Whatever your husband says would not bother you because you are filled with the Lord Jesus within you. Then you will have a happy marriage life. As you practice this day after day, the life-giving Spirit supplies you life, and this life transforms you organically and metabolically, making you the same as the Lord in His glorious image. Then both of you will grow in life. You will even mature in life and will be so willing to be built up with others. Then you will not only have a good marriage life, a good home life, but also a good church life."</P><P>This is not religion, ethics, or mere doctrine. This is God's dispensing. This is the all-inclusive Spirit giving life to all those who are open to Him, which is much higher than ethics. In the Spirit are all the divine attributes plus all the uplifted and glorified human virtues. We need to forget about religion, ethics, and ethical teachings. We need to stay away from the letter that kills and pay attention to the Spirit that gives life. We need to treasure God's economy and enjoy His divine dispensing all the time. All day long we need to praise the Lord and call upon His name. We need to pray-read His word, fellowship with Him, and be filled with Him and saturated with His life. Then we will be transformed and grow in life to become the same image as He is.</P>
