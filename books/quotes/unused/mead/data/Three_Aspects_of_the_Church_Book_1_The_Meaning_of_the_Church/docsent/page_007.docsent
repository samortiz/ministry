   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God s Eternal Plan Being for Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, God s plan for the church is altogether for His Son Col 1:16; John 3:35; Heb 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God not only intends that His Son accomplish this plan, but He also desires that His Son inherit this plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever His plan accomplishes is for His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God desires that Christ would have a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In typology, God is typified by Abraham, His Son is typified by Isaac, and the church is typified by Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of Abraham s plans were for his son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, God s entire plan, God s arrangement, is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, this plan was made in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything Being Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The expression in Christ does not imply only that Christ is the One who accomplishes and inherits God s plan but also that everything in this plan is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the kingdom comes, we will be able to see Christ in many things and matters in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the new heaven and new earth there will be nothing that is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ will not merely be expressed; He will be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today, whenever we fellowship with a saint who is deep in the Lord, we sense that he has Christ in him and that coming to him is the same as coming to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A day will come when all things will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter what we touch, we will sense Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In that day all things will be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today people in the world have no way to be united, because they lack Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Things are not in harmony, because they lack Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must wait for the day when God has worked Christ into all things and when all things are Christ; only then will all things be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today people in Christianity speak of oneness, but they are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if there is some oneness among them, it is merely outward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genuine oneness is in Christ because oneness is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are in ourselves, we are not one and can never be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, when we live in Christ and when we give Christ the way and the ground in us through the cross, the result is oneness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This oneness is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, God s plan in Christ has a deep significance; that is, God intends to work Christ into all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may ask, Since God Himself is the resource, His power is the energy, and His wisdom is the means, in God s economy where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Colossians 2:9 says, In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 1:24 tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the economy of God s eternal plan God Himself is the resource, God s power is the energy, and God s wisdom is the means; moreover, Christ is God Himself, God s power, and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, after God made this plan, He appointed His Son to be the anointed One, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His Son is the Christ, the One who accomplishes His plan, inherits His plan, and is everything in His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, everything in this plan is full of Christ and wholly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every item and even every moment are Christ Himself.</S>
