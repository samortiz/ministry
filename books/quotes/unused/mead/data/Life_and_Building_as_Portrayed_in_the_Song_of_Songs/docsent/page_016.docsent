   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart" 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ultimately she becomes the very crown of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, we will consider the crown in greater detail.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's life and building can be seen</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within the Song of Songs;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He shows by types His seeking ones,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bride for whom Christ longs!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She, as a team of horses shows</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A love, so swift and strong!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is love that's natural</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It pulls the world along!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As time goes by, her concepts change,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With doves' eyes she can see</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That naught can with her love compare</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There's none so dear as He!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A lily she is now to Him</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For still the Lord draws on ;</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Her faith is not in earthly toil,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the wondrous Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She's next a dove who hides herself</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within the cloven rock;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now in her Lord's ascended life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is love which knows no shock!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of smoke, a pillar she's become,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And now, as wand'ring ends,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her will to His will is subdued,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What fragrance sweet ascends!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Behold His couch O, can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>E'en midst the fearsome night</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She now affords her Lord such rest,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The foe is put to flight!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A vessel to contain the King!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This type is full of worth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A palanquin He's made Himself</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For His move on the earth!</S>
