It was not like the situation of today's Christianity with little more than an eleven o'clock meeting on Sunday morning
In the entire New Testament the first place that mentions something regarding the meetings of believers is Matthew 18
The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 18:20 that where two or three are gathered together in His name, He will be in their midst
If you read carefully, from verse 15 through verse 20, you will see why and how the Lord spoke the word in verse 20
The Lord said in verse 15 that if a brother offend you, you must go to him and do whatever you can to recover him
Surely this is not a church in the heavens nor a church in the coming age-how could you go there to tell the church?
We all must see that in the eyes of the Lord, if we neglect to listen to the church, we become just as the heathen
His intention is to choose a people, a collective people, a corporate people as the Body of Christ, the church
If you are not built into the church, you may be a part of the church in nature, but in position you are still as a heathen
In all these years, those who have criticized and rebelled against the church have ended in a miserable condition
The Lord Jesus did not speak in this passage of rebelling against the church, He only spoke of neglecting to hear the church
Regardless of how spiritual you consider yourself, as long as you neglect to hear the church, in the eyes of God you are just as a heathen
Immediately following, in verse 18, the Lord Jesus said something about the exercise of the authority of the church
He said, 'Whatsoever ye bind, the heavens will bind, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, the heavens will loose'
The Roman Catholic Church says that this authority was given only to Peter; so today only 'the successor of Peter,' the Pope, has it
They neglect to see that in chapter eighteen the same authority has been given to the church, to the whole church
The context tells us that the meetings of the believers must be something of the church must be something which take the stand of the church
If we would meet properly, our meeting must be related to the church, and our meeting must belong to the church
Many Christians are meeting together, but they simply do not know that when they meet together they need the standing of the church
According to the context, the Christian meeting is something which is absolutely related to the church, the local church
In one day they suddenly had an increase of three thousand and in another day five thousand making a total of over eight thousand believers
What they were doing in their meetings was simply carrying out what the church in Jerusalem intended and decided
They were not isolated from the church; they were not meeting without the church in the locality as their background and standing
That meeting stood with the church in Jerusalem, and that meeting where the saints were praying was carrying out the decision of that church
Acts 8:1 tells us that though there were so many meetings in Jerusalem, yet there was but one church, the church at Jerusalem
Verse 20 of that chapter says that the number of believers in Jerusalem by that time was in the tens of thousands
We do not know how many, but have you noticed, in verse 18 of that same chapter, that there was only one eldership there?
There were myriads of believers and they were meeting in many houses in Jerusalem, but they were still under one group of elders
The first thing we must care for in the matter of meeting is that our meeting must be a part of the local church
All those home meetings are not isolated and independent meetings; they are in full relationship one to another and to the one church there
If the church has a very large number of believers, it is rather difficult, of course, for the whole church to come together
Because in verse 23 it says that 'the whole church be come together,' and in verse 33 it says, 'as in all churches'
When the whole church comes together, that is the meeting and that is also the church-the meeting is the church
Brothers and sisters, the proper way to meet is to meet either as a part of the church or as the church; otherwise, our meetings are wrong
If a few brothers meet here and there in the Lord's name without caring for the church, the Body of Christ is divided
Our meeting will not be a divisive meeting; it will be a meeting that stands with the church and executes the church's will
Whenever we begin to meet, we must meet for the church: either we meet as the church or as a part of the church
If this kind of arrangement and administration could be executed by a bank, why could it not be done by the church?
We have seen also from 1 Corinthians 14 that the church and the meeting, the meeting and the church, are identified one with the other
Those who attend them have no concept whatever of the church; so their meetings are not church related or church conscious
Strictly speaking, if we know the Word of the Lord, we will realize that to meet in a churchless way is actually sin
Many people are innocently sinful; yet still they are sinful, because they are dividing and damaging the Body of Christ
He came to the house of Mary, and when he arrived, there were many in that house praying; a meeting was in progress
The Bible does not clearly say that it was a meeting but if you read the context you will see that what occurred must have been in a meeting
In the early days it was different, and, of course, especially with the Holy Spirit, it is absolutely different
When the Holy Spirit inspired the book of Acts, He used the word 'church'-'great fear came upon all the church'
It says, 'Saul made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and hailing men and women committed them to prison'
We do need to abandon all our background that we may be so impressed with the church, that we may become church conscious
In chapter eleven verse 22 we have a very special verse Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was at Jerusalem
Whenever they met, they met in the church way, they met representing the church, they met for the church and as the church
Whatever they heard, they considered it was for the church, because they looked upon their ears as the ears of the church
We stress this matter again and again simply because people today are not church conscious; they do not care for the church
Chapter twelve, verse 1, says, 'Now about that time Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church'
As one in the Lord's work, if you are not definitely and positively related to a genuine local church, that is a sin
The contrast between the present situation and the early days, when all the prophets and teachers were in a local church, is striking
We should be prophets and teachers in the church not in a general way but in a local way just as they were in the church that was at Antioch
In chapter fourteen, verse 23, we see that Paul the Apostle and his co-workers established and ordained elders in every church
In verse 27, we see that when the apostles returned to Antioch, they gathered, not all the saints, not all the Christians, but the church
Notice verse 22: it pleased not only the apostles and the elders, but also the whole church to send certain men to Antioch
Again in chapter sixteen, verse 5, it says, 'the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily'
In chapter eighteen, verse 22, when Paul came to Caesarea, it says he went up and saluted the church-not the saints, but the church
Now we are in the Lord's resurrection, and in this record we can see many things regarding the matter of how we should meet
We must see the principle in each case, something spiritual, something divine, something deeper and even hidden
At the end of the four Gospels, we have the record of the Lord after His resurrection meeting with His disciples many times
All the disciples were Jewish people, godly people; they had the temple, and that was the place where they should meet to worship God
What about the offerings-the trespass offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering?
Peter, John, and all the disciples were so clear that Christ was resurrected and they no longer needed religion
not long after their meeting in the temple the Lord sent the Roman army to destroy the temple to get rid of all the background of religion
We must realize that that was not the right thing for Paul to do; it was a kind of degradation from the Lord's example
These meetings at the end of the four Gospels and the beginning of the book of Acts were the first meetings of the churches
Here we have the principle established for the way of meeting: we must meet outside of religion, without any form
He is no longer God's only begotten Son: now by His resurrection He has become God's firstborn Son , and we are the many sons of God
In today's Christian meetings one has the sense that those who attend are so much in the old nature and the meetings are still so natural
Really we all need to forget our position, our natural position, and take our standing in the resurrection of Christ
Sometimes by the Lord's mercy you have some good experiences of the Lord during the day; so you come to the meeting shouting 'Hallelujah'!
By the precious blood we can be immediately restored and enter into the meetings as the Lord's brethren in resurrection
We do have a standing for us to meet with Jesus: it is the standing of the brethren of Christ in His resurrection
They did not know it was the Lord, but later when they constrained Him to abide with them, their eyes were opened and they recognized Him
In the meeting they were told how the Lord was resurrected and had appeared to Simon, and it seemed that they said, 'Amen, we saw Him too'
When we come to the meeting, we have something bubbling and overflowing from us as a testimony to all the others
In our daily walk, we do need some extra portion from a sweet contact with the Lord Jesus that we may have something to bring to the meeting
He was resurrected in the area of Jerusalem; why would He go far to the north, to Galilee, to meet with His disciples?
The Lord did this deliberately, purposely, to move the Christian meeting away from the Jewish religious center
The meaning and purpose of the proper meeting is to give the Lord something to eat and also for Him to give us something to eat
Have you noticed that two times in the record of these meetings the Lord asked His disciples if they had something to eat?
Look into Darby's translation and some other better translations-they do not say fish, but just a part of a fish
When He asked them that day by the seashore if they had any meat and they answered 'No,' the Lord gave them a lot
What we can afford Him is just a little, just a limited portion, but what He can afford us is unlimited and inexhaustible
Have you realized that when the Lord was resurrected His disciples were immediately requested to meet together?
When we read Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1 and 2, we see that the disciples did nothing but meet
From the morning of the resurrection day the Lord began to meet with them not only with a good number in one place but also with one or two
Do you believe that in today's Christianity there is some real service rendered to the Lord on Sunday mornings?
When we meet with the Lord in His resurrection, we meet on one hand as His very brothers, but on the other hand we have to worship Him
It is the Lord breathing upon us that makes us alive; it is the breathing that gives life and imparts Christ into us
Perhaps in your entire Christian life you have never heard anyone speak about coming to a meeting to be breathed upon
In the first evening after His resurrection, the Lord came to His disciples, and the main thing He did was to breathe upon them
Our ears are open to Thee, our mind is open to Thee, and even the more, our spirit is open to Thy breathing, Lord
We have received some letters recently from some in a distant land who recently became acquainted with pray-reading the Word
They practiced it and were much impressed, but they wrote expressing the fear that they were not practicing it correctly
When He came to His disciples after His resurrection, He came as the life-giving Spirit and breathed upon them
We all need to help the new ones when we come together to give the Lord an opening to breathe something of Himself into them
We come together not to receive some teaching, but to be breathed upon by the Lord Jesus-to take in the Lord Jesus by breathing
The disciples were with the Lord for three and a half years before His resurrection, but they did not know Him well
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself'
We need a spiritual understanding with the Scriptures opened in such a way that we see all the secrets behind the writings
Today in every meeting we need to see the Lord Jesus as the resurrected One-not just to understand Him, but to see Him
Thomas was not in the first meeting with the Lord Jesus; he missed the opportunity of seeing the resurrected Christ with all the others
In all our meetings we need to see that the very Christ with whom we are meeting is the resurrected One and also the ascended One
Before the Lord Jesus came to meet with them, perhaps some were sorrowful, but when they saw Him they were excited and glad
When the people of Israel were ascending Mount Zion to be at the feast in the presence of the Lord, they sang the Songs of degrees
They should go something like this Oh we are going to see the resurrected Christ we are going to see the ascended Christ in our meeting!
It not only includes the Gospel preaching, but also the feeding of the lambs, the younger ones, and the sheep, the older ones
Pray over these chapters of the Gospels and the book of Acts again and again to be deeply impressed with these principles
After these two meetings, which were held behind closed doors in Jerusalem, the disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain appointed by Him
From the Mount of Olives, they returned to Jerusalem and went up into an upper room, where they met together for continual prayer
Today people say they are having Bible study meetings, prayer meetings, fellowship meetings, Gospel meetings, etc
John tells us that He met with His disciples on the one hand in a room shut up, secretly, and on the other hand by the seashore
These three books tell us clearly that this resurrected Christ who met with His disciples after His resurrection ascended to the heavens
It is also in this kind of meeting that Christ speaks and asks of us something to eat and offers us something to eat
When we are in the room, He is there; when we get to the mountain top, He is there; when we are backslidden at the sea, He is also there
The disciples were meeting in fear, the doors were shut, and suddenly there was Jesus standing in their midst saying, 'Peace be unto you'
Or speak to us as you did on the night before You were betrayed in John 14, 15, and 16, followed by a long prayer as in John 17'
There was just a short visitation just a little doing a little breathing a short message of two or three sentences and complete satisfaction
We should meet with the Christ who is the living Spirit; we should meet with the living Christ without any forms
We all must realize that whenever we as the disciples of Christ come together, we come with Jesus, we bring Him with us
Never forget that these meetings with His disciples after His resurrection were Christ's first meetings with the whole Christian church
In the past years in the local churches we have seen some behavior in the meetings which has not been so becoming
Because we are aware of the background, the dead religion, and we shrink from regulating things and forming another kind of meeting
He did not go to the temple to meet His disciples; He went to some shut up room, He went to a mountain in Galilee
To meet with Christ, we need to breathe in Christ as life, but to meet for Christ, we need the rushing mighty wind to blow upon us
After the resurrection the disciples were in Jerusalem: they were frightened, they were under threatening and persecution
He had to ascend from the Mount of Olives; therefore He asked all His disciples to go from Galilee to Jerusalem to see Him off
How could they afford to go so far and stay so long in addition to being in a situation of threatening and persecution?
Many have settled here and gotten jobs, but their main purpose is not to get settled and find jobs, but to attend the meetings
Brothers and sisters, we must be here not for our business, not for our schooling, not for our families, but for the meetings
In meetings with the resurrected Christ, the main factor is the breathing of the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit
In all the meetings with the resurrected Christ we see Christ breathing Himself into His disciples as the breath of life the Spirit of life
In all these stories of Christ meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we must receive something as a life supply
He met with them individually, in two's or more, and at least five or six times according to the record with them all together
After that, in the same morning, He appeared to a few sisters together as they went to tell His disciples that He was risen
The fifth instance of His appearing was that night, when He appeared to all the leading disciples in the room with the doors shut
The sixth was the following Lord's day, seven days later-at that time He appeared again to His leading disciples including Thomas
John said that he did not record everything-if he did, 'even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written'
Based upon this principle, we must look at these verses to see not a story, but a portrait revealing something
If you are one who is seeking and loving Him, He is with you; or if you are one who has failed like Peter, He is also with you
He just disappeared in order to train them in order to help them realize not only His visible presence but even more His invisible presence
When you are quite conscious of the Lord's presence sometimes, it is not as good as when you are unconscious of His presence
When they were so frightened and disappointed, yet with some startling reports of His resurrection, He suddenly appeared
On the resurrection morning she was the first at the empty sepulcher, and she was the first to pass on the information
Many times I've told people that we brothers are just so definite: when we behold the fact, we admit the thing
Many times we have this experience: the Lord visits us, not for some positive reason, but, unhappily, for a negative one
We have to come to the meeting to tell how we have met with the Lord and how He has met with us during the day
The Lord is recovering something on this earth which is absolutely different from Christianity and any religion
He is so living and present to us all day long that we cannot contain Him, we must share Him with all the people
It is quite interesting, as we have seen, that of the four Evangelists, two are for the resurrected Christ and two for the ascended Christ
Our meeting with the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mainly for breathing Him in, that we may partake of something of Him
We will forget about the old way of meeting-no more mere teaching and ministry, just breathing and eating and enjoying Christ
To meet together is not just a matter of enjoying Christ, but also a matter of functioning that the church may be built up
To meet with the resurrected Christ is for our enjoyment, but to meet for the ascended Christ is for the building up of the church
We have been clearly told that all the gifts have been given, not by the resurrected Christ, but by the ascended Christ
By His ascension He has received the gifts, and He has given the gifts to His church for the building up of the Body
If the Lord Jesus was only resurrected, we could have full satisfaction with Him, but the church could never be built up
As far as life is concerned, resurrection is sufficient, but as far as gifts are concerned, resurrection is not sufficient
In Los Angeles we have many meetings with the resurrected Christ, but on some occasions we also have meetings for the ascended Christ
Now we need to be exercised more that we may learn not only to meet with the resurrected Christ, but even more for the ascended Christ
To meet with the resurrected Christ we may have the feeling, but to meet for the ascended Christ we need not the feeling, but the faith
We can feel something of the resurrected Christ, because He is here; but how can we feel something of the ascended Christ?
The first group of people who were saved as recorded in the book of Acts were the three thousand on the day of Pentecost
One day, due to the Boxers' persecution and execution of the Christians, the market was closed, but he was within
We can tell the Lord's people that the baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished upon the church, the Body of Christ
We can claim the baptism and act upon it by living faith to function in the meetings for the building up of the Body
We need to be fully releasednot so much in the exercise of our physical bodies but in the exercise of our spirit the exercise of our faith
Everyone must be on the alert; everyone must be in the spirit, believing by living faith that he is joined to the ascended Head
Brothers and sisters, let us forget all the things we have learned in the past and simply learn to have these two kinds of meetings
The Lord Jesus told us here that where two or three are gathered together in His name, there He will be in the midst
We Christians are familiar with so many Biblical terms, but when we are checked as to the real meaning of these terms, we cannot answer
When Peter on the day of Pentecost addressed the people, he told them they must be baptized in the name of Jesus
The name of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit are the two matters that we see brought together in the book of Acts
In the Gospels we have the matter of meeting in the name, but in the Epistles it seems that the Apostles forgot all about the name
In the Acts we see how this matter has progressed from the seed to the harvest; therefore, the name and the Spirit are brought together
Now let us read John 14, verse 26: 'But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name
There is no need to speak about the name, because this is not the stage of the seed, but the stage of the harvest
The King James Version in 1 Corinthians 121 says Now concerning spiritual gifts and in 141 Follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts
The word 'gifts,' if you noticed, is in italics; it means that it is not in the original text; in the Greek there is not such a word
Chapter fourteen, verse 1, likewise, can be translated as, 'Follow after love, and desire to be in the spirit'
If you read chapter fourteen, you will see how many times the word 'spirit' has been used with small letter 's'
It is exceedingly easy for anyone to see that this does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the human spirits of the prophets
The way for Christians to meet is not to have forms, regulations, programs, and so forth, but just to exercise the spirit
The Holy Spirit is mingled with our spirit; therefore, when we exercise our spirit the Holy Spirit moves with us
As the prophet, if we do not take the initiative, if our spirit would not move, then the Holy Spirit has no way out
If our spirit moves, the Holy Spirit who is within our spirit will move with us and bring in the reality of the name of Jesus
If you read all the fundamental writings regarding the inspiration of the Spirit in meetings, they all say the same thing
Read 1 Corinthians chapters twelve and fourteen: you will see that we must desire to be in the spirit; we must desire to prophesy
It seems that it is out from you, but it is really something of God, because the very Spirit of God today is mingled with your spirit
We divided into pairs, and two of our feet were bound together so that each pair was forced to run with three feet
Some versions translate 1 Corinthians 12:3 in this way: 'No one can say Lord Jesus except by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit'
You may not be able to speak in tongues, but you can prophesy; you can say something for the Lord in the meetings
In the entire New Testament, 1 Corinthians is almost the only book that deals with the matter of Christian meetings
There is nothing mentioned regarding Christian meetings in the book of Romans, and in all the other Epistles there is barely a mention of it
In 1 Corinthians there are sixteen chapters, out of which we have one portion or section which deals with the matter of meetings
Undoubtedly, when we are in the spirit, there will be a certain kind of manifestation upon us-the manifestation of the Spirit
The greater gift is not speaking in tongues nor healing, but prophesying, for it is prophesying that builds up the church
Paul told us that we should covet earnestly the greater gifts, yet he said that he would show us an excellent way
On one hand Paul said, 'I encourage you to desire the greater gifts,' but on the other hand, 'I show you now an excellent way'
If you take the initiative with your spirit to prophesy, then the Holy Spirit, who is one with your spirit, will cooperate with you
Finally, in verse 39 the Apostle says, 'Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues'
The Apostle is so balanced: to speak with tongues is not so great, it is not so important as prophesying, yet we should not forbid it
Have you realized that both love and prophecy are things of the Spirit and that these are the very things that build up the church
In the middle of such a book we have this section, chapters twelve through fourteen, dealing with the meetings and the gifts
When we meet together, we can say something of Him whom we have already experienced and enjoyed in our daily living
It includes patience, meekness, endurance, longsuffering, humility; it includes all the virtues of the Christian life
We can never stand up to prophesy in the meetings in a proper way if we are not taking Christ as our life in our daily walk
To live by Christ, to take Christ as our life in our daily walk, is absolutely a matter of being in the spirit
You know that when you persist in arguing you are out of the spirit; you are exercising your mind and your emotions, not your spirit
If you have been exercising your mind and not your spirit in all your daily living, when you enter the meeting you will do the same thing
If we do not exercise our spirit all the day, every day, how can we exercise our spirit to prophesy in the meetings?
If we would simply turn to our spirit and say, 'O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah,' the Lord would be with us and be expressed in the form of love
If we do not exercise our spirit, sooner or later we will always reckon the faults and failures of the brothers
With such a habit it is easy to prophesy, it is easy to say something about the Lord and for the Lord in the meetings
Christ is our portion, Christ is everything to us, Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we are joined unto Him in one spirit
When we meet together, out of such an experience of Christ, it is easy for us to exercise our spirit to share something of Him
If you read the context of this book, you will see that the Apostle Paul deals with gifts just because he is dealing with the meetings
Let us start with chapter two, verse 2: The Apostle Paul said when he came to the Corinthians that he 'determined not to know anything
In 2:4, 'And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power'
It is indeed good that the King James Version does not render the word 'spirit' here with a capital letter 'S'
Do you think that if Paul commanded by the exercise of his mind or emotion he could say, 'Yet not I, but the Lord'?
He was one with the Lord in his spirit; so when he commanded in his spirit, he could say 'yet not I, but the Lord'
Paul had no commandment of the Lord, yet he gave his opinion 'as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful'
While Jesus was on this earth, He acted as a human being: He was so human, yet God was with Him, God was in Him, God was one with Him
In chapter seven verse 34 we read The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit
In chapter eight, verse 12, we read, 'But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ'
These two verses prove again that in order to take care of others' spirit we must take care of their conscience
Because according to chapter two, verse 2, the Apostle said that he determined not to know anything among them but Christ
We cannot just take a few verses from chapter twelve or fourteen and isolate them from the context of the whole book
Now all that He is to us must be realized, must be experienced not by any other organ of our being but the spirit
If we would be a right person and meet together in the right way, we must be this kind of person, like the Apostle Paul
To meet in the right way, we must be the right person, and the right person is one who lives, walks, and has his being in the spirit
In chapter six we are told that the Holy Spirit of God dwells in us and that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit
Do not think that one who is walking, living, moving and having his being in the spirit is so sure that he is spiritual
In chapter eleven we see that when we are not meeting in the spirit, we are meeting not for a profit but for a loss
From chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, we have seen that the two main things we need are love and prophecy
Finally in chapter fifteen we are told that this Christ who is our love and our life our prophecy and our function is the lifegiving Spirit
Suppose there is another group of brothers who like to have parties, to go to the beach, to see the movies, etc
It is not just a matter of doing this in the meetings, but in our daily walk with our children, our husbands, our wives
By taking Christ as our life and experiencing Him as everything day by day, we will have a spiritual savings account
We will continually deposit something of Christ into this account and have a rich surplus of our experience of Him
It will be so spontaneous for us to do so; it will simply be an overflow of what we have been experiencing of Christ all day
We need to come to the meeting with a new concept, realizing that we are in something new, that we are out of the old Christianity
We need to come in a new and living way, accustomed to exercising our spirit, with Christ as our life and with a rich surplus of Christ
It does mean to predict something in a miraculous way, but this is not the main, primary meaning of the word 'prophesy' in this book
In other words, Paul, in order to build up the church in Corinth, determined not to know anything among them but Christ
Now we must see that whatever we speak for Christ, whatever we do in the meeting, must be a demonstration of the spirit
He did not come to them to speak in tongues, but to speak with clear, understandable words, in an ordinary way
By linking these two verses and indeed the whole book, we see what the Apostle Paul means by the demonstration of the spirit
Chapter two, verse 4, with chapter fourteen, verse 6, proves that it does not mean something miraculous and supernatural
Paul did not preach in that way; he preached in an ordinary way with ordinary words; yet his speaking was the demonstration of the spirit
Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us a 'spirit of fear' or, according to a better translation, a 'spirit of cowardice'
When the whole church comes together, all can prophesy one by one , because everyone has something of Christ to share with the others
We learned that the church in Los Angeles seated the people in four directions; so we changed the arrangement of our chairs accordingly
Suppose that we are this kind of people; do you think that when we come together we could speak something for Christ?
The meeting is the demonstration of what we experience of Christ so we must have the proper walk in our daily life as a base for the meeting
Don't say there is no one listening to you-there are many listening; at least the angels and the devils are listening
The angels will listen to you, the evil spirits will also listen to you, and it will be a good exercise for your spirit
We should not be so dumb; we must learn to say something all the time for the Lord, regardless of whether we have a visible audience or not
These two things-speaking and singing-will help you be so living, active, and aggressive in functioning in the meetings
Punctuality, however, is not a strictly legal matter: if sometimes it is really impossible for us to be on time, the Lord knows
They must stand against their natural disposition, not act overmuch, and give opportunity for others to participate
Sometimes when you say O Lord in a mild way it really works but sometimes it does not work and you must shout O LORD AMEN HALLELUJAH!
Suddenly in Psalm 8 the Spirit came in with this: 'O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth'!
When the Pharisees spoke with the Lord Jesus concerning marriage and divorce, the Lord Jesus told them, 'From the beginning it was not so'
In the Psalms, it is said seven times, 'Make a joyful noise unto God' , and one time, 'Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise'
We must drop our backgrounds, and come to the meetings in the spirit and make a joyful noise to praise the Lord
Their praising caused an earthquake which released all the prisoners and eventually brought the jail keeper and his family to the Lord
In Ephesians we are told not only to sing and make melody, but also to speak one to another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
In Colossians chapter three, verse 16, we have two things put together: dealing with the Word and singing the hymns
If we could all learn how to praise and sing the hymns in our meetings, it would be much better than hearing a message
It says praise the Lord in this way, then praise the Lord in the second way, then praise the Lord in the third way, etc
Because by the end of the Psalms we have the city with the temple, we have God's habitation on this earth in the universe
God is not satisfied with this; God comes in and says that he who kisses the Son is blessed, he who puts his trust in the Son is blessed
Peter on the mount of transfiguration foolishly said Let us make here three tabernacles one for Thee and one for Moses and one for Elias
We have already considered Psalm 8: there is nothing in this Psalm about keeping the law, but even in Psalm 8 we do not have the maturity
Now we must learn something deeper concerning praise; we must see something not just in a general way, but in a deeper way
It is easy to speak concerning something superficial, but really difficult to convey a matter so deep and precious as this
The first part of the Psalm deals with the crucifixion of Christ: 'My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me'?
We come abruptly into the second part of this Psalm in verse 22, where the Lord says, 'I will declare Thy name unto my brethren'
By His resurrection God has begotten us , God has regenerated us as His sons; so we have become the brethren of the Lord
On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the people that 'this Jesus hath God raised up,' saying to Him, 'Sit Thou on my right hand'
If Jesus is at the right hand of God, how can He sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church?
On the day of Pentecost, when the Lord Jesus was in the heavens at the right hand of God, the church came into existence
When we are singing a hymn to the Father, Jesus, the firstborn among many brethren, is singing within our singing
Don't say Hallelujah any more unless you are assured that when you say Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus says Hallelujah within you
Psalm 8 tells us that from the youngest ones, the least ones, the weakest of such a race, God could do one thing-He could establish praise
God could establish praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings firstly by Christ's incarnation, by His identification with man
How we need to see the way whereby God can establish praises out of the mouths of us who are the weakest the least and less than the least!
You may have many children and may, materially speaking, be rather poor, but are you not more glorious than the greatest millionaire?
We must be sure that we are in the spirit, that we are speaking in the spirit, that we are singing in the spirit
To be like thunder means not only that there is a great noise, but that in this noise there is something majestic
Our praises, our Hallelujahs, must be a great noise, but with them there must also be something of majesty, something of weight
If we all learn to be in the Spirit, not pentecostal, not fundamental, but just spiritual, our praising will be like that
If we do not have this insertion, it is rather difficult to see more regarding the Lord's singing of the hymns of praise in the church
Praises have been established by the Lord out of the mouths of babes and sucklings: even the little babes can praise
If our experiences of Him have not reached a certain stage, when others sing praises so highly and deeply, we cannot follow, we cannot learn
The second main point of this Psalm is the dwelling place of God on earth-'That the Lord God might dwell with them'
Several times we see the words 'the dwelling place of God,' 'the habitation of God,' 'the sanctuary,' 'the holy place'
The victory in the battle, the victory won by Christ, is for the building up of God's habitation even today on this earth
On the earth usurped by Satan, among a rebellious people, God could accomplish such a marvelous thing as building up a habitation
Los Angeles is famous for new cults: all the strange things, all the far out things, all the evil things of the earth make their nest here
To my realization the city of Los Angeles which takes the lead in evil throughout the world is the best place for a testimony for the Lord
The victory of Christ is for the habitation of God on this earth, in this last age, among a rebellious and corrupted people
Now there is no need for God to isolate Himself in the heavens; there is no need for us to call upon Him long distance
Now we can speak with Him as children with their Father at home; we can speak with Him face to face in the local church
Not only do we enjoy all that God is to us, but we enjoy the spoils of Christ's victory-'The women that tarry at home divide the spoil'
The wings are covered with silver-this means that they are strengthened with the redemption of the Son, the all-inclusive death of Christ
The more we enjoy the spoils of the Lords victory the more we will mount up on these two wings empowered with the cross and all that God is
Psalm 68 is so deep; it is so full of Christ; it has so much concerning God's habitation and God as everything to us for our enjoyment
Sometimes at the day's end you call your children together and say, 'Let us praise and thank the Lord for all His blessings
My burden here is just this: we must have a thorough, a radical, a one hundred and eighty degree revolution in our praises
Christ put the divine life into the rebels Christ put the divine nature into the rebels and Christ filled these rebels with the Holy Spirit
He was reborn, he was converted and transformed, and after a certain time, Saul became Paul, the rebel became an apostle
In appearance you may be a man, in name you may be a man, but in reality we are all women; we are all weaker ones
But when they get the spoils, the wings of the dove, they will no longer lie among the sheepfolds; they will fly, they will be transcendent
You will have the spiritual strength of the Spirit with all the value of Christ's death and the fulness of God's divine life poured upon you
We are so accustomed simply to praise and thank the Lord that He loves us and that He died on the cross for us-all the time it is like this
Now let us go on to verse 24: 'They have seen Thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary'
To obtain His praises, God does not need the strong ones, the reckoned ones; he needs the unreckoned, the women and the children
If we are fighting, we all must be men, but now we are learning to praise, not on the battlefield, but at home in the local church
Today, with the enlightenment of the New Testament, we can see the entire history of Christ in these four figures
We have these two titles, these two names, ascribed to Benjamin-the son of sorrow, and the son of the right hand
By His incarnation and by all His human living, He suffered every kind of trial and hardship-He was really the son of sorrow
He was a warrior on this earth: He fought the battle and devoured the prey; He won the victory on the cross and got all the spoils
After His ascension, Christ was worshipped as the conquering Lion and enthroned with royal authority as the King of kings
In all our meetings we must learn to praise with a high standard, to praise God with little Benjamin and with Judah and their company
Concerning Zebulun he said, 'Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships'
Matthew 4:15 says, 'The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles'
All the first group of disciples who preached the Gospel, according to Acts 1:11, were called 'men of Galilee'
In the praises of the church there should be the element of Benjamin, the element of Judah, and the element of Zebulun and Naphtali
The righteous shall rejoice With a loud, triumphant voice, Singing praises, singing praises, Singing praises unto God!
The lone have found a family, Here the desolate a home; Prisoners are brought from bondage To prosperity unknown
For the flock-what wondrous grace- God prepared this dwelling place: Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen!
Now the Lord in mighty triumph Sends the news of victory; We the 'women' spread the tidings- 'Kings of armies flee, they flee'!
Lo, on high Christ hath ascended, Leading captives in His train; These as gifts He has perfected That the Lord may dwell with them
They have seen, O God, Thy goings In Thy holy dwelling place, Thy triumphal, high processions Midst a mighty voice of praise
Little Benjamin is leading, Then great Judah's company: Son of sorrow at God's right hand, Lion with the scepter see
Saints, thy strength has been commanded From the temple glorious; Still we pray that God may strengthen All that He has wrought for us
While He is there in the heavens interceding for us, He is also here in the midst of the church singing hymns of praise to the Father
He as the lifegiving Spirit indwells our spirit and we are one spirit with Him so when we sing from our spirit He sings within our spirit
If there were no meeting of the church, how could the Lord Jesus sings hymns of praise in the midst of the church?
If we put the passage in chapter two, verse 12, together with this, we will see that we should come together mainly to praise
Through him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips confessing His name'
It means that you have experienced Him that you have passed through Him through the Jesus of all thirteen chapters of this superlative book
In other words, your praise must be composed through Him, must be composed with Him, and must be constituted with the experiences of Him
In the beginning of this book it says that the Lord Jesus sings praises to the Father in the midst of the church
The wife tells the husband, and the husband tells the wife; the son tells the father, and the father tells the son
If we are so empty, if we are void of seeing Jesus, we will simply burden one another when we come to the meetings
If we are encouraged to function in the meetings, we will have nothing to say; we will have nothing to stir up the spirits of others
Suppose you have never seen a game of football; yet when you come together you try to talk and others encourage you to talk about football
Suppose, however, we have all just seen an exciting game-when we come together, everyone will have a lot to say
It is not till we turn ourselves to the spirit, till we get into the spirit, that we are immediately in the good land, the holiest of all
We all must learn to discern our spirit from our soul that we may enter into Christ and enjoy all that He is to us
When we are in the spirit enjoying Christ as the good land, it is rather difficult to tell others whether we are on earth or in the heavens
We have a deep ecstasy that we are mostly in the heavens touching the throne of grace obtaining mercy and finding grace for the timely need
The one written by Andrew Murray on this book, entitled 'The Holiest of All,' is an exception; it speaks much concerning our experience
If we do not have this experience, regardless of how loud we shout, we do not have the ecstasy and we do not have the response in the spirit
Just to see Him is not enough; just to look unto Him is not sufficient; just to consider Him is also not adequate
When the Israelites worshipped the golden calf while Moses was on Mount Sinai, they immediately became a religious camp in the eyes of God
Moses at that time moved out of the camp to be with the Lord, and everyone who sought the Lord went unto the Lord without the camp
Suppose that at the very opening of Hebrews we had this word, 'Through Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise
Through such a One whom you have experienced, whom you have enjoyed so much, offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually
Either we present Christ to the Father or we present Christ to others in the Fathers presenceboth are the best worship we can render to God
If we come to the meeting and say, 'Hallelujah, Jesus is my Lord; He is the little Benjamin,' it seems that this is not praise to the Father
The praises out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ, the spiritual praises to the Lord about Christ, are the best praise to the Father
For many years we have been trying to free ourselves from the way of meeting in today's Christianity, but we have not succeeded
We have seen that Matthew, the first book of these three, tells us that we must meet in the name of the Lord Jesus
The Christian life or the church life is a meeting life; if we do not have the meetings, it is impossible to have the church life
The Lord has shown us that after such a long book as the book of Hebrews, the last counsel we are given is that we all must praise
Many of us have been Christians for years and have heard many prayers and praises in the so-called Christian churches
In the praises of today's Christians it is really difficult to hear anything concerning the experiences and enjoyment of Christ
If we entered a Christian service today and began to say O praise the Lord here is Benjamin the son of sorrow the son of the right hand!
There are certainly thousands upon thousands of Christian books-good books, sound books, fundamental and spiritual books
To have this kind of meeting, a meeting with Christ singing within our singing, we need the adequate experiences of Christ
It is a book of Christ as so many better things, things which we must know in a way of experience and enjoyment
On the one hand He is the good land, and on the other hand He is Joshua, the companion of Caleb, helping Caleb to enter the land
Christ is our real Joshua, the One who brings us into rest, the One who brings us into the good land which is Himself
He is a high priest who continually ministers the riches of God to us just as Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to Abraham
He ministers Himself to us not according to the letters of the law, but according to the power of an endless life
From chapter eight through chapter ten, verse 18, we are told that the new covenant formed by Christ is much better than the old
Some say the heavenly gift is this and some say it is that but the book of Hebrews does not say this or that it just says the heavenly gift
If you merely read the Word with your mentality, it may be sweet, but it could never be so sweet as it is by pray-reading
It is the living Word that meets the need of the present time, and it is something for us to taste, not just to know or learn
If so, we will be filled with experiences which are so adequate and suitable for composing praises to God about Christ
The cream comes from the milk, the milk comes from the cattle, the cattle feed on the grass, and the grass grows on the ranges
We need the ranch, we need the grass, and we need so many living cattle feeding on the grass to produce the milk
If you are void of Christ in your experiences, it is impossible to offer praise when you come to the meetings; you are simply flat and empty
When you come to the meeting, and even while you are coming, you will be singing, 'Hallelujah, Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
The proper way for us to meet is with the cream of praises which issue from the adequate experiences and enjoyment of Christ
They knew all the doctrines; they not only searched, but researched the Scriptures; yet they would not come to the living Christ for life
To enter into the concept of any writer is not easy, and to get into the spirit of those who wrote the Scriptures is even more difficult
Also found in Judaism are the way to worship God, the sacrifices, the offerings, and all the ordinances established by God
Besides all this, in Judaism are the holy instructions of how to behave oneself both in the presence of God and among human beings
If they hold the silver and all you have is merely clay, could you persuade them to trade the silver for the clay?
The blood that sealed their covenant was the blood of a mere beast, but the blood that seals ours is the blood of the eternal Son of God
We who have the new covenant, however, are higher than the angels: the angels are just the servants; we are the heirs, the sons
The main thing is this: the writer had the concept that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the eternal One, is better than all things
He is the real Joshua to bring us into the good land, and He is also the real land with all its riches for our enjoyment
We not only inherit forgiveness of sins and the impartation of life but also all that God is all that He can do and all that He has planned
Such a qualification as these two natures, the divine and the human, is much better than a hundred PhD degrees
We have all been called into the participation of such a One; we have all been made partakers of Him and partners with Him
He is the Apostle here caring for all our needs, and He is the High Priest there handling all our cases in the heavenly court
If you would do this you must realize firstly that Judaism, the best and even the genuine religion, is a camp which rejected Jesus
As long as you insist on preserving the elements of Judaism, you keep yourself within the camp and separate yourself from Jesus
Jesus today is not within the camp; Jesus today is not within Judaism or any other kind of religious organization
We must realize that today the Holiest of all has two ends: one end is in the heavens, and the other is within our spirit
Whenever we are in the spirit, we are in the heavens, and whenever we are in the heavens, we may be assured that we are in the spirit
If today the Holiest of all were only in the heavens, how could we have boldness to enter as we are exhorted in Hebrews 10:19?
If you will only leave the camp to follow Him, you will be in the heavens and therefore in your spirit, the Holiest of all
We must consider Him, we must partake of Him, we must enjoy Him, we must look to Him, and we must go forth unto Him
Learn to know Him and learn to enjoy Him; then you will be filled with so many good matters and praises concerning Him
The more we are filled with Christ, the more we long for the meetings and require the meetings to express something of Him
The more we praise in the meetings, the more we enjoy the Lord's presence, for while we are praising, He praises in our praising
Our singing may yet be so poor and lacking in adequate content, for we are not yet accustomed to higher praises
We need to praise the Lord according to such a book; there is so much content for our praises from the first chapter to the last
Dear Lord, Thou art the Son of God, His absolute expression; In Thee God speaks to us today, Thou art His definition
The impress of God's substance true, Effulgence of His glory, Thou even art our God Himself, In Thee is His full story
By Thee was made the universe, Subsisting by Thy merit; The heir, God hath appointed Thee, That all Thou may inherit
Since Thou hast purged our sins by death, In heaven Thou art seated, Till all Thy foes will be subdued And all God's will completed
A better name than angels have, From God Thou didst inherit; As Son of God to us as life, Thou now art in the Spirit
Thy kingdom is of righteousness, Thy throne will stand forever; God hath in love anointed Thee, And Thou shalt wax old never
Thou also art a man indeed, With all our human nature; By grace Thou tastedst death for us That we may have Thy stature
With glory and with honor crowned, All things to Thee are subject; As Captain of salvation full, Thou art through sufferings perfect
By death the devil Thou hast spoiled, And from death's bondage freed us; Thou sanctifiest us in life And dost to glory speed us
To us, Thy brethren, Thou art here, The Father's Name declaring; Within the Church Thou singest hymns, God's praises with us sharing
Superior Thou to Moses, Lord, As to the house the builder; Thou, our Apostle sent from God, Art worthy of more splendor
Thou art our real Joshua, By Thee the rest we enter; Our full salvation is of Thee, Our faith on Thee doth center
Thou art the heav'nly rest to us, Now dwelling in our spirit, For us to enter as the land And all Thy good inherit
Superior Thou to Aaron too- Thyself, the offering given, Thou enteredst, as our Great High Priest, The holiest place in heaven
Thou art our true Melchisedec, With endless life in power, To minister the 'bread and wine,' In every needful hour
Thou art the better sacrifice, Through the eternal Spirit, Once offered unto God for us, That we may gain Thy merit
A better covenant was made With Thy dear blood in heaven; By Thee this sure new testament To Thy redeemed was given
Lord, Thou art now within the veil, As our unique Forerunner, That by Thy life, without the camp, We'll in the race be runners
Thou art the Finisher of faith, As well its Author perfect; By faith and love we follow Thee, And e'er to Thee are subject
Unequaled is Thy worth, dear Lord, And all Thou art we treasure; Thou art so perfect and complete, Beyond all human measure
In Revelation chapter five, verse 8, we are told that the living creatures and elders in the heavens have every one of them harps
The New Testament is a book of statements and definitions; to see the pictures we must go back to the Old Testament
It is that of two way traffic, the coming and the going: the ointment is coming to us, and the incense is going to God
We should not only have one way traffic: we should not only have Christ coming to us without Christ going back to God
Three is always the number of the triune God, and four, the number of creature, the human being, in a good sense
It is God mingled with man, God compounded with man, divinity mingled and compounded with humanity to produce the incense
The first and the third, the stacte and the galbanum, are of the plant life; they are gums from certain kinds of trees
Now look at the picture: the first and the third are of the vegetable life, and the second, the middle one, is of the animal life
In one sense His life is a generating life: He is the grain of wheat that produces so many more grains of wheat
In order to redeem us, there is the need of the second Person of the Godhead with the aspect of the animal life to be slain on our behalf
The death of Christ in a sense is not so pleasant, but it really strengthens, it really keeps, and it really expels
When we put all these concepts together we see that the incense is just Christ as God, incarnated to be a man, who died and was resurrected
Divinity mingled with humanity suffered death to impart His life to us, to redeem the fallen ones, and to expel all the poison
In the prescription for the ointment recorded in Exodus 30, definite quantities are designated for each ingredient
In the entire universe there are no means available to weigh Christ, there is no scale large enough to measure Him
You may have studied modern science-can you tell how long is the length, how high is the height, or how broad is the breadth?
The answer is this: the length is just Christ, the height is just Christ; the length is as long as Christ; the height is as high as Christ
All that Christ is, all that Christ does, is a kind of incense before God; His fragrance is unchangeable and incorruptible
Sometimes it seems that we have some experiences of Christ, but they do not remain long; they are here today and gone tomorrow
Three days ago brother so-and-so may have given a marvelous testimony, but tonight when he is speaking, there is a clear sense of oldness
Suppose then that while she is speaking one of the brothers interrupts her and asks her to abbreviate her testimony
Anything after being burnt is reduced; it is not so great in form or in quantity, neither is it so fine in quality
The experiences of Christ are indeed good and fragrant to us, but they need to be burnt that they may be fragrant to God
Only when we are seasoned, broken, and burnt, will the church be built up, and we will have the fragrance of burnt incense to God
We will have a little heap of ashes, not much in form or quantity, and not even so good in quality, but so sweet and fragrant to the Father
Experience is indispensable for the burning of the incense- the experiences of Christ, seasoned, beaten and burnt
These must be offered not in our home, but in the tent of meeting for the building up of the local church, God's dwelling place
We have also seen that the incense is mainly of four ingredients, but that there is another fifth ingredient, salt, added in
The Person and work of the Lord Jesus as a kind of incense is immeasurable, yet so balanced and equal in every direction
We need practice to be delivered from praising in the old, traditional way and to learn to praise God with the incense
Our praises must have Christ as their content, that we must praise God with Christ, with all that He is and all He has accomplished
In the tabernacle, the type of God's house in the Old Testament, there were two altars, the outer altar and the inner altar
If you consider the diagram of the entire situation according to the arrangement of all these utensils, you will see the figure of a cross
On the two sides are the showbread table and the lampstand, both in one line, which forms with the other line a cross
Only at the offering altar and at the incense altar can we find our shelter and rest, not only for ourselves, but also for our young
Every kind of sacrifice upon the altar of offering is consumed not by any fire of earth, but by fire from heaven
In Leviticus 9:24 we read, 'And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat
To burn the incense simply means to pray and to praise God with Christ and all He has accomplished as the content of our prayer and praise
We all must realize that whenever we come to praise God at the incense altar, we must certainly have contacted the offering altar
There is no problem with the matter of redemption, we have all been redeemed-we are exceedingly clear about that
Undoubtedly God is satisfied with that; yet that is outward; that is something which is only in the outer court
What God requires is inner and deeper, not just in the outer court, but in the Holy Place near to the ark of testimony
If, when you come to the Lord, you bring just a little of this goodness of yours before Him, you are burning strange incense
When they come to a meeting which is full of praising and singing, of shouting and joyful noise, they are offended and extremely critical
Whether those who make noise are right or wrong is another matter, but to be dumb and silent is undoubtedly wrong
They should speak all the day long, either to God, to human beings, to the angels, to the demons and Satan, or sometimes to the creation
If we would minister in our priestly office, we must open our mouths to speak something, to pray, to praise, or to sing
He will cause us to burn the incense with a strange fire, with something natural which has never been dealt with
We speak much about the Lord Jesus as our life and salvation, and in this very matter of dumbness we need Him as our life and our salvation
Listen, not naturally emotional, but emotional in the spirit; not emotional with strange fire, but with heavenly fire
We need to offer praises, we need to be released, yet we still need to be dealt with; we need many dealings through the cross
We have to say to the Lord Jesus continually, 'We offer our praises to God under the covering of Your precious blood'
We also see in verse 46 a kind of burning of the incense which is in the power and effectiveness of the atonement
At that time the people of Israel sinned against God, and God judged them by sending among them a deadly plague
The remedy was fire from the offering altar with incense put therein-this could make an atonement for the people
Moses was to anoint the tabernacle, that is, the tent of meeting; then the ark of the testimony in the Holiest of all
Now note that the Lord does not go on to the altar of incense, but to the table of showbread, and then to the lampstand
Following these three items, the two altars are mentioned together, the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering
Physically speaking, between these two altars are three articles-the showbread table, the lampstand, and the laver
We must note that the entire arrangement of the tabernacle with all the items related to it are just for the burning of the incense
Look at the diagram of the tabernacle again: in the arrangement of all the vessels of the tabernacle the altar of incense is at the center
By this we may realize that the altar of incense is the very center, the very place where God is satisfied and we are accepted by Him
We need to be laborers to reap the produce, and then we must be the priesthood to offer the offerings, to handle Christ
We must know how to offer the trespass offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering
We need the washing in the laver, the washing of the cleansing Spirit, to rid us of all the dirt of the earthly touch
In present day Christianity people speak of meeting merely as two or three coming together in the name of the Lord
By looking at the picture you realize that to pass through all these steps we do need the laboring on Christ as the good land day by day
We are qualified to offer Christ, the compound, all-inclusive Christ, composed of so many fragrant ingredients, to God as incense
The most glorious among the twelve disciples was Peter-he was so exposed; the Lord continually put him on the spot
Brother Watchman Nee is so bold to say in some of his writings that the so-called fundamental Christian services must be done away with
Nee had the boldness to declare that the modern Christian services do not spring from the teaching of God but from the custom of the nations
There is usually an eleven o'clock Sunday morning service, set at that hour so that everyone may have an opportunity to sleep late
The churchgoers arrive for the time of worship but what is called the worship service is almost a period of entertainment and relaxation
If any of the pew members are asked to function, with few exceptions they will say that this is not their job, but the pastor's
To burn the incense we need the priesthood and we need the sphere of the priestly ministry, the proper tabernacle
You care for the Lord but in a silent way waiting for either the pastor the responsible brothers or the fulltime workers to do their job
On the other hand, we have this word, 'Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,' mentioned seven times in the Psalms
We need to be burned with the good matter of Christ, the King, and we need to be burned with the beauty of the church, the Queen
Brothers and sisters, if you come to the meetings and do not have anything bubbling over within you, you are certainly wrong
You have learned this experientially therefore you need to compose something out of this experience as a kind of new and living composition
When you come to the meeting you can offer this at the proper time as a bubbling over of what you have already composed
Our meetings then will all be newnot new in doctrine teaching or knowledge but new in the freshness of praises from our current experiences
We must forever gather new experiences and put them into praise, either by singing, testimony, or worship directed to the Lord Himself
From this there is no vacation: every day is a day for exercising our profession in composing praises to the Lord from our fresh experience
If we have composed something beforehand, when we arrive in the meeting, our tongue will be the pen of a ready writer
We have already mentioned how seldom praises concerning Christ Himself are heard in the meetings of today's Christianity
If we would praise the King, we cannot forget to utter something concerning the Queen, for the Queen is a part of the King
In the first section, the praise is to the King about the King ; but in the second section, the praise is to the King, but about the Queen
Psalm 45 is a Psalm about Christ and full of Christ, yet it is written from the various standpoints of human relationships
When we come to the book of Revelation, we also see Christ's glory in His church and in His children, His princes
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured upon thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee forever'
From verse 3 through verse 5 we have Christ's accomplishments-the fighting, the overcoming, the riding through
Righteousness represents the things related to God, and wickedness the things related to the wicked one, Satan
Whatever the Lord does is always based upon the principle of His death and resurrection and therefore is filled with these fragrances
Eve was formed out of a bone from Adam , typifying the church which has come out of the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ
The ivory palaces are not the heavenly mansions, but the local churches, which issue from Christ's resurrection life
When we come to the end of the Scriptures, we see the completed building; it is the bride, the wife of the Lamb
In this Psalm we see the church on one hand as the dwelling place of the Lord and on the other hand as the wife of Christ
When we say, 'Praise the Lord for the church in Los Angeles,' or, 'Praise the Lord for the church in Houston,' He is well pleased
Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises
If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the eyes of the King
In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord
Verse 12: 'And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favor'
Now this wrought gold, this Christ, is our clothing, our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God
Wrought gold is sufficient for us to be in the presence of God, but we need an added factor that we may stand in the presence of the King
We will have two robes: the first is for God the Father's satisfaction; the second is for Christ's satisfaction
In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being
Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second robe that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ
In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes
All the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, 'O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth'!
Verse 17: 'I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever'
Our tongues as pens are ready, We've volumes here to 'write'- The glories of our Bridegroom, Our Lord and our delight
The queen in gold of Ophir At Thy right hand doth stand; Kings' daughters are the women Who fill Thy honored band
The church in all her glory Shall match her glorious King, And all the saints, the women, Thy likeness there shall bring
Tis by the Spirit's stitching That Christ in us is wrought, And with this glorious garment We'll to the King be brought
Our coming to the meeting should be a kind of preparation; it is our opportunity to be properly prepared for the meeting
We will look shortly into some verses in the Psalms which show how the Old Testament saints came to their meetings
They were the Old Testament saints, they were under the law; we are the New Testament saints, we are under grace
Certainly our experience should surpass theirs in the matter of coming to the meetings, but in fact we have fallen far behind
In the Psalms we see that when the saints of ancient times came to the congregation of the Lords people they came with at least seven things
My soul panteth, yea, even is homesick for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God'
If you really love the meetings, you will say that the church meetings are your practical home, your practical family life
They are searching desperately for something more but they have not found it so they run to nightclubs parties movies and many other things
When you enter the right meeting, the spirit within you, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit, gives you the sense that you are home
If we really love the meetings, we can frequently find a way around the circumstances or through the circumstances to be there
We all can testify that the Lord does not grant us a great amount of comfort simply by contacting Him in nature
At home we can fellowship with the Lord and at the same time care for many other things; we can kill two birds with one stone
Nothing else can give us the blessing, the comfort, the life, the light, the edification, and the building up, etc
You may complain that the noise of the meeting bothers you, that you cannot bear a meeting so full of the sound of praise
The problem is that you are under the influence of your background, you still have your human concept, and you are too religious
We must be careful: we may not like something, but the Lord likes it; we may not like the noise, but the Lord likes it
Ninety percent of the newcomers to the meetings accept the noise of joy and praise; only about ten percent turn away
The brothers of the church in Los Angeles can testify that when their meetings were silent they had very little increase
The church could be wrong, and many times the church is wrong, because the church is composed of so many fallible human beings
We should not go to the house of God individually, but in company if possible; not just one by one, but group by group
We need not wait till we enter the meeting hall before we shout our Hallelujahs and sing our praises to the Lord
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name'
Before arriving at the meeting, while we are still on the way, how good it is to begin to offer our thanksgivings and praises to Christ
If you get into the Word of God and compare what is there with what exists in today's Christianity, you will be amazed
We need more and more practice-not just to listen, to know, or to understand, but to exercise what we have received
It is not that God Himself does something without us nor that we ourselves do anything without Him-it is that we cooperate with God
It is wrong to say, as many do, that we must wait for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit before speaking in the meetings
To have the proper meetings we must all learn to deal drastically with this subconscious influence and take up our responsibility
Every one would function livingly and spontaneously, praying, praising, or giving testimony in whatever way we may turn them
When we demonstrate our spirit the Lord will be exhibited-this is a glory to the Lord and a real shame to the enemy
We have the deep conviction that the Lord has turned the age from the age of religion forms doctrines and teachings to the age of the Spirit
Simply open yourself to the Lord and utter something from deeply within your spirit-short, quick, real, and fresh
Of course, this requires considerable sensitivity and life in the spirit, but by continual practice we will all improve
Sometimes you may come to a meeting and begin to speak; but after just two sentences you will sense that you are out of the flow
Please note that in order to care properly for the flow of the meeting it is not good to speak much in detail or to occupy too much time
By so doing, the flow of the meeting will be uplifted; otherwise, it will be choked and the spirits of the saints cooled
Suppose now that there is a break in the flow-the subject is suddenly changed by one who is not so well experienced in the spirit
If you begin to speak and you hear others speaking, immediately stop your voice and let the others finish their praise
We are not speaking to ourselves, but to the Lord before others; so we all must learn to speak in such a way that others may hear
Some brothers and sisters are bold in speaking and skillful with the materials, but their voice is not adequate
You see, this is not just a kind of quotation, repetition, or interpretation of the words of the verses, but an application to experience
A sister may say, 'Yes Lord, my tongue has really been writing Your praise today for Your presence in my suffering'
Our aim must always be to uplift, enrich, or intensify the spirit, whether by singing, testimony, praise, or any other means
We must learn how to shout, how to speak, how to testify, and how to call for a hymn or a chorus to meet the need
We will have nothing predetermined, nothing set or fixed; we will be so new and coordinated in one spirit, following the flow all the time
We brothers, on the other hand, are too bold; we must give opportunity to the sisters that they also may enter in
Of course, we all must take responsibility to go on without undue hesitation and waiting; yet we must still care for others
With the doctrine of newness, you can finish in two sentences, and you may just find yourself repeating, 'newness, newness, newness'
There are many doctrines regarding His name, and, of course, it is so easy to release some testimonies on this matter
We could continue our praising of the name of the Lord for one hundred days and not be exhausted, but we need the skill
We need more and more practice, however, that we may obtain a better coordination one with another and render the best cooperation to God
If we learn to meet together in this way with the proper skill, our meetings will be so sweet, so rich, so inspiring, and so edifying
Every time we come to the meetings, we must come fully open to the Lord, not knowing just how the meeting will be carried on
There is no need to decide that tonight we will praise the Lord for His name or His victory or some other topic
We all must learn, therefore, how to exercise our spirit, release our spirit, strengthen our spirit, and demonstrate our spirit
