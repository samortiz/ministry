   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To understand the Spirit's work in applying Christ's accomplishments, let us consider how the Spirit is gradually revealed throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first time the Spirit of God is mentioned is in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is God the Spirit in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of God brooded over the death waters for God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After creating man, God remained intimately involved with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His relationship with man God's title is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why in the Old Testament the Spirit of God is usually called the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah has to do with God's reaching of man Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3:10; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The main titles used for the Spirit of God in the Old Testament are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the incarnation the Spirit of God was called the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Andrew Murray in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, points out that the divine title, the Holy Spirit, is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Psalm 51:11 and in Isaiah 63:10-11 the "Holy Spirit" should be translated "the Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was when the time came to prepare the way for Christ's coming and to prepare a human body for Him to initiate the New Testament dispensation, that the term the "Holy Spirit" came into use Luke 1:15, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being Not Yet</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we come to a very hard point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus cried, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in verse 39 John explains that the Lord spoke this "concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John does not say the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, or the Holy Spirit, but "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He further says that when Jesus was crying out to the people, "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The King James Version says, "the Spirit was not yet given," but the word "given" is inserted; it is not in the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of God was in Genesis 1, and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon the prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why, then, in John 7 was the Spirit "not yet"?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Andrew Murray in his book The Spirit of Christ indicates that before Christ's glorification, that is, before His resurrection Luke 24:26 , the Spirit of God had only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when Christ was resurrected, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He were still only the Spirit of God, He would have only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Murray's word implies that the Spirit, in becoming the Spirit of the glorified Jesus following Christ's resurrection, now has the element of humanity.</S>
