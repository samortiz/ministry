   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING TRAINED AND WORKING IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PREPARATION FOR MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers and sisters who want to migrate must have special vocational skills.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church has to make arrangements in practical affairs related to the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the brothers and sisters must first be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They must be trained in vocational skills, and they must be trained in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An elephant in a circus may be clumsy at first, but after some training, it can dance and perform.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that the brothers and sisters will practice coordination in their occupation as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope that all their occupations will be for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They should coordinate together in their business so that they can make more money for migration and the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Students who are studying at school should also coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope that they will learn some lessons now for the gospel's sake so that in the future they can support themselves in a migration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the applicants for migration to Yi-Yang have good educations and high spiritual capacities, but we cannot use them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we can use concrete workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have good education but cannot support ourselves, we will present a problem to the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A concrete worker can support himself; therefore, he is useful to the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to prepare ourselves for migration, we have to do a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, brothers and sisters who have a burden to migrate for the spread of the gospel must have a practical skill.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may think that such training is very troublesome, but we have to remember the Lord's word that it is more blessed to give than to receive Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to learn to be those who give.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to learn to work with our own hands, not only to support ourselves but to support others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, the brothers and sisters must learn to do things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we can do things properly here in Hong Kong, we can do things properly in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to be trained by the church in the way we handle things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to learn the secret of preaching the gospel effectively and leading men to salvation effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Third, we in the church have to learn to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the brothers' and sisters' handing themselves over, we have turned the whole church into a school or a clinic; we will give practical training on how to diagnose people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope those who have heard this word before will become more and more clear of our way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the only way for the gospel to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From now on, all trainings, including trainings in the gospel, business affairs, and the study of the Bible, are under the leadership of Brother Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot live a leisurely and lazy life any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless some are unable to catch up physically, we want everyone to be on the alert, to busy himself, to gird up, and to catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the church in Hong Kong be like the army of God, a church that moves in military steps cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Num 1 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A FELLOWSHIP ON THE WORK IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Witness Lee: For almost half a year, I have stayed in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ninety percent of the brothers and sisters who were saved during the past half year had never heard the gospel before and had never touched Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Presently, twelve hundred people have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But one problem with these newly saved ones is that they still do not know the ground and the way of service.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Kaoshiung there are over three hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Last year only a few dozen were breaking bread there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are no so-called workers in Kaoshiung; every brother and sister has a job.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are all quite busy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the number of saved ones swarms in like a flood because everyone puts in his portion and is trained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In gospel meetings during the past Chinese New Year, over six hundred people received the Lord and left their names.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the brothers and sisters are young.</S>
