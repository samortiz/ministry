        <h2 class="head2">Five Offerings Recorded in Leviticus</h2>
<p>The five offerings recorded in Leviticus show in an even clearer way how Christ offered Himself up to God to redeem us (1:1&mdash;6:7). These five offerings speak of various aspects of Christ, and together they show that Christ is the one complete and perfect offering. The burnt offering typifies Christ who lived absolutely for God, who obeyed God even unto death (Phil. 2:8), and who offered Himself without blemish to God (Heb. 9:14). The meal offering typifies the fine, perfect, and holy human living of Christ, who through death offered Himself up to God, and whose living was offered up to God as a satisfying, fragrant offering. The peace offering typifies Christ&rsquo;s offering Himself up to make peace, that is, to reconcile man to God and God to man in order to become the enjoyment and satisfaction of God and man (Col. 1:20; Lev. 7:28-34). The sin offering signifies Christ being made sin on our behalf on the cross in order to deal with the indwelling sin in our nature (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3; 7:20). The trespass offering signifies Christ&rsquo;s bearing all our transgressions before God in order to deal with our sinful deeds (1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Birds for the Cleansing of a Leper</h2>
<p>Our sins cause us not only to have a record of sins before God, but they also defile us. Once we sin, we are defiled like lepers and cannot draw near to God. Thus, in Leviticus 14 God speaks of the cleansing of a leper to typify how He cleanses sinners. In this record one bird was slaughtered, and its blood was sprinkled on a leper to indicate Christ&rsquo;s dying for us to remove our sinful defilement. The second bird was let loose into an open field to indicate Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, which releases us redeemed sinners from our weaknesses by the power of His resurrection life (vv. 1-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Male Goats for the Day of Expiation</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 16, the two male goats for the Day of Expiation further portray the redemption that Christ accomplished for us (vv. 5, 7-10, 15-22). According to verse 8, Aaron cast lots on the two goats: one lot for Jehovah and the other lot for Azazel. Aaron then presented the goat on which Jehovah&rsquo;s lot fell as a sin offering (v. 9). He brought its blood inside the veil, sprinkled it upon the expiation cover and on the altar seven times (vv. 15, 19). The goat on which Azazel&rsquo;s lot fell, however, was sent away for Azazel into the wilderness (v. 10).</p>
<p>The first goat typifies Christ being slain for our sins. His blood was brought into the heavens and sprinkled before God (signified by the blood sprinkled on the expiation cover) to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that God could forgive us of our sins. His blood was sprinkled also on the cross (signified by the blood sprinkled on the altar) so that we may have peace in our heart, knowing that our sins have been forgiven. The second goat indicates Christ, through the efficacy of the cross, sending sin itself away from us back to Satan, signified by Azazel. Christ&rsquo;s death and the blood He shed on the cross brought us forgiveness of sins before God (Heb. 9:22), purified us from the defilement of sin in our conscience (v. 14), and sent sin itself away from us to the author of sin, the source of sin, Satan (John 1:29; Heb. 9:26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ashes of the Red Heifer</h2>
<p>In Numbers 19 the eternal efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption can be seen in the type of the ashes of the red heifer. The red heifer that was slaughtered and burned typifies Christ&rsquo;s being slain (vv. 2-3, 5). The ashes of the red heifer typify the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and these ashes were added into the water for impurity, which was then sprinkled on the unclean so that they might be cleansed (v. 9); this typifies the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which continuously cleanses defiled sinners by the living water of life in order to restore their fellowship with God (1 John 1:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption not only takes away our sins so that we may draw near to God but also enlivens our sin-deadened spirit. This is typified in the account of the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:4-9. In chapter 21 the children of Israel had sinned, and they were bitten and poisoned by deadly serpents. This speaks of man sinning and of his being poisoned with deadly sins by the ancient serpent (1 Cor. 15:55-56; Rev. 12:9), the devil. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpents that bit the children of Israel but not their poison; it was set on a pole as a curse and judged on behalf of the children of Israel (Deut. 21:22-23). This typifies Christ, who was sent &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3) but who &ldquo;did not know sin&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21). Furthermore, &ldquo;on the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24), that is, on the cross, He was &ldquo;made sin on our behalf&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21) and became &ldquo;a curse on our behalf&rdquo; (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>In Numbers 21 Moses represents the law, and bronze signifies judgment. Moses&rsquo; setting the bronze serpent on a pole signifies the law&rsquo;s judgment of Christ on the cross. All the children of Israel who were bitten by serpents lived when they looked at the bronze serpent. This signifies that everyone who has sinned and should die can have God&rsquo;s eternal life and be regenerated when they look at Christ, who was lifted up on the cross, and believe (John 3:14-15). When the bronze serpent was judged on behalf of the children of Israel, it also resulted in judgment upon the poisonous biting serpents. Similarly, Christ&rsquo;s judgment on the cross on our behalf also judged the seducing, corrupting, and incriminating Satan as well (12:31-32; 16:11). Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross not only took away man&rsquo;s sins and regenerated man; it also judged and destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>We have briefly explained the types in the Old Testament related to God&rsquo;s mysterious redemption, which serve as a blueprint of the mysterious and glorious redemption that our wise Designer planned in eternity. If we consider this blueprint along with the prophecies concerning Christ, we will be even clearer. Before His redemption was manifested, God presented His plan of redemption to man through prophecies and types. Then at the appropriate time He accomplished His redemption according to these prophecies and types.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
