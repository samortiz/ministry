   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE AS PRIESTS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SERVING ONES, AND SLAVES Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1, 7, 11; 1 Cor 12:28</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to fellowship concerning the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament the word deacon is an anglicized Greek word meaning a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A deacon is just a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The basic thought of this word in Greek is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the English language the word service has a very common usage and denotes something very general.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, in Romans 12 there are three verses that mention the word service or serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 1 says that if you present your body as a living sacrifice to God, this is your most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, verse 7 says that if you are in the service, just occupy yourself in service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Greek word for service is not the same word as in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another word for service is found in verse 11 which says, Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because all three words in English are the same, it is difficult for English readers to gain a proper understanding of these three kinds of service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The service in verse 1 is not a common, ordinary thing but a kind of priestly service, a kind of service in the worship of God, the service of a priest Rom 1:9; Matt 4:10; 2 Tim 1:3; Phil 3:3; Luke 2:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, in Matthew 4:10 the Lord told the devil, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word serve here is the duty of a priest, rendering service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THREE KINDS OF SERVICES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the teaching of the New Testament, there are three kinds of services from different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first service is from a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To present our bodies a living sacrifice is surely the work, the service, of the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So Romans 12 firstly considers us all as New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Apostle Paul was writing and talking with a group of persons who were priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second time the word service appears in Romans 12 is in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here the word service in Greek is based upon the word deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the deacon s service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether you are a teacher, teaching people for God or a prophet speaking God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into people, you are a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the word ministry in Greek is exactly the same as service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word serve or service in the New Testament has often been translated as minister, ministering, or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So first we are all priests and then serving ones, serving both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, in verse 11 the word service is used in a verbal form and is based upon the word slave.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So it says, Serving the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We carry out the Lord s service as three kinds of persons, a priest, a deacon that is, a serving one , and a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should serve as a priest first.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do mean business to serve as a priest, we have to serve as a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we really intend to serve as a deacon, we must consider ourselves as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to realize that all of us are slaves, not merely the servants, or serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the American government the elected officials are considered public servants, but I do not believe that any of them, even the President, would consider that they are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we have three statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, we are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, we are the serving ones, the deacons and deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, we are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be priests may be something quite honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we must humble ourselves to be serving ones, even slaves.</S>
