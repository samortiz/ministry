   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN ORDER TO HAVE A TEACHING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONE NEEDING TO KNOW GOD AND GOD S WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND TO HAVE A PROPER BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to be prophets, we must have a foundation in God s word; without a foundation in God s word, it will be difficult for us to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, our person must be right; if our person is not right, it will be futile even if we can prophesy well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prophets need the revelations in God s word, and the teachers who present a teaching also need the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was newly saved, I was desirous of the truth and tried my best to find books to read.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, I was a poor student and did not have much money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, I did not live in a big city, so not many books were available; nevertheless, I still did my best to buy books.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I first began to read, I did not have much discernment, and I thought that all the books were good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I read one book that expounded the matter of the leaven in Matthew 13:33.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse says that leaven was hidden in three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book explained that leaven is the power of the gospel that motivates the democratic nation and society.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I first read this, I felt that it was a good exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, however, as I joined the meetings of the Brethren assembly, heard their expositions, and read their books, I began to realize that the mention of leaven throughout the entire Bible, whether in the Old Testament or in the New Testament, is always related to something evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, it signifies evil; second, it signifies corrupted things, because of the germs within the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This exposition has its scriptural basis in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After keeping the Feast of the Passover, the children of Israel kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread in which they ate unleavened bread Exo 23:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus also spoke regarding leaven, saying, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees Matt 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After learning the correct interpretation of leaven, I abhorred the harmful books that I had read.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For them to cheat me of my money is a matter of little consequence, but it is a serious thing for them to deceive my mind and rob my energy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not easy to be a good teacher and to expound the teachings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, not everyone can expound the Bible, because the Bible is not an ordinary book to be read and understood by anyone according to his own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible has its principles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, in order to speak for God, we need to see the revelations contained in the Bible; then when we teach people, we must take God s riches as the content and reality in our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only in this way can people touch God and receive God s riches in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we need to instruct people concerning the ordinances, principles, and statutes in God s Word; this will constitute a good prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 103:7 says, He made His ways known to Moses; / His acts, to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that for a teacher to apply God s word, he needs to know God and God s ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only then can his speaking minister God to others, open their eyes, and cause them to know the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s ways are the laws, the principles, by which God acts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, we know that God is righteous and that He never does things that are unrighteous; this is a law, a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we want to help people to see this principle of God, we should never do anything that wrongs another person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when we ourselves have come to know the ways of God will we be able to teach them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, a person who teaches and preaches must enjoy God and know both God and God s ways.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Obtaining a basic constitution of the truth does not come simply by linking together a few verses in the Bible prior to coming to the meeting; it does not come so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prophesying and teaching require us to be persons who know God, enjoy God, and know God s ways, God s rules, and God s principles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must familiarize ourselves with the stories in the Old Testament so that in these stories we may see God and God s ways and thus be able to derive messages from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then when we speak, we will enable others to realize that God is full of lovingkindness, full of forgiveness, and abounding in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, we speak forth God and speak God into others for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Genuine teachings come from our labor in God s word; nevertheless, this differs from studying hard in school as a student.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not matter whether the being of a student studying in school is right or not; his results will be fine as long as he studies hard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The school cannot determine that because a student is a thief, he will not do well academically, nor can it expect that because another student is a modest gentleman, he will obtain a perfect score on his exam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The score one obtains on an examination depends upon how much effort one puts in. Even if a student is a thief, as long as he spends time to study hard before an examination, he will be able to earn a good score.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In contrast, if a person both steals and spends time studying God s word, he absolutely will not obtain a perfect score, because his person is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His person disqualifies him from speaking concerning God s ways, because God s ways are righteous and therefore will not permit any stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, when we speak for God, our person must be right.</S>
