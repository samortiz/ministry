   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE RESULT OF ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 6, 10, 16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 16:13-15; 17:1-2, 12, 14, 17-18, 20-24 THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the opening chapter it tells us that the Word of God came to be the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word was made flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even the tabernacle is the subject and focus of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a One was full of grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first chapter there is also the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can say this based upon verse 29, which says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where did the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that this was at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the following cases from chapter two through chapter twelve there are all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter three with the case of Nicodemus, there is the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter four with the case of the Samaritan woman, there is the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapters six and seven, there are the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter twelve there is the love feast, the feast of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those disciples and the Lord Jesus who were together in that house enjoying the feast were enjoying the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>WASHING OF THE LAVER</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It might seem that these dear ones were ready to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They had enjoyed the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems that they were ready and qualified to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet according to the typology in the Old Testament, before entering into the tabernacle, you need the washing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You need to go to the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why in chapter thirteen there is the washing of feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After all the offerings are covered in the first twelve chapters, there is a laver in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At first Peter rejected the foot-washing, but once he understood, he told the Lord to wash his whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord told him, He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean v. 10 . This is the function of the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Exodus 30:17-21 the laver is for washing the hands and the feet to prepare you to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FATHER S HOUSE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TABERNACLE THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After chapter thirteen covers the matter of the washing of the feet, the Lord Jesus began his most mysterious speech composed of three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He opened by telling his disciples: In My Father s house are many abodes 14:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to realize My Father s house is just the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to forget about your traditional inheritance that told you My Father s house was a big heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This term My Father s house is used twice in the Gospel of John, once in chapter two and once in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2:16 it is so clear that My Father s house refers to the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It should also be the same in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could the same term by the same writer in the same book after twelve chapters change in its meaning?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The change was not with the writer, but with all the traditional teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have taught the Bible according to their traditional concept, not according to the Word itself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even I myself was not so clear about this portion of the Word until 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While I was staying in an honorable guest house in London I was considering John 14, and the light came.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By going back to chapter two you can be clear that the Father s house is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chapter two the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they destroyed this temple, He would rebuild it within three days.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was, of course, referring to His physical body which was the tabernacle and the temple of God, even the Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They would destroy this temple by crucifying Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet in three days He would be raised up again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The raised-up house of the Father becomes the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The raised-up house becomes Christ and all His believers as His members.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So in the Epistles we are told that the church is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 , and we are told that the church corporately is the temple Eph 2:21 .</S>
