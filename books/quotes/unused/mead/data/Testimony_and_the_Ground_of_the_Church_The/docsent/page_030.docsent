   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Scriptures Allowing Us to Have</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Doctrinal Differences but Not Permitting Us to Be Sectarian, Divisive, because of Such Differences</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of the divisions of the church exist only because of different views that the believers have concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certainly, the truth is absolute, but the Scriptures allow for different doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Scriptures absolutely do not permit us to divide over our different doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 1:10-13 and Titus 3:10 show that to be sectarian, to be divisive, is absolutely condemned by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible allows us to keep this day or to keep that day, but the Bible does not permit us to divide over our different concepts concerning the keeping of days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may have a different view concerning the truth, but we cannot be divided from others because of our view.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must bear with those whose views are different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if we feel that it is proper to be baptized by immersion and to be quiet, we should bear with those who are for sprinkling and swaying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church should not be divided because of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These things are not the basic faith; these are simply our views concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be the children of God, to keep the oneness of the church, we need to tolerate these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our heart should be enlarged; it has to be as large as the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God does not require us to have the same doctrinal concepts; God requires us only to have the one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we do is acceptable, whether it is done one way or another way, as long as we have the one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should never divide from others over doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible absolutely does not permit us to be divided because of doctrines, even the best doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, this does not mean that there is not an accurate understanding regarding a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is an accurate understanding of the truth regarding baptism, regarding the Lord s Day, and even regarding all other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning these matters, the apostles have given us complete and precise teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But while they were accurate and serious in teaching, they were tolerant and broad in attitude and practice, not requiring uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On these matters, even when the believers practiced differently from what the apostles taught, the apostles said they must be allowed to practice in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the apostles absolutely would not allow for the formation of sects and divisions related to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They absolutely insisted that the church could not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we also must insist on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Truth involves accuracy, but many different views concerning the truth must be tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There should not be any division because of different views regarding the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We absolutely must avoid division.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is a undividable entity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. Dividing Because of Racial Differences</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are also divisions because of racial differences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Corinthians 12:13 the apostle says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks...</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to their natural life, these two races cannot be one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greeks absolutely could not be one with the Jews, and the Jews considered Gentiles as swine and dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The differences between them were very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But once they came into the church, they could not be divided because of these differences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we should not be divided into a white church, a black church, or a yellow church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These divisions are unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Christ, these distinctions in the flesh have been annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, when different races of people meet together in a church, they have different backgrounds, customs, dispositions, languages, and thoughts and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not an easy matter; this is a severe test for people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, the Lord does not permit division.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even divisions because of racial differences are not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>F. Dividing Because of Differences in Nationality</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another great source of division is related to differences in nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Episcopalian Church in England is called the Anglican Church, the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is also a Chinese Christian Church in China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are examples of divisions according to nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Divisions by races are not permitted by the Lord, and divisions by nationalities also are not permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are unacceptable 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is of the world and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>G. Dividing Because of Differences in Social Rank</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another unacceptable basis for division is divisions that come from differences in social rank 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church, both slaves and freemen are brothers and should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the early days, slaves had no position in society and no protection of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A master, once he bought a slave, could kill the slave at will and not be held accountable before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, distinctions in status were very great.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in the church there can be no such distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the church there are no distinctions based on social rank.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot associate only with highly educated ones because we are highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is a beautiful thing when one who is highly educated can sit together with an illiterate brother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The life of Christ is in both; hence, there should be no distinctions of social ranks.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Over twenty years ago in Shanghai there was a church of the rickshaw pullers, a church for those who pulled rickshaws.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the rickshaw pullers who were saved worshipped there.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is really wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no such distinction in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who ride the rickshaws and those who pull the rickshaws are brothers alike; hence, it is wrong to be divided because of social rank.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>H. Dividing Because of</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Spiritual Weakness or Mistakes</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The last kind of division is division because of certain spiritual weaknesses or mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Of the seven epistles written to the churches in chapters 2 and 3 of the book of Revelation, at least five of them contain rebukes regarding mistakes and weaknesses of the churches, but the Lord did not tell the believers to leave these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, the Lord called for overcomers in the churches who would supply and help others so that the churches would be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In summary, there is no basis in the entire New Testament for anyone to divide the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The church should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These things should not be only doctrines to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to consider whether or not we have a situation that causes us to be divided from the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God s children have been divided, and while we do not bear the responsibility for this, we must ask, Is there a divisive situation among us?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do we have opinions or proposals which cause us to be separated from others?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must remember that any reason for division is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We cannot justify any division.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should condemn all divisions among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to realize that it is sufficient for a person, through one faith and one baptism, to be joined to the Lord and God, and to be part of the church, which is the one Body, by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not need anything more than this, but anything less than this is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we have this, we have the oneness of the church and are in the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All that we require is the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>With the oneness of the church, we should let go of all our differences; we should not let any difference be a reason for division.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May the Lord give us grace!</S>
