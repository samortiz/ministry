[1]  TO THE PERFECTING TRAINING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16
[2]  These six verses from Ephesians 4 have a number of crucial points, but the focus of these crucial points is the perfecting of the saints.
[3]  The Perfecting Training is a definite work just to perfect the saints.
[4]  It has only one purpose, that is, the building up of the Body.
[5]  The Bible reveals to us that God s intention is to get the Body of Christ, the church.
[6]  When you went to pray, you had no spirit; when you came to the meeting, you had no spirit; when you tried to function, you had no spirit.
[7]  In the last message, we saw that there is a big eater within us eating the nourishment we receive from the Lord and hindering our growth in life.
[8]  No, culture is not the source of opinion; culture is the development of opinion.
[9]  Or you may say that culture is the cultivation of the source of opinion.
[10]  I would like to define opinion in this way: opinion is simply a person away from God.
[11]  You love the Lord, and you have seen the church, and you are for His recovery, yet you haven t seen that you are the embodiment of opinion.
[12]  Do you really believe that the Lord is in your spirit?
[13]  For quite a long period of time I have been trying to practice one thing.
[14]  Nearly every day I pray not once but several times that I would practice the one spirit with the Lord.
[15]  Brothers and sisters, you need to pick up this practice to practice the one spirit with the Lord.
[16]  Brother Lawrence practiced the presence of God, but we need to practice the one spirit with the Lord.
[17]  They used the Psalms very much, but the up-to-date light that we have received is not concerning the presence or the face of the Lord, but the Lord Himself as the Spirit being one with our spirit even that these two spirits are now one.
[18]  If you could have one and one-half hour out of the sixteen hours that you practice strictly the one spirit with the Lord, I believe, you must be very holy and very spiritual.
[19]  Surely you are not one spirit with Him when you quarrel, but even when you study the Bible or pray, you still may not be one spirit with the Lord.
[20]  In the last message we saw that our opinion is a big eater within us, hindering the growth of life, hindering our functioning, and frustrating the building up of the church.
[21]  We also saw that the source and development of opinion are just ourselves apart from God and away from God.
[22]  Although I have been with you for quite a number of years, I have never given you a message saying that opinion is just ourselves, our person, apart from God.
[23]  How good you are or how bad you are makes little difference; as long as you are apart from God, you are just the embodiment of opinion.
[24]  If you would just take this definition that opinion is just you apart from God and bring it to the Lord and stay with the Lord for some time, praying about this matter, you will sense the practical perfecting.
[25]  Now we need to spend more time on the healing.
[26]  The one spirit is the medicine, but we need to discover how to use this medicine.
[27]  You may have the medicine, but you also need to know how to use it.
[28]  If, however, you only know the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, yet you don t have the vision that God wants you to live Christ and to magnify Christ, you could not have a proper life.
[29]  If you want to apply this medicine of the one spirit, you need a vision to see that God doesn t want anything in you your opinion, your thought, your idea, your concept, your thinking He only wants Christ.
[30]  If you have seen the vision that Christ is everything to you, and you enjoy the Spirit coming to supply you, you will have the adequate experience.
[31]  We do worship You for all that You are to us.
[32]  When we realize that in the church life we should have nothing but Christ, and we give Christ the ground, the Spirit will come in to honor Christ and to kill everything else.
[33]  If I am offended when you do not call on the Lord after listening to my preaching, not only does it mean I have opinion, but also I have not seen a clear vision that Christ is everything in the church life.
[34]  If you could have no opinion concerning the small things in the church life because you realize that Christ is everything to the church life, this really means that you have no opinion.
[35]  Sometimes if you would pray and speak and minister in such a way to have Christ as everything according to the Spirit s leading, the Spirit will speak to others: You see, your brother has been meeting with you for some period of time, but he never expresses any kind of idea.
[36]  Although we have spent several messages on the matter of opinion, we need to consider once more, not doctrinally but practically, how we can have no opinion.
[37]  Second, you have to realize that Christ is everything in God s economy.
[38]  Christ is our life, Christ is our breath, Christ is our breathing.
[39]  You have to see that you cannot live without Christ.
[40]  If at any moment you and Christ are apart, you are dead.
[41]  Even though you have been regenerated, even though you have been strongly and thoroughly saved, you have to realize that once you are apart from Christ you are dead.
[42]  The Bible has over one thousand chapters, but you must realize the crucial point, the critical point, the organic point of the whole Bible is that you have to live by Christ.
[43]  If you have really seen these matters, every time you take anything other than Christ, there will be a kind of condemnation within you.
[44]  Also, whenever you live by yourself, you say something by yourself, you talk to other people by yourself, you do something by yourself, right away a condemnation is within you.
[45]  If you are humble, open, if you are poor in spirit with an attitude that you need the Lord s mercy, that you are nothing, you will get the light.
[46]  If you have seen that God only wants Christ and you have seen that God wants you to live by Christ, deep within you there is a kind of aspiration: Lord, I need You!
[47]  When you are filled in your spirit you will see that Christ is everything in God s economy and that you need to live Christ.
[48]  We have seen in previous meetings that our opinion is simply the embodiment of self.
[49]  We have also seen that opinion is a great hindrance to the growth in life and also to the proper functioning in the church life.
[50]  Doctrinally speaking we may say that we need the light, and we also need a kind of surgery.
[51]  When I am invited to any dinner, I only know how to eat; I don t know how to investigate.
[52]  Sometimes, however, I noticed that when a poor eater was invited to dinner, he didn t eat.
[53]  Now I feel that we have to go on a little deeper and a little further to touch a subtle thing that is within nearly all of us.
[54]  I do not believe that any among us could guess what it is.
[55]  In the Colossians Training we saw that the subtle thing that frustrates us from experiencing Christ is our culture, but you have to realize that culture is too general.
[56]  Every one among us is a character, and as a character we surely have some characteristic or characteristics.
[57]  But we have to realize this matter of peculiarity is much deeper than opinion.
[58]  I am still burdened about the matter of peculiarity.
[59]  I don t believe we can get through this matter quite easily.
[60]  What do you realize concerning the problem of peculiarity?
[61]  This is why we may be seeking year after year but have little growth.
[62]  I hope that these meetings may give you a real vision concerning your peculiarity.
[63]  I hope that you may realize you have a hidden problem.
[64]  I have been with many of you for years, and I fully realize that you are at a standstill because of your peculiarity.
[65]  Unless we see this vision we will become numb to the growth in life.
[66]  I have seen many who became numb to the growth in life.
[67]  But year after year you cannot see the addition of Christ in them.
[68]  Rather you have to lament that the territory of Christ in their life has been reduced and reduced and reduced.
[69]  At this point I would like to give a name to your peculiarity, and that name is antichrist.
[70]  Actually speaking, today Christ doesn t have much position and authority on the earth.
[71]  Second, you have to ask yourself who is there or what is there all the time that you don t live Christ.
[72]  Since you cannot say to me to live is Christ, you must say to me to live is my peculiarity.
[73]  If you are not living Christ, you must be living your peculiarity.
[74]  This is the case unless you are living sin or worldliness or the flesh.
[75]  But if you are living something that you cannot designate, that you cannot name, you have to realize that is peculiarity.
[76]  You cannot live Christ as long as you have your peculiarity, and you cannot have the proper Body life as long as you have your peculiarity.
[77]  I feel that through the past Friday night meetings we all have come to a very needy situation.
[78]  Of course I realize there are some younger ones among us.
[79]  They do have a heart, yet I have a deep sensation that according to the life procedure they haven t come up to a state that they really understand what we have been talking about these past few weeks.
[80]  Let me say something in a brief and clear way.
[81]  Because this one thing frustrates us from the experience of Christ and from the building up of the Body.
[82]  The pastoring of many pastors is not the real feeding, but a kind of organizing just to get a proper link with people.
[83]  If I go to you I must have a burden in life for you.
[84]  If you have been an elder in the local churches for at least five years, you will realize that among your brothers and sisters some have come to a certain stage that you cannot do anything to help them.
[85]  Whether you label it peculiarity or you label it the self, there is such a stronghold within you that all the time keeps you from Christ and from the building up of the Body.
[86]  In the first stage of our Christian experience sin and the world did hold us back from the experience of Christ, but not now.
[87]  Now the holding factor is not sin or the world but just this stronghold within you.
[88]  Whether you call it peculiarity or some other term makes little difference, but I do believe the proper term should be peculiarity.
[89]  For years we have realized that God s salvation is not to correct us.
[90]  You would even allow God to save you from your bad temper, but you would not allow Him to save you from your peculiarity.
[91]  Up to this point you have been saved from sin, from the world, and from so many other things, yet you do not live by this Christ.
[92]  Prayer: Lord, again tonight we are all sitting around You.
[93]  My burden is not to pass on some knowledge to you but to open up my whole being to you, hoping that you would open up your being to me and that we would all open ourselves to the Lord.
[94]  When I say we need the heart-to-heart fellowship and the spirit-with-spirit fellowship, I don t mean that you open up your inner secrets concerning your wife, your husband, your money matters, your college degrees, your future, and so forth.
[95]  In the Lord s recovery God s desire has been made more than clear to us.
[96]  We have seen God s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention.
[97]  We know that God wants us to live Christ that the Body may be built up.
[98]  But if you check your spiritual situation with the living of Christ and the building of the Body, you surely would not be satisfied.
[99]  Because we have seen the light in the recovery that God wants us to live Christ and to have the Body built up, I don t believe many among us would consider that they are spiritual.
[100]  In the Life-studies we have pointed out three books in the New Testament which reveal things either replacing Christ or opposing Christ.
[101]  The longer you stay in the church life, the more knowledge you pick up, the more attributes, qualities, and qualifications you have, the harder this peculiarity within you becomes in resisting Christ.
[102]  We all have to realize that in the Bible the kernel is Christ and His Body.
[103]  This is the reason that we consider these four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians as the heart of the divine revelation.
[104]  In no other book or books are Christ and His Body, the church, so thoroughly, adequately, and richly revealed to us.
[105]  He received a commission with a burden to complete the word of God, that is, to complete the divine revelation with these two mysteries: the mystery of God, Christ, and the mystery of Christ, the church.
[106]  Regardless of how much we are out of the world, regardless of how much we would not touch any sinful thing, regardless of how pious we are, how godly our Christian life is, and how much we are for the Lord and for His recovery, we have to admit that in our daily life Christ has not been lived out as much as He should be.
[107]  Although we may pray, we may pray-read, we may love the Lord, we may live outside of the world, we may not sin, we may be quite godly and pious, yet we have to check how much Christ is really there.
[108]  In no other book of the Bible is the writer so serious as Paul is in those four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.
[109]  When you read the book of Philippians you can especially realize that Paul was serious.
[110]  Now we need a little turn in the Perfecting Training.
[111]  I would like to ask two brothers to tell us their conclusion of the past messages concerning this ugly matter of peculiarity.
[112]  It seems to me, Brother Lee, that you ve been sharing very much on peculiarity, and at the same time you ve been sharing very much with us concerning living Christ.
[113]  God s redemption and transformation have this same goal.
[114]  Since 1963 I have given many messages on transformation, but I did not point out strongly that transformation is just to make us flexible to live God.
[115]  Transformation is not just to change us, but to make us flexible to live God.
[116]  However, we may get a lot of transformation, yet we still may not like to live God.
[117]  You may have condemned yourself that you didn t live Christ, but probably you have never condemned yourself that you live yourself.
[118]  If you would receive such a vision that you don t live Christ that much, you would condemn yourself.
[119]  According to the context of the verse which says that we need to pray unceasingly, we should not quench the Spirit.
[120]  It is not to pray unceasingly for your business affairs, for good food, for good blessings, for this, or for that.
[121]  Truthfully, you have to pray, Lord, send me twelve angels to remind me minute after minute that I have to exercise my spirit, that I have to live Christ, that I have to practice Christ.
[122]  We need to change the subject of the Perfecting Training from the matter of peculiarity to the matter of habit.
[123]  We need to see that we must build up a habit to live Christ.
[124]  For some time now I have been bothered that it is so hard to have a habit to live Christ.
[125]  Because you love Him you have been stirred up to seek how to live Him and to practice the one spirit with Him.
[126]  Colossians, a book on Christ, the Head, and Ephesians, a book on the Body, both end with the same charge.
[127]  Ephesians 6:18 says, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.
[128]  It doesn t mean whenever you pray you need to do these things; it means that at every time you need to pray; even every minute you have to pray.
[129]  Colossians, a book on Christ, also has a concluding charge.
[130]  Colossians 4:2 reads: Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving.
[131]  This means if you are going to experience Christ, it is not altogether adequate just to have the revelation in Colossians.
[132]  After receiving such a revelation of Christ, you have to pray and you have to persevere in prayer.
[133]  Perhaps when you were somewhere else in the past, you didn t have that much aspiration for prayer, but after you came into the Lord s recovery you began to aspire to pray.
[134]  We have now come definitely to a very crucial point, that is, for us to live Christ we must practice the one spirit with Him.
[135]  And for us to practice the one spirit with Him, we must exercise our spirit to pray unceasingly.
[136]  Now it is my turn to tell you what I have learned within this past week.
[137]  I practiced a lot this past week and through this practice I have been brought to a kind of understanding by the Lord, that is, that unceasing prayer is not just to pray before doing something.
[138]  According to our physical life we could understand and we could see a full illustration that to live is simply to breathe.
[139]  Now we need to discover what is our spiritual breathing.
[140]  I don t believe you can pray adequately without calling on the name of the Lord.
[141]  When I was a child we had a lot of three-legged races.
[142]  Two people had two legs tied together so that they had to coordinate as one.
[143]  You have to realize that today you and the Lord Jesus are bound together.
[144]  In the past few messages we have covered two main points concerning how to live Christ.
[145]  First, we pointed out that we have to pray before doing anything.
[146]  We know that the entire desire of the Triune God is to work Himself into you that you may live Him.
[147]  With a small wireless microphone there are two wires, the antenna and the ground wire.
[148]  We must be clear that any life matter doesn t depend so much upon knowledge.
[149]  You may know this and you may know that concerning the matter of life, but knowledge doesn t work out anything for the matter of life.
[150]  So regardless of how much we know concerning the spiritual life, if we are off from that life, it means nothing.
[151]  Through all the years in the Lord s recovery, the Lord has shown us that His intention is just to be our life that we may live Him.
[152]  You may have heard this for years, yet truthfully I must say that you haven t gotten into the habit to live Him.
[153]  Although you may realize many reasons which keep you and frustrate you from living Christ, it may be you haven t realized some of the reasons which are in the religious field.
[154]  Let me tell you also some of the experience of the Brethren.
[155]  At the end of the last century and the beginning of this century it may be that Andrew Murray was one of the top among the inner life people.
[156]  He put out a number of very helpful books in life such as The Spirit of Christ and The Holy of Holies, a study on Hebrews, and a number of other books.
[157]  But if you pay attention only to the cutting of the Word straightly and you don t care for the real experience of the living Christ, you will be trapped.
[158]  Just remember that our Triune God desires to be your life; He desires to live in you and with you; and He desires that you will just take Him as your life and live Him.
[159]  I would stress again that for us to realize and to touch the solid and concrete substance of the divine element, He gives us the Bible, the Word.
[160]  You must realize the Word is divine, and the Word is a very particular writing.
[161]  It is the condensation of the breathing of God.
[162]  This is why you don t need to exercise your mind, your mentality, so much.
[163]  Of course you need your mind, but you have to realize the Bible is not a kind of human, secular, worldly writing.
[164]  So you must love Him, and you must love His Word, not in a way of knowledge but in a seeking and living way.
[165]  Prayer: Thank You for Your mercy that we all have been brought into You into Your mercy.
[166]  In a good sense I have peace with the Lord, and I have a lot of enjoyment with Him, yet in another sense I have been bothered because I have discovered I don t live Christ that much.
[167]  But in the last few months I have been bothered for a further step, that is, how to live Christ.
[168]  No doubt while I have been so seeking, the Lord has answered His promise that if we seek we would find Matt 7:7 .
[169]  Recently I have told you that the first way to live Christ is that you have to pray before doing anything.
[170]  Second, I also discovered that you have to continue your prayer.
[171]  While you are doing certain things, you have to pray.
[172]  In the same way when you pray-read the Word, when you sing the Word, when you psalm the Word, and you thank God for the Word, you get the fresh air into your inner being.
[173]  In this meeting we need four brothers who will represent all the attendants and tell us three things: first, what real help have you received from the Perfecting Messages?
[174]  Second, in what aspect has your Christian life been improved by these messages?
[175]  Third, what kind of further help do you need, if anything?
[176]  First brother: To be honest I would say that the change in my life in the last ten months has been as significant as when I first came into the Lord s recovery.
[177]  When we began the Perfecting Training in January, we were in the midst of building our meeting hall, and the Lord was so faithful that I should experience an environment where He could definitely and directly touch me.
[178]  Almost every Christian is a kind of manager of Christ.
[179]  I don t use the word control or rule over, but the word manage.
[180]  If you are a worldly Christian, you would always direct Christ to go your worldly way.
[181]  When you criticize other brothers and sisters, you would direct Christ to go your way.
[182]  You direct Christ to take your way in reading the Bible; you direct Christ to take your way in prayer.
[183]  But when you are reading the Bible, when you are praying, when you are fellowshipping, when you are walking in the spirit, when you are living Christ, you dare to say that you live Christ.
[184]  And you have to realize that the more success you have in living Christ, the more you live Christ.
[185]  This is why even today the Lord has no way to come back.
[186]  Israel has been restored, and the city of Jerusalem has been returned to the hands of the Jews.
[187]  But if you look at the situation among Christians, there is nothing encouraging and nothing promising.
[188]  But when I asked you to tell us what you want, I didn t expect that any one of you would say that you want the church, the Body.
[189]  I expected you would say that you want to pray more, that you want to sing the Word, that you want this and you want that, and you want a lot of things.
[190]  On the one hand you love Him to the uttermost, and you seek after Him, but on the other hand you are bothering Him and you are frustrating Him because you are the boss.
[191]  We need to read Acts 2:40: And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
[192]  Do you believe this word, Save yourselves, is okay?
[193]  So you may consider that you like to live Christ and because you can t make it, you need to fast, and you need to pray.
[194]  Religion is that you and I would do something to please God.
[195]  One school is the Pentecostals who are too active.
[196]  Although God may have no intention to heal someone, they think if they fast and pray, eventually their fasting and prayer would heal this person.
[197]  Then from morning till evening you will be such a person telling the Lord that you love Him, that you want Him, that you surely would like to live Him, but that you wouldn t do it.
[198]  During the years of 1932, 1933, and 1934 I was seeking to abide in Christ.
[199]  By reading the Scriptures I realized that John 15 was a most crucial chapter.
[200]  Abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .
[201]  I believe all of you who have sought the Lord in that way can also testify that kind of seeking didn t work and that kind of prayer didn t work.
[202]  You have realized that you love the Lord, but you may have considered that you do not love Him so absolutely.
[203]  Tell the Lord that you love Him, that you want everything of Him, but that you would not do anything, that the Lord must do it.
[204]  When you turn to the Lord and begin to seek after Him for certain things, right away you become very active.
[205]  You would stay active for quite a long time.
[206]  You would be doing things and would be so diligent and so active.
[207]  You would consider that other people cannot pray so much, but you can.
[208]  If you do the things, you may get yourself into small traps, but if you don t do the things, you will remain in a bigger trap, so comparatively speaking, it is better to do it.
[209]  This Perfecting Training is not a church meeting for any kind of edification, nor is it a ministry meeting for some kind of teaching.
[210]  This is just an open fellowship with the seeking and experiencing saints.
[211]  Originally I had no intention to publish our talk here because I was concerned that these talks might be misused.
[212]  I don t want our talk to be used in a wrong way, in an immature way.
[213]  I am even concerned that some of you are not up to the maturity that these words are really for you.
[214]  For that word to help you, you must have a certain experience, a certain seeking after the Lord, and you must have experienced a lot of failures, a lot of defeats, a lot of disappointments, a lot of endeavor yet without result.
[215]  If you have experienced something, not just in your mentality, but in the real sphere of the spirit, then that word should have been precious to you.
[216]  Then you would ask, Is that good or bad?
[217]  I would say it is wonderful to be on fire; it is excellent; it is very good, but it may not be for you.
[218]  You have to realize that in seeking the Lord there is a narrow pathway, and once you pass through a certain stage of this narrow pathway, you have no way to get back.
[219]  You may consider that you are backslidden because ten years ago at Elden Hall you were having certain experiences, but you can never go back to that.
[220]  In the spiritual growth it is right to say that on the one hand you are growing, but on the other hand while you are growing, you are being reduced all the time.
[221]  If you don t have a certain kind of culture you will not have a certain kind of language.
[222]  The more you are growing, the more you will pray, the more you will read the Bible, the more you will have the church life, the more you will have fellowship, the more you will have many spiritual things.
[223]  By way of illustration, the Bible says we need to love one another.
[224]  You surely would like to love others so you begin to love.
[225]  Whether you can actually love or not makes no difference; it is you who are loving.
[226]  It will take you a long time to reach the point where you realize you don t need to love because the Lord lives in you.
[227]  You spend a lot of time to pray concerning your need to be more spiritual, concerning your need to live Christ, concerning your need to practice the one spirit with the Lord, concerning your need for impact, concerning your need for the inner life.
[228]  It is the same in the physical life with your children.
[229]  But if you are not able to do it, spontaneously there is no need for me to say don t do it.
[230]  According to my experience nothing pleases the Lord so much as for us to realize that He doesn t want us to do anything.
[231]  He only wants us to love Him, to open ourselves up to Him, and to let Him live from within us.
[232]  This may sound quite familiar to you, but if you look into such a sentence, you will realize it is not so common.
[233]  It is no wonder that among thousands of Christians you can hardly find one who knows that God doesn t want us either to know or to do; God only wants us to love Him and to keep ourselves open to Him.
[234]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE TOP REVELATION OF THE BIBLE
[235]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your move among us, and even for Your move within us.
[236]  Lord, we believe this recovery is Your testimony at the end of this age.
[237]  O Lord Jesus, in this dark age You have captured us, and You have put us together to come together all the time for Your Word.
[238]  First of all we have to realize that we redeemed sinners have all been made part of Christ s Body.
[239]  Also we have to realize that all the parts of Christ s Body are organic.
[240]  To be properly organic in the Body doesn t mean that you simply get baptized and that you get into a so-called church and then you become a member of the Body of Christ; rather it means you must be organically united with Christ.
[241]  Many Christians today teach about regeneration, but they never tell people that regeneration brings you into an organic union with Christ, making you a part of Christ.
[242]  If you read Ephesians and Colossians carefully, you could see that Ephesians tells us that the church is the fullness of Christ, the new man, the household of God, the commonwealth or the citizenship of God and the habitation of God.
[243]  Prayer: Lord, how we are grateful to You for Your mercy and grace!
[244]  The first is the station of justification, then sanctification, then the Body, and then the churches.
[245]  The Bible has a principle: every book in the Bible has a focal point which is supported by many verses.
[246]  These supports may be considered like the four legs supporting a table.
[247]  To find out the supports of a focal point in a certain book, you have to take care of the context of the entire book.
[248]  If you don t realize the organic union in Christ and you do not have your body offered, your soul transformed by the renewing of the mind, or your spirit burning, you are just outside of the Body and apart from the Body, practically speaking.
[249]  In this meeting, we need to touch another crucial point in Romans which is basically related to the Body of Christ.
[250]  Based upon this understanding, I want to ask a question: Besides the organic union, which is very much implied in this book concerning the Body of Christ, what is another vital item in Romans that has so much to do, not only with the Body of Christ, but also with the organic union?
[251]  Romans 8 also reveals to us what kind of reaction we should have toward such a Spirit.
[252]  We should walk according to the Spirit of life who is the Spirit of sonship.
[253]  You are walking according to Spirit, yet you discover while you are walking according to the Spirit, you would not be led by Him.
[254]  If I could take away this veil from you, you could see that many times while you are walking according to the Spirit, you would not be led by Him.
[255]  If you only walk according to the Spirit, yet you would not take the leading of the Spirit and be led by Him, you are short of the proper reaction to Him.
[256]  After this Paul goes on in the same chapter to show us that in our reaction to the spirit of sonship, there must be a kind of eager expectation.
[257]  This means that while you are walking according to Spirit and you are taking His leading to be led by Him, you realize that in your being you do not live like a son of God.
[258]  Within you there is a longing that you could live a life absolutely like the Son of God.
[259]  He uses all things working together for you to transform you and to change you from a son of Adam to a son of God.
[260]  We were not born sons of God; we were born sons of men, descendants of Adam.
[261]  In this message we will still be in the book of Romans for the Body of Christ.
[262]  So far, from the book of Romans we have picked up two main points: the organic union and the sonship for the Body of Christ.
[263]  But do you think your body is okay for you to present to the Lord?
[264]  When you talk about presenting your body in chapter twelve, you have to go back to see what kind of body you have.
[265]  God s commandment says that you should not be covetous, but when you try not to be covetous, something is within you weakening you.
[266]  Sometimes you may have told your wife you didn t have the time or you didn t have the energy to talk with her, but if you became angry with her you had sufficient energy to talk to her.
[267]  Chapter eight also mentions the body saying, For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live v. 13 . This indicates that all the practices of the body should be killed.
[268]  Chapter eight also has another good verse concerning the body: And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body v. 23 . Once you realize that your body is a body of sin and death, you would groan and you would earnestly expect for your body to be redeemed.
[269]  Some, realizing that their body needed to be dealt with, have practiced asceticism.
[270]  Asceticism is mainly to deal with this body of sin, of death, of bad practices in a severe way.
[271]  Actually, Paul did not say that our body needs to be put to death, but that the practices of our body need to be put to death.
[272]  Suppose a missionary goes to a mission field, yet he exchanges unpleasant words with his wife every day.
[273]  Do you think he is really employed by God?
[274]  Yet he is there working on the mission field for God.
[275]  He may present such a busy body to go to the mission field to do some mission work for God, but actually that is not a real service to God.
[276]  You can never enter into the Body life by presenting such a busy body to God.
[277]  When you offer such a body to God, this offering or this presentation may usher you into the Body life.
[278]  If you present a busy, employed body, you have no way to enter into the practicality of the Body of Christ.
[279]  By this you can see that although you say you walk according to the Spirit, actually you do not.
[280]  FOR THE BODY LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:7-14; 23
[281]  When your body is active, and you set your mind upon this acting body, that is, you put your thinking, you concentrate your thinking, upon this acting body, that is to put your mind on the flesh.
[282]  Finally, there is a hidden point in this verse.
[283]  This is implied in the last sentence: But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[284]  You have been saved and you have Christ in your spirit making your spirit life, but your body remains dead.
[285]  When you would let the Spirit of God make His home in your entire being, the divine life will saturate your body, making your body spiritual and making your body no more the flesh.
[286]  But it is not until this divine life in your spirit spreads into your body, saturating your body with the divine life, that you become not only a saved believer, but also saturated with God.
[287]  My burden is to point out to you that until you live in this way setting your mind upon the spirit and putting to death all the activities of your body you are not adequate for the Body of Christ.
[288]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST IN YOU MAKING A DISTINCTION
[289]  The first time life is mentioned in chapter eight is in verse 2: For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[290]  The third verse concerning life in Romans 8 is verse 10: And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[291]  You must be qualified with the Spirit indwelling you, and you must be qualified with Christ in you in order for the Spirit to give life to your mortal body.
[292]  In the last message I told you that if you are going to be in the spirit, you must have the Spirit of God dwelling in you, making His home in you, housing Himself in you.
[293]  But now I would tell you that you may have the Spirit housing Himself in you and yet still not have the distinction between your dead body and your spirit being life.
[294]  Eventually, there will be a distinction within you where you realize that your spirit is not only living, but it is life; yet your body is dead.
[295]  When you have this distinction, by experience you can know so clearly that your body is just a dead thing and your spirit is life.
[296]  Many of you have not yet entered into this experience, and although you can understand my speaking, I don t think you can apprehend the taste of this distinction.
[297]  Once again I would say that the very you in verse 11 who is the receiver of the divine life is a believer who is qualified with the Spirit indwelling him and with the distinction between the dead body and the spirit as life by Christ s presence.
[298]  Now we come to another point: What are the functions of this Spirit of life in His indwelling?
[299]  Romans 8 first reveals the Person of the Spirit; then it reveals the work of the Spirit.
[300]  It tells us who the Spirit is, and then it tells us what the Spirit is doing within us.
[301]  As to His Person, He is revealed first as the Spirit of something, and then He is revealed as being the Spirit of two Persons.
[302]  Chapter eight tells us that this Spirit of life is God the Spirit or the Spirit of God v. 9 . The chapter goes on to tell us that this Spirit of life who is the Spirit of God is also the Spirit of Christ.
[303]  When He houses Himself in you, God is in you, Jesus is in you, and the resurrected Christ is in you.
[304]  Now we come to the second point, that is, the work of the Spirit.
[305]  The Spirit is the instrument through which God imparts life into our mortal body, even into our whole being.
[306]  The Spirit is the instrument through which we put to death the practices of our body, and the Spirit is the One who directly leads us as sons of God.
[307]  Now we have to ask what is the way that the Spirit works out these three points.
[308]  God is now imparting His zoe life into our dead body through the Spirit, and we have to slay the practices of our body by the Spirit, and this Spirit, through whom God imparts life to our dead body and by whom we slay the deeds of our body, is leading us.
[309]  The work of the indwelling Spirit is of three categories: to impart life to our mortal body, to slay the practices of our body, and to lead us.
[310]  You have to realize, though, that of these three times the Spirit was the instrument for the work twice.
[311]  Rather he said, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God v. 14 . He leads you, yet it depends upon whether you are willing to be led.
[312]  Rather he says, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you v. 11 . Nor does he say that the Spirit kills the practices of our dead body.
[313]  Rather he says, If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live v. 13 . Why does Paul write in this way? Based upon doctrine alone, you have no way to explain.
[314]  Let me explain it in this way: Yes, it is the indwelling Spirit working in you, but suppose you don t contact God.
[315]  The Spirit is the Spirit of life, but don t forget this life-working Spirit is the Spirit of God.
[316]  God may be imparting life to you while you are fellowshipping with Him, yet if you wouldn t slay the practices of your body, nothing will happen.
[317]  Whether God is really imparting life into you or not and whether you are really slaying the practices of your body or not depends upon whether you are willing to be led by the Spirit.
[318]  What is the issue of the indwelling Spirit working in us in these three categories?
[319]  Not until you experience the indwelling Christ imparting life to your deadened body, putting the practices of your body to death, and leading you, will you enjoy the real experience of the firstfruit of the Spirit.
[320]  We all have the Spirit indwelling us, but not many do have the practical and actual enjoyment of the firstfruit of the Spirit.
[321]  Only when God is actually imparting His divine life into your deadened body by His indwelling Spirit, and when you cooperate with God in putting to death the practices of your dead body by this indwelling Spirit, and when you are willing to be led by this indwelling Spirit, will you have the experience of the firstfruit of the Spirit.
[322]  At that point you will realize you still have such a body, dragging you away, pulling you off, distracting and bothering you.
[323]  On the contrary, the Concordant Version renders both spirits with a small letter s. Why do we dare to say that in the same verse the first spirit denotes our spirit and the second spirit denotes God the Spirit? If you were to ask me, I don t have much boldness to say, but I just understand it should be like this.
[324]  Many versions have rendered the spirit here with a capital S. I oppose this very much because in the New Testament you do have a contrast between the flesh and the Holy Spirit, but you cannot have a contrast between our body and the Holy Spirit.
[325]  Why in Romans 8, while Paul is talking about the Spirit, does he suddenly say the Spirit of Christ?
[326]  This means he indicates strongly that the very Spirit he is talking about is Christ.
[327]  And Christ is not so simple as what is in your understanding.
[328]  This Person, this Spirit of Christ has first regenerated you, putting His life and His nature and His element into your spirit, making your spirit one with Him.
[329]  It means that when you are behaving, acting, moving, and living according to the Spirit, to the mingled spirit, to the indwelling of the Spirit then you are actually moving, living, behaving in the Body of Christ.
[330]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE OUR COOPERATION AND GOD S OPERATION
[331]  Have you ever spent some time in Romans 8 to find out how many activities there are on God s side and how many activities there are on our side?
[332]  Actually, this chapter does not stress how much God does, but rather it stresses how much we do.
[333]  We need to consider some of the problems in Romans 8, but first we must spend some time to lay a foundation so that we may be enabled or qualified not to solve the problem, but at least to understand the problem.
[334]  The first point is that we have to walk according to spirit.
[335]  This walking according to spirit is on our side; actually, this is our switching on.
[336]  When we walk according to spirit, we switch on and the law works.
[337]  The third item of our doing in this chapter is to put to death the practices of our mortal body v. 13 . The fourth item is to be led by the Spirit of God v. 14 . According to our natural concept, we always consider that this is a verse concerning the spiritual leading.
[338]  Now we need to spend a little time to see these seven doings.
[339]  I am so thankful to Paul for putting these seven things in a very good sequence.
[340]  Then all the time you would cry either, Lord Jesus! or Abba Father!
[341]  Whenever you would open your mouth to say something about the Spirit, the Spirit would witness with you.
[342]  Whenever you witness, He cooperates with you and confirms your witnessing.
[343]  Not only can you not divide Christ from the Spirit, but you also should not separate the Holy Spirit from your spirit.
[344]  Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to spirit.
[345]  It is not just according to the Holy Spirit nor just according to the human spirit.
[346]  By this you can see that few Christians today actually understand the Spirit s leading because they don t know they have a spirit.
[347]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW OF LIFE
[348]  In this message we are once again on Romans 8.
[349]  Yes, it is somewhat on the Spirit, but I don t believe that the main topic of this chapter is the Spirit.
[350]  Through the Life-studies on Exodus and other messages I believe you realize that the law of God is a testimony or a picture.
[351]  The law of God given on Mount Sinai was just a picture, a portrait, of God.
[352]  One of the biggest steps of the divine process is resurrection.
[353]  Here it mentions the Spirit of the Resurrector, not the Spirit of the Creator.
[354]  First, the chapter says, the Spirit of God ; then it says, the Spirit of Christ ; then it says, Christ in you.
[355]  HOW THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WORKS
[356]  The next question is this: How does this law work?
[357]  In this message, the burden is the function of the law of life or the scientific working of the law of life.
[358]  We have to see how the law of life works in a scientific way.
[359]  Now we need to discover from Romans 8 what are the elements within the law of the Spirit of life.
[360]  Verse 2 indicates that both the Spirit and life are components or elements or ingredients of this law.
[361]  For almost fifty years I have been serving and teaching the saints, but I am afraid that some of the help that I rendered to them was not so genuine.
[362]  The genuine help, the real help, is just to get the saints into the touch with the Lord that will let the automatic law work.
[363]  As the law of the Spirit of life works in such a one, it will reduce his problem and solve his problem and kill some of his germs.
[364]  The real help is to get into this touch with the Lord that will cause the automatic law of the Spirit of life to operate within us.
[365]  When your wife irritates you or provokes you, you won t need to gnash your teeth because that ugly thing within you has been reduced and eliminated.
[366]  In this message we have a high mountain to climb.
[367]  Let us read Romans 8:2: For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[368]  Now we come to the law of sin and of death.
[369]  I know what my commission is, and I fully admit that my teachings are different from traditional Christian teachings.
[370]  In Genesis 3 he entered into humanity, into mankind.
[371]  When you lie, do you need Satan s inspiration?
[372]  Or when you lie, do you need a demon to possess you?
[373]  Romans 8:3 is a verse which is difficult to translate and also difficult to understand.
[374]  For example, the New American Standard Bible reads: For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh.
[375]  Previously, I told you that all of chapter eight after verse 2 is a full definition of the law of the Spirit of life.
[376]  Have you noticed that in chapter eight these three terms of the Trinity are strongly mentioned?
[377]  Furthermore, in this chapter, there is the clear indication that this Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has passed through the process of incarnation, because the Son was sent in the form of the flesh v. 3 . This chapter also indicates or implies the crucifixion because it mentions Jesus being raised from among the dead v. 11 . This chapter also indicates resurrection because it speaks of the Spirit of the One who raised up Christ Jesus from among the dead v. 11 . Furthermore, this chapter includes ascension, because in verse 34 it mentions that the resurrected Christ is now on the right hand of God interceding for us.
[378]  Many Christians, on the other hand, believe in a God who is triune with three separate persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[379]  Actually, eventually, ultimately, and consummately they believe in three Gods.
[380]  Let us consider the verses concerning the law of sin and of death in Romans 7.
[381]  Verse 21 reads, I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.
[382]  When I throw something into the air, I don t need to pray that God would send it back.
[383]  Furthermore, if you drop a book, and it falls to the earth, you shouldn t condemn Satan, saying that he took away your book.
[384]  We can see that there are two set up principles within us.
[385]  One is the evil principle set up in the members of this fallen body, in our flesh.
[386]  But the other is a wonderful, a good principle, set up in our spirit.
[387]  In the past few messages we have entered into several vital points.
[388]  The law of the Spirit of life has been installed into us.
[389]  This law is just the Triune God, who, after being processed and becoming the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit.
[390]  In a recent conference we had three messages telling us how that God is the positive law within us, and Satan is the negative law within us.
[391]  Although we are spending much time on Romans 8, and some of you are very familiar with this chapter, don t think we can exhaust it.
[392]  Have you noticed that Romans 8 doesn t seem to give us any definite instructions?
[393]  There is no instruction but a kind of description.
[394]  To say, There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, is not an instruction; this is a description.
[395]  In verses 3 and 4 God has passed through the processes so that there can be an issue that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk according to spirit.
[396]  To cooperate with this law is to walk according to spirit and to walk according to spirit is the way to cooperate with this working law.
[397]  The law has been installed, but the law s function and the law s operation needs your cooperation.
[398]  You may be able to say that your reading of a newspaper or your shopping or your writing of some letters is according to spirit, but probably you cannot say that your being, your entire being, is according to the spirit.
[399]  In the last message we saw that the proper walk according to spirit must be that we ourselves are according to spirit.
[400]  Our walking must be according to our being, and our being is according to spirit.
[401]  For example, I am going to talk to my wife or to buy something or to speak to some of the saints, so I have to remind myself that I need to speak according to spirit.
[402]  Now we need to consider how we can be according to spirit.
[403]  Although I don t like the phrase, how to, I have to use it.
[404]  There is no human spirit, no Spirit of God, no Spirit of life, no Spirit of Christ, no indwelling Spirit, no witnessing Spirit, no leading Spirit, no Spirit of the firstfruit.
[405]  To be according to spirit is to mind the things of the Spirit.
[406]  First, we need to consider what are the things of the spirit.
[407]  Many items are included in the things of the spirit: God, Christ, the Spirit, the Triune God, all the processes that the Triune God went through, the church, all the things the Triune God has accomplished, all your Christian experiences.
[408]  If you were to mind all these things minute after minute, when you go shopping you surely would not buy clothes that are according to the fashion of this world.
[409]  If you are minding all these things of the spirit, you become a person according to spirit.
[410]  Prayer: Lord, how we worship You as the Triune God, the very processed God.
[411]  We thank You that You have gone through so many processes, and You have achieved so much, making Yourself even a law within us the law of the Spirit of life.
[412]  Now we need to consider these matters in more detail.
[413]  What does it mean to mind the things of the Spirit?
[414]  In the same principle, the way to be in the spirit is to set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit.
[415]  When you are in the flesh, you are fleshly, or even fleshy.
[416]  When we call on the Lord s name, when we pray-read the Word, when we fellowship with the saints, when we attend the meetings, when we read the ministry, we get more color added to us.
[417]  And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; but He Who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.
[418]  Now we have to ask: Whose mind is this?
[419]  It is difficult to say, because now the Spirit is mingled with your spirit, and the Spirit here is interceding within you.
[420]  In our groaning, there is the groaning of the Spirit.
[421]  Even we can say that it is the Spirit s groaning groaned by us, uttered by us.
[422]  In the same principle, it is the Spirit s mind, but now the Spirit s mind is one with our mind, because our mind is set on the spirit.
[423]  Prayer: Lord, we do have a heart to seek after You and to seek after the living word.
[424]  I have ministered and taught that the flesh is enmity against God, that the flesh is not subject to the law of God, that there is no possibility with the flesh to be subject to the law of God, and that the flesh cannot please God.
[425]  Our spirit is no more just a natural spirit.
[426]  Regeneration means that God the Spirit indwells our spirit.
[427]  The natural spirit has no regeneration, but the mingled spirit means regeneration because a divine Spirit has entered into our original spirit.
[428]  If something is simply from your mind, after you pray and contact the Lord, you will sense right away that you shouldn t do it.
[429]  For example if you lose your temper, and you realize that you have lost your temper, and you turn to your spirit, that is too late.
[430]  When you feel that you are weak you have to condemn that and tell Satan that God has never given you such a spirit.
[431]  How we thank You that we are the redeemed people!
[432]  In verse 9 Paul says that the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[433]  He does not say that the Spirit of God is of you, or for you, or with you, or even merely in you.
[434]  So actually it could be translated that the Spirit of God houses in you.
[435]  We have already mentioned the significance of the prepositions of and in. What is the significance of the use of the different kinds of verbs? If I ask whether or not you have the Spirit of Christ you would answer that you do.
[436]  You don t need to say turn to the Spirit.
[437]  In the past we have had a slogan Turn to the Spirit.
[438]  When you start to lose your temper just an O Lord will keep you in your spirit.
[439]  Lord, we praise You for Your mercy, and we praise You even the more for Your grace.
[440]  Now we need to pay our attention to something further, that is, the change of the expression concerning the Spirit in verse 9.
[441]  Not only so, in verse 2, there is another interchangeable term concerning the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life.
[442]  Actually, the Spirit of life is the major term used by this chapter concerning the Spirit of God.
[443]  Let us come back to the first question: Why is the Spirit not mentioned, but Christ is mentioned?
[444]  In this verse Paul is emphasizing that today Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ in you is exactly the same as Christ in you.
[445]  In the past we have given a number of messages saying that these three titles the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are used interchangeably.
[446]  Although it is the Spirit who dwells in you, when you come to worship or to pray you would rarely say, O Spirit.
[447]  According to Romans five, six, seven, and eight, sin is nothing less than God s enemy, Satan.
[448]  If Satan were outside of us, he would have little to do with us, but we all know that since man s fall Satan entered into man.
[449]  And while you are arguing and doing these kind of defeated things, don t you have a kind of sensation within you that it is a shame for you to say that you love the Lord?
[450]  The body is dead has a factor, and the spirit is life has a factor also.
[451]  There is a reason that the body is dead, and there is a reason that the spirit is life.
[452]  This means that God made Christ sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him, that is, in Christ.
[453]  In this message we come to Romans 8:10 once again: And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[454]  According to what we covered in the last message, this verse has three facts: Christ is in us, our body is dead, and our spirit is life.
[455]  Regardless of what the scientists and scholars have found out scientifically concerning man, they are much inferior to Paul because they don t know the things of man as Paul did.
[456]  But Paul not only tells you how you can be forgiven, but how you can be justified and sanctified, and even how your body can be redeemed in the future.
[457]  Paul pointed out so many of the things of man in the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians, and then he said you have to exercise your spirit to know these things v. 11 . For Confucius to say that if you offend the heavens you have no way to be forgiven indicates that he didn t really know the real things of man.
[458]  In order for you to know the things of man mentioned in Romans 8:10, I would encourage you to exercise your spirit and even to trust in the Spirit of God.
[459]  This one verse nearly covers all the things of man and all the things of God.
[460]  I wouldn t say that it covers entirely the things of man and the things of God, but I would say it nearly covers all the things of man and all the things of God.
[461]  Now we come to the history of our spirit.
[462]  Of course, man s spirit was also firstly created by God, yet after man s fall, his spirit became deadened and lost its spiritual function toward God.
[463]  One crucial hint in the Bible concerning the human spirit has been missed by nearly all the Christians.
[464]  If you read the Bible carefully with your experience of the spiritual life, you could realize that even after the fall of man, God preserved man s spirit.
[465]  Man s spirit was not only created by God, but also it has been preserved by God.
[466]  The strange thing is this: we receive Him as our Savior, but He comes in as the Spirit.
[467]  But when Christ as the Spirit enters into your spirit, righteousness is within you all the time making you so right with God and all the time restituting you.
[468]  CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR LIVING CHRIST BY REMAINING IN THE SPIRIT
[469]  Prayer: Lord, You know how much we need You.
[470]  We need You so that we can live You.
[471]  Even tonight we need You so that we can understand You.
[472]  Thank You, Lord, You are not only our life, but also our person.
[473]  Lord, we do have You as our person living in us and with us as one.
[474]  Why then in Romans 8:3-9 does Paul use the word flesh, but when he comes to verse 10, change the expression from flesh to the body?
[475]  It is because in verse 10 Paul intends to imply the history of the body.
[476]  Just to say the flesh is dead does not imply a history, but to say the body is dead implies a kind of history.
[477]  In like manner you would not say that the flesh is fallen, but you have to say that the body is fallen.
[478]  If you were to change the word body to flesh and read the verse in this way: And if Christ is in you, though the flesh is dead because of sin, yet the Spirit is life because of righteousness, it might be okay.
[479]  We were created by God, we got fallen, we have been saved, and now we have Christ living in us!
[480]  Some today would oppose the fact that Christ is in us.
[481]  They say this is to make Christ too small.
[482]  They ask how such a great and unlimited Christ could get into you.
[483]  This is why Romans 8 first says walk according to the spirit v. 4 . Then it says to mind or consider the things of the spirit v. 5 . Verse 6 says that you have to set your mind on the spirit, and verse 9 says you have to be a person in the spirit.
[484]  Verse 11 reads, But if the Spirit of the One Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.
[485]  When you come to verse 13, however, the pronoun changes to you: For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.
[486]  Now we need to spend more time to see some of the crucial points in verses 9 through 13.
[487]  The first crucial matter in these verses is the indwelling or the residing Spirit.
[488]  Verse 9 reads, But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[489]  But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[490]  When Paul says the Spirit of the One Who raised Jesus, he indicates that the One who raised and the Jesus who was raised both are one with the Spirit.
[491]  The Spirit who resides in you doesn t reside in you just by Himself.
[492]  He resides in you with the One who raised and with the One who was raised.
[493]  When you have the residing One you also have the Father and the Son.
[494]  When you have the residing One you have the ultimate expression of the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[495]  And you are short of the putting to death because you don t realize that the Spirit residing in you today is a composition of the raising One and of the One raised up.
[496]  In chapter eight of Romans, several things are quite crucial to our experience.
[497]  The first crucial thing as far as our experience is concerned is the matter of walking according to spirit.
[498]  While the Spirit of God is residing in you, He is not dormant or sleepy or silent or passive.
[499]  He is very active, not in exercising some gift or in doing a miracle, but in living.
[500]  His residing in you actually means His living in you.
[501]  As long as you take care of these three matters, you are clear about everything, whether it is what kind of car you should buy, whom you should marry, or what kind of shoes you should buy.
[502]  If you have the residing of the Spirit in you plus God s giving life plus your putting to death, you will be clear in everything.
[503]  Only through experience could we realize that the leading of the Spirit of God in verse 14 is the totality of the Spirit s residing within us, God s life giving through Him, and our putting to death through Him.
[504]  The Christian life is not a story of a single person.
[505]  The Christian life is a story of two persons living together.
[506]  In past messages we have covered the first thirteen verses of Romans 8, and now we come to verse 14.
[507]  In this verse two things are covered: one is the matter of leading, and the other is the matter of sonship.
[508]  For example, there is the law of the Spirit of life; there is the walking according to the spirit; there is the setting of the mind upon the spirit; there is the residing of the Spirit of God; there is God s life giving; and there is the putting to death the practices of our mortal body.
[509]  Now we need to consider why in verse 14 this thought of being led by the Spirit of God is brought in. We need to discover what particular point or points indicate that this portion of the Word will bring us to the matter of the leading of the Spirit of God.
[510]  If you get into the depths of God s residing in us and of God giving life to us and our putting to death, you could see that the leading of the Spirit is there.
[511]  As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
[512]  When we speak of God s life, we understand it in a very general way.
[513]  We don t realize that God s life given to us now becomes our life.
[514]  The life mentioned in Romans 8 implies a lot.
[515]  Verse 14 indicates that the matter of leading is here just because we are sons of God living a life under such a lead.
[516]  If you are led by such a leading you are living the life of sons of God.
[517]  In this message we need to consider what are the constituents of the leading of the Spirit.
[518]  We have to find out what the leading of the Spirit of God is composed with.
[519]  Verse 14 may be considered as a conclusion of the preceding thirteen verses.
[520]  So verse 14 begins with the little word for to indicate that something has preceded it.
[521]  These three elements the law, the Spirit, and the life are the very constituents that constitute the leading of the Spirit.
[522]  This divine Person is the Spirit, and this Spirit bears or carries two things: the law and the life.
[523]  So there is such a term: the law of the Spirit of life.
[524]  The leading concerning what you should say to people, where you should go, what kind of people you should contact, how you should respect and honor your parents is already within you.
[525]  CHAPTER FORTY-NINE KNOWING THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT
[526]  Have you noticed that Romans 8 doesn t charge us to seek after the leading of the Spirit?
[527]  But if you come to Romans 8 with anything you have picked up, you can never enter into it.
[528]  If you want to enter into Romans 8 and touch its depths, you must be so pure, so clean, and so simple.
[529]  Although you may consider that you are clear concerning the components of the leading of the Spirit, I would ask whether you have walked and lived according to these three things.
[530]  Whether you feel you have these three, or you don t feel you have these three things, they are in you.
[531]  Your reading of the Bible, your prayer, and your waiting are all the different steps of your making up a kind of leading.
[532]  Is this not a picture of your past Christian life?
[533]  For such a long time you built up a lot of leadings, but the genuine leading was mostly ignored.
[534]  In other words, even though we may have been seeking, studying the Bible, praying, waiting on the Lord, yet for so many years we didn t live a life as a son of God.
[535]  We may have lived a life that was much regulated and that was much improved, but it was not so much a life that designated us the sons of God.
[536]  We have to practice putting to death the practices of our mortal body.
[537]  You behave, you walk, you do things, you see things, you talk.
[538]  If we would know the leading of the Spirit, we must get through the point which we are going to cover in this message.
[539]  Because you are a child of God, you like to please God.
[540]  So you pray, asking God the Father to give you a leading that you may follow.
[541]  Now I would like to add a further word: this One who lives within us is not our roommate.
[542]  He has come to live within us, not to be our roommate but to replace us.
[543]  When we heard that the Lord Jesus lives within us or that the Spirit of Christ dwells in us, we may have considered that we would now have a roommate, a companion.
[544]  Suppose you are such a person: you have this One living within you to be your life, to be your nature, to be your everything, to replace you.
[545]  The genuine and trustworthy and proper leading is this kind of leading.
[546]  It is just the Triune God Himself in you to be your life, to be your nature, to be your everything.
[547]  When you look at Him He leads, and you are led.
[548]  When you are led in this way you know from within that you are living, that you are full of anointing, that you are refreshed, that you are watered, and that the light is within you.
[549]  In this message we need once more to look into the first fourteen verses of Romans 8.
[550]  As we have pointed out in the past, verse 14 is a conclusion of this portion of the Word.
[551]  We know that this concluding verse is mainly on one matter, that is, the leading by the Spirit of God.
[552]  If you will get into these negative items and even pray-read these negative items, you will see who you were and perhaps still are.
[553]  You will see in what condition and situation you were and still are.
[554]  You will realize and you will see your real being.
[555]  As long as you are even a little bit involved with these nine items of your natural situation, you are not under the leading by the Spirit.
[556]  Regardless of how much you think or feel that you are under the leading of God, you are actually outside of it.
[557]  You say that you have the Lord s leading to do this or to do that, but when you do that are you a debtor, or are you a released person?
[558]  Finally there is the matter of the sons of God.
[559]  To be a son of God means that we are full of life, that we are in maturity, that we are full of liberty, with no bondage, no debt.
[560]  Whenever you say that you have the leading of the Spirit, you have to check about the law of life, the Spirit of life, the divine life, and your Spirit mingled with God s Spirit of life.
[561]  The matter of the leading by the Spirit of God has been misunderstood by most Christians.
[562]  Recently I admired some wonderful testimonies concerning the leading by the Spirit of God, but at the same time I had the deep sensation that they were wrong.
[563]  The Lord s leading is not for outward business or activity; it is absolutely for our living.
[564]  If you pick up this kind of understanding, it will revolutionize your entire life.
[565]  I don t mean that we shouldn t have any arrangement for our schooling, or any kind of plan for our job, or any kind of plan for our business.
[566]  Our arrangements and our plans must be under the leading by the Spirit because we are persons who are altogether living under the leading by the Spirit.
[567]  It doesn t mean that since you have the best education, you would have a successful business and you would have the best future.
[568]  You must tell the Lord, Lord, thank You, You have chosen me, You have predestinated me, You have called me, You have saved me, You have regenerated me, You have brought me to this day, and You have preserved me.
[569]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your sovereign mercy that we can still meet in this hall tonight!
[570]  In the last message we pointed out that the matter of the leading by the Spirit is not mainly for certain matters, for business, for activities, or even for actions.
[571]  In other words, as long as your living is under the leading by the Spirit, then whatever you do as a kind of activity would spontaneously and simultaneously also be under the leading by the Spirit.
[572]  If you are a person living a life absolutely under the leading by the Spirit, where you go to school will also be under the leading by the Spirit.
[573]  You should not pay so much attention to your activities, to what school you should attend, to what job you have to take, to what house you have to rent or to buy.
[574]  As long as you pay your full attention to your living and live a life daily, moment by moment, under the leading by the Spirit you will be clear.
[575]  If you are right with such a living under the leading by the Spirit, whatever you say is under the leading by the Spirit.
[576]  The things of the flesh also are related to our living.
[577]  There are so many items related to the flesh because you are a person living in the flesh.
[578]  When you are a person living in the flesh, your clothing is of the flesh, your eating is of the flesh.
[579]  Whatever you do and whatever you have is of the flesh because you are just a person living in the flesh.
[580]  No doubt the law of the Spirit of life is for living.
[581]  God regenerated our spirit for us to live a life, not for us to be someone great.
[582]  If you don t have peace with God or with your wife or with your husband or with your neighbor or with people on the street or with your own thinking or your own emotion or your own love, that is a sign you are not under the leading by the Spirit.
[583]  If you are under the leading by the Spirit you have peace with God, with everyone, and with every matter.
[584]  If you don t have such a signal, peace within you in everything, you have to realize at that very moment you are not under the leading by the Spirit.
[585]  As Christians today we all have been very much influenced in our human culture by religion.
[586]  As long as you are a human being, born as a descendant of Adam and living on this earth, you are under the influence of religion.
[587]  For example, when we talk about the leading by the Spirit, spontaneously you may consider that you need to seek after the Lord s leading concerning a business trip or concerning getting married or concerning what school you should attend.
[588]  When you read the newspaper you may live in one way, and when you read a Life-study message you may live in another way.
[589]  We must be those all the time living our life in one way.
[590]  Whether we are at home, in the church matters, or in the meeting, we live our life one way.
[591]  Most of the brothers don t apply Romans 8 to the way they talk to their wives.
[592]  If you don t apply Romans 8 when you talk to your wife, the Perfecting Training has been in vain.
[593]  Fourthly, there is the spirit v. 4 . This means our human spirit.
[594]  Today this spirit is not merely our human spirit.
[595]  If you fully realize that the Triune God is within you as the law, that you have His Spirit, that you have Him as the life within you, and that now your spirit has been strengthened, empowered, enriched, and uplifted by and with the Spirit, surely you would be beside yourself.
[596]  Next are the things of the Spirit v. 5 . Following this is the mind set on the spirit v. 6 , followed by the peace v. 6 . After this you come to the Spirit in three aspects: the Spirit of God v. 9 , the Spirit of Christ v. 9 , and the Spirit of the resurrecting One v. 11 . These are not three Spirits but one Spirit with three aspects: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One.
[597]  In Romans 8 there are eleven positive items which may be considered as the components of the spiritual leading.
[598]  As such a person, you surely are a son of God.
[599]  You are no longer merely a son of Adam, but a son of God.
[600]  One thing I have to make clear: If you say that we could become a part of the Godhead as an object of worship, that is blasphemy.
[601]  But if you say that we could be made like God in life and in nature, not as an object of people s worship, this is altogether right.
[602]  We praise You that You have a people on this earth seeking after Your heart and coming together week after week.
[603]  In this group of three, the second item is the things of God.
[604]  Those who are according to such a mingled spirit mind the things of God.
[605]  Firstly there is the complication of the mingled spirit, and now there are the things of God.
[606]  After this there is the third item, that is, the mind set on the things of God.
[607]  The things which you are praising for become your enjoyment and become a base, a ground, for you to set your entire soul on.
[608]  You have to set your mind on these things.
[609]  Firstly, your spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit of God; then it is wrapped up with all these things of God concerning Christ.
[610]  If your mind is set upon all these wonderful things of God concerning Christ, you would surely be a wonderful person filled up with Christ and saturated with all the things of God.
[611]  I am burdened to turn your understanding of Romans 8 from the physical way to the abstract, mysterious way.
[612]  Our God is almighty, but it seems even He cannot change your understanding concerning Romans 8.
