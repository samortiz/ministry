<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California, from August 4 through September 2, 1964. This second edition is the revised edition published in 2005 in <em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The following chapters are the messages given in the 1964 summer conference in Los Angeles. The spoken form has been retained. The author would urge all the readers to give their attention to the spiritual reality conveyed in these messages rather than to the language itself.</p>
<p>The word <em>economy</em> used in the title of this book may sound somewhat strange to the reader. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s economy&rdquo; is a quotation from 1 Timothy 1:4. <em>Economy</em> is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>
oikonomia,</em> which denotes primarily a household management, a household administration, arrangement, distribution, or dispensation (of wealth, property, affairs, etc.). It is used with the intention of stressing the focal point of God&rsquo;s divine enterprise, which is to distribute, or dispense, Himself into man.</p>
<p>The three persons in the Godhead are for God&rsquo;s economy, the divine distribution, the holy dispensation. The Father as the source is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the course is realized in  the Spirit as the transmission. God the Father is a Spirit (John 4:24), and God the Son, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). All is in God the Spirit, who is the Holy Spirit revealed in the New Testament. This Holy Spirit today, with the fullness of the Father in the riches of the Son, has come into our human spirit and dwells there to impart all that God is into our very being. This is God&rsquo;s economy, the divine dispensation. The Holy Spirit of God, dwelling in our human spirit to dispense all that God is in Christ into our being, is the focus, the very mark, of this mysterious distribution of the Triune God. This is the battleground of the spiritual warfare. How much the subtle enemy has been and still is distracting the saints of God, even the seeking ones, from this mark of God&rsquo;s economy by many good and even scriptural things! In such a time of confusion, as in the time when the Epistles to Timothy were written, we must be narrowed down and even zeroed in to the all-inclusive divine Spirit in our human spirit that we may be kept from missing the mark of the divine economy. Therefore, returning to, abiding in, and exercising our spirit to realize the Spirit of God are fundamentally necessary today. It is by so doing that we can partake of all the fullness of God by enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ. May the Lord grant us grace that we may be brought into such a realization and practice it in our daily life and in all that we do.</p>
<p>For a proper application and better result, all the chapters in this book need to be read with a praying spirit. It will be more profitable to pray-read all the quotations of the Scriptures in every chapter and always accompany the reading with prayer. May the Lord&rsquo;s presence with His sweet anointing within be realized by all the readers in their reading of these chapters in the spirit.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE ECONOMY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<p>My burden in all the chapters of this book is to share with you something of God&rsquo;s economy. Let us read 1 Timothy chapter 1, verses 3 through 7: &ldquo;That you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith. But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses contain two very important expressions: <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em> and <em>misaimed.</em> The apostle Paul was chosen by God to bear the responsibility for God&rsquo;s economy, and he trained his spiritual son Timothy in this economy. It is quite interesting to note that Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to Timothy were written at a time when many Christians had drifted from the original pathway. They had missed the central mark of God&rsquo;s economy and were paying attention to something else.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTRACTIONS FROM GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>According to history, two prevailing elements distracted the early Christians from the right track: Judaism and Gnosticism. Both the Judaizers with their religious doctrines and forms and the Gnostics with their philosophies deterred the Christians from following the Lord in the pathway of God&rsquo;s economy. Apparently, it was the good elements of Judaism and Gnosticism that sidetracked these early Christians. If these elements had not been comparatively good, they could never have been prevailing enough to cause the believers to miss the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. For instance, the Judaizers strongly stressed the Mosaic law of the Old Testament. There certainly was nothing wrong with the law. On the contrary, it was unquestionably right and good and was given directly by God Himself. But the law in itself was not related to the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. Gnosticism, from the human point of view, also had its good principles. In fact, it was one of the best inventions of human civilization and was somewhat a help to the heathen. But the Gnostics tried to bring their philosophy into the church, distracting the early Christians from the mark of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Today, even though there may be no Judaizers or Gnostics to disturb us, there is still much to distract us. For nearly twenty centuries the subtle one has never ceased using the seemingly good things to divert believers from following the Lord in the right track. If we spend time with the Lord, we will realize that the enemy is persistent in utilizing even the good things of Christianity to distract the Lord&rsquo;s children from the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. While I was traveling through many districts in the United States during the last few years, I realized that many religious matters and even scriptural things have been used by the subtle enemy to influence seeking Christians to depart from the pathway of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>What is God&rsquo;s economy? The Scriptures, composed of sixty-six books, contain many different teachings, but if we would make a thorough and careful study of the Scriptures with spiritual insight, we would realize that God&rsquo;s economy is simply His plan to dispense Himself into humanity. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s dispensation, which means nothing other than God dispensing Himself into the human race. It is regrettable that the term <em>dispensation</em> has been misused by Christianity. Its definition is nearly the same as the Greek word for <em>economy.</em> It means &ldquo;an administrative arrangement, a governmental management,&rdquo; and refers to the dispensing, distributing stewardship of God&rsquo;s plan. In this divine dispensation God, who is almighty and all-inclusive, intends to dispense nothing other than Himself into us. This needs to be repeated many times in order to impress us deeply.</p>
<p>God is exceedingly rich. He is like a successful businessman who has an enormous amount of capital. God has a business in this universe, and His vast wealth is His capital. We do not realize how many billions, countless billions, He has. All this capital is simply Himself, and with it He intends to &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; Himself in mass production. God Himself is the Businessman, the capital, and the product. His intention is to dispense Himself into many people in mass production and free of charge. Therefore, God requires such a divine arrangement, a divine management, a divine dispensation, a divine economy, in order to bring Himself into humanity.</p>
<p>Let us be more specific. Now that we know that God&rsquo;s purpose is to dispense Himself into humanity, we must discover what God is in order to know what He is dispensing. In other words, we need to know the substance of God. When a businessman plans to manufacture a product, he must first of all be clear about the substance of the product, or its basic constituent. God&rsquo;s substance is Spirit (John 4:24). The very essence of the almighty, all-inclusive, universal God is simply Spirit. God is the Manufacturer, and He intends to reproduce Himself as the product; therefore, whatever He reproduces must be Spirit, the very substance of Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>We have seen God&rsquo;s purpose and what is dispensed by God; now we must realize how God is dispensed through His economy. In other words, Spirit is what God dispenses into man, but now we need to see the means by which He does this. God dispenses Himself into man by means of the Trinity. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;is the very economy of the Godhead. Christianity during the past centuries has had many teachings concerning the Trinity, but the Trinity can never be adequately understood unless He is related to the divine economy. Why are all three persons of the Godhead required for the development of God&rsquo;s economy? We know that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three different Gods but one God, who is expressed in three persons. Yet what is the purpose of there being three persons in the Godhead? Why are there God the Father, God the Son, and also God the Holy Spirit? It is because only through the Trinity can the essential means be provided whereby His Spirit is dispensed into us.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 shows the steps of God&rsquo;s economy carried out by the Trinity: &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Here we have the grace of the Son, the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. What are these? Are the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit three different Gods? Are love, grace, and fellowship three different items? No. Love, grace, and fellowship are one element in three stages: love is the source, grace is the expression of love, and fellowship is the transmission of love in grace. Likewise, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are one God expressed in three persons: God is the source, Christ is the expression of God, and the Holy Spirit is the transmission bringing God in Christ into man. Thus, the three persons of the Trinity become the three successive steps in the process of God&rsquo;s economy. Without these three steps God&rsquo;s essence could never be dispensed into man. The economy of God is developed from the Father, in the Son, and through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">From the Father</h2>
<p>God the Father is the universal source of all things. He is invisible and unapproachable. How can God the Father, who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), be within us? How can we see the invisible Father? If God were only the Father, He would be inaccessible and could not be dispensed into man. But through the divine arrangement of His economy, He put Himself into His Son, the second person of the Trinity, in order to make Himself available to man. All the fullness of the Father dwells in the Son (Col. 1:19; 2:9) and is expressed through the Son (John 1:18). The Father, as the inexhaustible source of everything, is embodied in the Son (14:10). The incomprehensible God is now expressed in Christ, who is the Word of God (1:1); the invisible God is revealed in Christ, who is the image of God (Col. 1:15). Hence, the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30), and the Son is even called the Father (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>Formerly, it was impossible for man to contact the Father. He was exclusively God, and His nature was exclusively divine. There was nothing in the Father to bridge the gap between God and man. But now He has not only embodied Himself in the Son; He has also become incarnate in human nature. The Father was pleased to combine His own divinity with humanity in the Son. Through the incarnation of the Son, the unapproachable Father is now approachable to man. By this, man can see the Father, touch the Father, and fellowship with the Father through the Son.</p>
<p>We can demonstrate this relationship by dipping a white handkerchief into blue dye. The Father&rsquo;s divinity can be likened to the white handkerchief. This handkerchief, dipped into blue dye, represents the Father in the Son becoming incarnate in humanity. The white article has now become blue. Just as blue was added to the handkerchief, so the human nature was added to the divine nature, and the once-separated natures have become one. The first step of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into man, therefore, is through the embodiment and incarnation of Himself in the Son as a man. By taking such a step, God reproduced Himself in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Son</h2>
<p>The second step of bringing God into man is through the second person of the Trinity, the Son of God. In order to understand the second stage of the economy of God, we need to know what Christ is. What are the elements that make up Christ? What are the ingredients combined together that constitute Christ?</p>
<p>There are seven basic elements that make up this wonderful person, six of which were added through His history. First, Christ is the divine embodiment of God. The first element in Christ is God&rsquo;s divine essence and nature.</p>
<p>The second element, the human nature, was added through His incarnation. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was the mingling of His divine nature with the human nature. Through His incarnation Christ brought God into man and mingled the divine essence of God with humanity. In Christ there is not only God but also man.</p>
<p>The third element, which was added to His divine nature and His human nature, was His human living. This glorious God-man lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years and experienced all the common and ordinary things that make up the daily human life. The Gospel of John, which emphasizes that He is the Son of God, also tells us that He was tired, hungry, and thirsty and that He wept (4:6-8, 31; 11:35). His human sufferings also were part of His daily life, which included many earthly troubles, problems, trials, and persecutions.</p>
<p>His experience of death is the fourth element. He went down into death. But He not only stepped into death; He also passed through death. This produced a very effective death. The death of Adam is terrible and chaotic, but the death of Christ is wonderful and effective. The death of Adam enslaved us to death, whereas the death of Christ released us from death. Although the fall of Adam brought many evil elements into us, the effective death of Christ is the killing power within us to slay all the elements of Adam&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Christ there is the divine nature, the human nature, the daily human life with its sufferings, and also the effectiveness of His death. But there are three additional elements in Christ. The fifth element is His resurrection. After His resurrection Christ did not put off His manhood to become solely God again. Christ is still a man (1 Tim. 2:5). Furthermore, as man He has the additional element of resurrection life mingled with His humanity.</p>
<p>The sixth element in Christ is His ascension. By His ascension to the heavens He transcended all enemies, principalities, powers, dominions, and authorities. All are under His feet (Eph. 1:20-22a). Therefore, the transcendent power of His ascension is mingled with Him.</p>
<p>Finally, the seventh element in Christ is His enthronement. Christ, the man with the divine nature, is enthroned in the third heaven as the exalted Head of the whole universe (v. 22b). He is in the heavenlies as the Lord of lords and the King of kings (Rev. 17:14; 19:16).</p>
<p>We need to remember the seven wonderful elements that are in Christ: the divine nature, the human nature, the daily human life with its earthly sufferings, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection power, the transcendent power of His ascension, and His enthronement. All these elements are mingled in this one marvelous Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Spirit</h2>
<p>God, however, cannot come into us through the Son. According to the first steps of His economy, the Father placed Himself in the Son, and the Son has the seven elements mingled with Himself. But we still need another step, a third and final step, for God to dispense Himself into man. The first step was that the Father embodied Himself in the Son, and the second step was that the Son became incarnated in humanity to have all the seven wonderful elements mingled with Him. The third step is that both the Father and the Son are now in the Spirit. All that is in the Father is in the Son, and both the Father and the Son, containing all the elements in Christ, are brought into the Spirit (John 16:14-15).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, after the Lord&#8217;s ascension, is no longer the same as the Spirit of God in the Old Testament times. The Spirit of God in the Old Testament had only one element-the divine nature of God. As the divine Spirit, He did not have the elements of Christ&#8217;s human nature, His daily human life, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His enthronement. Today, however, under the New Testament economy all the seven elements of Christ have been placed in the Spirit, and this all-inclusive Spirit has come into us and upon us. In other words, He is in us and we are in Him. This is the real mingling of God with man, which we can experience at any time. We are mingled inwardly and outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>What is the Holy Spirit? He is the Spirit of truth (14:26; 15:26; 16:13). But what is truth? The meaning of the Greek word for <em>truth</em> is &#8220;reality.&#8221; Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality. As such, He is the full reality of Christ. Just as God is embodied in Christ, so Christ is realized in the wonderful person of the Holy Spirit. Christ is not separate from God, and the Spirit is not separate from Christ. Christ is God expressed, and the Spirit is Christ realized in reality.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; This verse proves that the Holy Spirit is not separate from Christ. The Lord is Christ Himself, and He is referred to as the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; Again, the Scriptures point out that Christ, the last Adam, is the Spirit. We must admit that this life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6).</p>
<p>Furthermore, God the Father is also the Spirit (John 4:24). Hence, all three persons of the Godhead are the Spirit. If God the Father is not the Spirit, how could He be in us, and how could we contact Him? Moreover, if God the Son is not the Spirit, how could He be in us, and how could we experience Him? Because the Father and the Son are both the Spirit, we can easily contact God and experience Christ.</p>
<p>Consider the following verses (italics added for emphasis): &#8220;One God and Father of all, who is...<em>in</em> all&#8221; (Eph. 4:6); &#8220;Jesus Christ is <em>in</em> you&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:5); &#8220;His Spirit who <em>in</em> dwells you&#8221; (Rom. 8:11). These three verses reveal that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. How many persons, then, are in us? Three or one? We should not say that three separate persons are in us, nor should we say that only one person is in us. Rather, we should say that the Three-in-one is in us. The three persons of the Godhead are not three Spirits but one Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son with all His seven wonderful elements is in the Spirit. When this wonderful Holy Spirit comes into us, the Godhead is dispensed into us. Because the three persons are in one Spirit, we have the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit within us. Later, we will see that the Triune God is in our human spirit to be our spiritual, inner life. This is the very mark of God&#8217;s economy, and this is the method whereby the Godhead is dispensed into us. The goal of the divine economy is to dispense the Triune God in one Spirit into our human spirit. Hence, we must now focus our whole attention on living by the Triune God, who dwells in our human spirit. If we are distracted from this, however good and scriptural other things may be, we will surely miss the mark of God&#8217;s economy. The Lord today is recovering His children by causing them to center on this mark of His divine economy.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE ALL-SUFFICIENT SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT IS THE TRANSMISSION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In chapter 1 we saw that God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into us by means of the three persons of the Godhead. Electricity can be used to illustrate the economy of the Trinity. It includes the source, the current, and the transmission. These seem to be three different kinds of electricity, but in reality they are one. The source, the current, and the transmission are the electricity itself. If the electricity did not exist, neither the source, the current, nor the transmission could exist. Just as there is one electricity with three different stages, there is one God with three persons. At one end is the source or the storage of electricity, and at the other end is the transmission of electricity into our homes. Between the two ends is the current. This is an example of three stages of one and the same thing. God as the Father is the source, God as the Son is the course and the very expression of the Father, and God as the Spirit is the transmission of God into man. Therefore, the Father is the Spirit, the Son also is the Spirit, and the Spirit, of course, is the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us as the very transmission of God, transmitting constantly all that God is and has in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT IS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DOSE</h2>
<p>In this modern era man has perfected many drugs in the field of medicine. Some drugs are composed of a great number of elements and can be dispensed in one single dose. In just one dose, some of the elements can destroy germs, others can relax the nerves, and still other elements can nourish and refresh the body. This is an all-inclusive dose. Have we ever realized that the Holy Spirit is the best &ldquo;dose&rdquo; in the whole world? Just one dose is enough to meet all our needs. All that the Father and the Son are and all that They have are in this wonderful Spirit. Consider how many elements are within this dose: God&rsquo;s divine nature with Christ&rsquo;s human nature, His human living with its earthly sufferings, the wonderful effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His enthronement. Such a dose is beyond our imagination. Yet, praise the Lord, every day we can enjoy it. No scientist or medical doctor on earth could analyze this wonderful dose. This dose is what we enjoy in the economy of God, which is nothing else but God dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of learning doctrines. When I was young, I learned all the doctrines about the various dispensations. I was taught that there were at least seven dispensations. But strictly speaking, there is only one dispensation that we need&mdash;the economy of God with the dispensing of God Himself. The sixty-six books of the Scriptures are a full record of this one dispensation&mdash;the dispensing of God Himself into us. Our urgent need is to partake of Him all the day as the all-inclusive dose in the wonderful Spirit. Let us enjoy God Himself, not the dispensational doctrines.</p>
<p>If you are weak, there is a dose, a wonderful dose, to strengthen you with might and divine power. If you are troubled, the cure is in the dose. One dose of the Holy Spirit will cure all your troubles.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was taught that I had been crucified with Christ and that I needed to reckon myself dead. Thus, from morning until evening I was on the alert to reckon myself dead. But the more I did so, the more I became alive. It did not work, because it was the wrong formula. After many years, one day the Lord opened my eyes to see that the reality of His death is not in my reckoning but in my enjoyment of the Holy Spirit. This is revealed in Romans 8. Romans 6 gives only the definition, but Romans 8 gives the reality of the death of Christ, because the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is in the Holy Spirit. The more we fellowship with Christ in the Holy Spirit, the more we will be slain. The dose of the all-inclusive Holy Spirit contains the killing element. When we are in the Holy Spirit, there is no need to reckon ourselves dead, because we are enjoying Him as this wonderful dose. Spontaneously the many germs within us are killed.</p>
<p>Formerly, when I hated a brother, I was told that the &ldquo;hating I&rdquo; was crucified and instead of hating the brother, I should love him. After hearing this, I tried to reckon myself dead, but it did not work. The more I reckoned myself dead, the more I hated him. Then one day while fellowshipping with the Lord, I was filled with His Holy Spirit. How the tears flowed! I knew that the killing power was within me, killing my hatred and my pride. Automatically, love mingled with tears welled up from my heart for this brother. What was this? This was the killing element in the wonderful dose, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Within this Spirit of Jesus there is an all-sufficient supply. The word <em>supply</em> in Philippians 1:19 is a special Greek word referring to a bountiful or all-inclusive supply. The Spirit of Jesus is an all-inclusive supply in which all our needs are met. What do we need? Do we need comfort? No one can truly comfort us&mdash;not even our children, our parents, or our dear wife. Real comfort comes from the indwelling Spirit of Jesus. When we fellowship with Jesus in this Spirit and when we live in this wonderful Spirit, we automatically have inward comfort. Regardless of the outward environment, there is inward rest and comfort.</p>
<p>We may say, &ldquo;I do not know what to do. I need guidance.&rdquo; Living guidance is in the Holy Spirit. When we fellowship with the Lord and walk in the Holy Spirit, we will spontaneously have inward light for guidance. Everything&mdash;including guidance&mdash;is in the Holy Spirit. Today He is in us as the all-inclusive dose. We need not ask or cry. We need only to take Him, enjoy Him, and praise Him.</p>
<p>For example, a sister was in trouble and did not know what to do. Although she had no clear guidance, she went to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that I have no guidance. I praise You that I do not know what to do. I praise You that I am in darkness.&rdquo; What happened? The more she praised, the more she was in the light. Let us do the same thing. When we are weak, let us go to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;I praise You, Lord, that in this situation I am weak.&rdquo; By contacting Him, we will see what a wonderful Spirit He is, dwelling within us to be the bountiful and all-sufficient supply.</p>
<p>Too many doctrines in Christianity are distracting the Lord&rsquo;s people from the Lord Himself, causing them to miss the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. What is this mark? It is simply the all-inclusive Holy Spirit dwelling in our human spirit. During the whole day we need to learn how to contact and follow the Holy Spirit. We need to learn how to fellowship and deal with Him. Christianity teaches us to deal with forms, regulations, and doctrines. Christians even read the Scriptures in a wrong way, since they make little or no contact with the Holy Spirit in their reading. They merely learn doctrines in black and white letters. We need to read the Scriptures by exercising our spirit to contact the Holy Spirit, not by merely using our eyes to see the words and exercising our minds to understand the teachings. From morning to evening we must deal with the One who dwells in us, for He is the bountiful supply of the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT IS THE MUTUAL ABODE</h2>
<p>John 14:23 says that the Father and the Lord will come to make Their abode with us. What does this mean? Have you ever experienced the Father and the Son coming to make Their abode with you? This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy that we are considering. This abode has two aspects&mdash;the Father and the Son become our abode, and we become Their abode. Thus, it is a mutual abode. How is this mutual abode possible? Only as we are in the Spirit, just as the Father and the Son are in the Spirit, can we experience this mutual abiding. When we are in the Spirit, we are abiding in the Son and the Father, and at the same time They are abiding in us. Only then will we have an intimate communion and fellowship with the Father and the Son. We will have an inward &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; We will talk with the Lord, and the Lord will talk with us. These are the practical experiences of the mutual abode.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT IS THE INNER LIFE<br />
AND THE OUTER CLOTHING</h2>
<p>The Lord is also the Spirit of life within us as water that refreshes, strengthens, and fills us with the inner life (7:37-39).</p>
<p>The Lord as the Holy Spirit is also likened to clothing. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;Stay in the city until you put on power from on high.&rdquo; In some versions the Greek word for <em>put on</em> is translated &ldquo;are clothed with.&rdquo; Clothing indicates power and authority. Today when anyone is performing an official act of responsibility, he needs a uniform. If a policeman stood on the street in plain clothes without his uniform, no one would respect him as a policeman. He would have lost his authority because he lacked a uniform. When we see a policeman in uniform while we are driving, we suddenly become very cautious. When he wears his uniform, the policeman is clothed with authority. The Holy Spirit within is the supply of life, and the Holy Spirit without is the uniform of authority. When we are clothed with Him, we have the highest authority in the universe.</p>
<p>After His resurrection the Lord came to His disciples and breathed into them (John 20:19-22). He called that very breath the Holy Spirit, because He Himself is the Holy Spirit. Whatever comes out of Him must be the Holy Spirit. We know that breath is something of life and something for life. The Lord&rsquo;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the imparting of His Spirit of life into them. On the day of resurrection all the disciples received the Spirit of life within them. They received the inner drinking of the water of life.</p>
<p>However, at that time they were without power. The uniform had not yet been given. Therefore, the Lord told them to wait until He had ascended to the heavens to be enthroned as the Head and the authority of the universe. It was by His ascension and enthronement that He gained the position to pour Himself down in the Holy Spirit as the authority. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down, not as life but as power (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>Therefore, on the day of resurrection, which is the day of life, the Holy Spirit came out of the Lord and entered the disciples as the breath of life. But on the day of Pentecost, which is the day of power, the Holy Spirit came from the ascended and enthroned Head and equipped the disciples with authority for service. This is the Holy Spirit of power as the uniform.</p>
<p>Suppose a policeman is preparing to go on duty. What does he usually do before beginning his work? Early in the morning he may drink several cups of some beverage in order to refresh and strengthen himself. But will he, by filling up with this beverage, be qualified to perform his duty as a policeman? If he merely goes out into the street without the uniform, exclaiming, &ldquo;I am full; now I am a policeman,&rdquo; no one will respect him. They will say that he is crazy. He is a real policeman, yet without the uniform he lacks authority. But when he puts on the uniform, he is equipped with the power of authority. Then when he goes out on the street, everyone will respect him as a man with the authority of the local police. We must not despise his uniform. This uniform represents the authority of the government. On the other hand, if the policeman drinks nothing in the morning, he will be weak. He may put on his uniform and exercise his position of authority, but he will have no inward strength and refreshment.</p>
<p>Some Christians who are filled within are without the uniform, and other Christians who wear a proper uniform are empty within. We need both the inward filling and the outward equipping. We need the Holy Spirit of the resurrection day as life within us and the Holy Spirit of the Pentecostal day as power upon us. The filling of the Holy Spirit is necessary inwardly; the clothing of the Holy Spirit is necessary outwardly. If we have both aspects of the Spirit, we will experience the blessed mingling of the Holy Spirit within and without. And who is the Spirit? Remember that the Spirit is the very reality of the Triune God. As we are filled and clothed with the Holy Spirit, we are mingled with the Triune God. This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>We need to pay our attention to this mark of God&rsquo;s economy and not to mere doctrine. Some try to argue about doctrines. They say, &ldquo;What about the rapture?&rdquo; Many Christians are troubled about post-tribulation rapture, pre-tribulation rapture, partial rapture, or some other kind of rapture. Once I told a dear brother, &ldquo;As long as you love the Lord and live by Him, when He comes back, you will be raptured. That is good enough.&rdquo; Let us forget about doctrines and learn to love Him. Let us aim at the mark of His economy, deal with the living Christ in the Holy Spirit, and be filled and clothed with Him.</p>
<p>Some argue about eternal security, but the real security is simply Christ Himself (Heb. 7:22), not the teaching of eternal security. As long as we have Christ, we have security. If we do not have Christ, we do not have security. The doctrine of eternal security is not Christ. Doctrine has been a strong factor of division among the Lord&rsquo;s children. If we love Christ, walk by the living Spirit, and do not emphasize doctrines, we will be one with all saints. The more we talk about doctrines, the more we will quarrel. Today while we talk about the Holy Spirit, the wonderful dose, we all say Amen! Hallelujah! But tomorrow, if we talk about eternal security, some will say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I cannot agree.&rdquo; Immediately we will be divided, and this means that we have missed the mark. We will be teaching things that only raise questions rather than concentrating our full attention on the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. What is the mark? It is the Father in the Son, the Son in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit in us.</p>
<p>Others argue about baptism. For instance, some try to convince others by insisting on baptism by sprinkling. Again, this is a matter of doctrine and not a matter of the Spirit of the living Christ. We must learn to grasp one thing and to be grasped by one thing&mdash;Christ Himself. We must learn how to grasp Christ in the Holy Spirit and be grasped by the Holy Spirit. Although we can certainly receive help from doctrine, the main center of God&rsquo;s economy is not doctrine but the living One in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT IS THE LIFE-GIVING,<br />
LIBERATING, TRANSFORMING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we contact this living One in the wonderful Holy Spirit throughout the whole day, three things will happen within. First, the life-giving Spirit will impart life to us (2 Cor. 3:6). Whenever we contact this wonderful Spirit, we will have the inner refreshing, the inner strengthening, the inner satisfying, and the inner enlightening. These are indications that Christ as life is being imparted more and more into us. We might have been a Christian for more than eighty years, but we still need the Christ of God as the life-giving Spirit imparting Himself into us, refreshing us, strengthening us, satisfying us, enlightening us, and filling us. This wonderful Spirit is within us to impart Christ as our bountiful supply.</p>
<p>Next, the Holy Spirit will continually liberate us (v. 17). Many oppressions and depressions of the day tend to weaken us. Sometimes a person&rsquo;s long face will depress us. Sometimes your wife may not feel well, and when you arrive home from work, she may become unhappy with you. Later, if you come to a meeting, you will appear with a long face. People will ask, &ldquo;What happened to you, brother?&rdquo; And you will say, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You will not dare to tell them that your wife influenced you by her behavior. Such a small matter can suppress and depress you. However, if you contact the living Christ within you, He will immediately liberate you. You will be transcendent far above your wife&rsquo;s behavior, and all the depression will be under your feet. You will be liberated to the throne in the third heaven. Many times when I was prepared to come to a ministry meeting, something would happen. But I learned the lesson. I said, &ldquo;Lord, I am in the heavens; I will not be disturbed by all these things.&rdquo; If we are in the Holy Spirit, we will be transcendent, because in this wonderful Spirit are the elements of ascension and transcendence. When we are in Him, these elements in the Spirit will liberate us all the day.</p>
<p>Finally, while He imparts life and liberates us, the Holy Spirit also transforms us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>transformed</em> is the same word as in Romans 12:2: &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; To be transformed does not mean merely to be changed outwardly; it means to be changed both in nature within and in form without. As we behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from one degree of glory to another. When a mirror beholds an object, it reflects what it beholds. But if a mirror is veiled, its &ldquo;face&rdquo; is not open; even if it beholds an object, it will be unable to reflect it. If we are an unveiled mirror, we will reflect Christ by beholding Him. This is the process of transformation. The Lord is the Spirit who transforms us within. Although we are natural and even sinful, the Spirit transforms our natural image into His glorious image. During the whole day, if we live in the Spirit, He will transform us by renewing our mind, our emotion, and our will. By saturating our mind, emotion, and will with Himself, He will occupy all the inward parts of our being. Our love, our hatred, our desires, our choices, and our decisions will bear His image. We will be transformed into His image from glory to glory&mdash;that is, today we are being transformed in the first stage of glory, tomorrow we will be transformed in the second stage of glory, and the next day we will be transformed in the third stage of glory. Every day the glory will be increased.</p> 
<p>The economy of God and the aim of His economy are that God intends to dispense Himself into us and mingle us with Himself in His glory. Then we will be able to express Him. Let us be faithful to this aim, let us hold fast to this mark, and let us go on to reach this goal.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RESIDENCE OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In John 3:6 we read, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse speaks of two distinct spirits&mdash;one is indicated by a capitalized word, and the other is indicated by a lowercase word. The first occurrence of the word <em>spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit of God, and the second, to the human spirit of man. That which is born of the Holy Spirit is the human spirit. Another verse showing these two spirits is John 4:24: &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; Again, the first word is capitalized, and the second is not. We must worship God, who is Spirit, in our human spirit. Romans 8:16 further confirms the existence of the two spirits: &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The pronoun <em>our</em> definitely designates the human spirit and removes any ground to doubt the reality of both the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:9 and 10 we read, &ldquo;The Spirit of God dwells in you...But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead..., the spirit is life.&rdquo; The King James Version capitalizes <em>spirit</em> in verse 10, but the better translations, such as the American Standard Version, render <em>spirit</em> with a small letter <em>s.</em> Why do we point this out? It is because Christians have very little knowledge concerning man&rsquo;s spirit. Much attention is given to the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit, the residence and dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, is almost entirely neglected. If someone wants to visit me, he must first find where I live. If he cannot locate my home, he will lose the opportunity to visit me. Although there is much talk about the Holy Spirit, most Christians do not know where He dwells. Romans 8:9 refers without a doubt to the Holy Spirit, but verse 10 speaks of the human spirit: &ldquo;Though the body is dead..., the spirit is life.&rdquo; Of course, the Holy Spirit cannot be compared with our body. The comparison must be between the human body and the human spirit, not between the human body and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In Romans 1:9 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&rdquo; The common thought is that we serve God in the Holy Spirit, but this verse declares that we serve God in our human spirit.</p>
<p>Bible translators have found it very difficult to decide whether the word <em>spirit</em> in some passages refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. The reason for this difficulty is that in the believer the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are mingled together as one spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We are one spirit with the Lord. This indicates a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit. Because of such a mingling, in some Bible verses it is difficult to say whether the word <em>spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. In us the two spirits are mingled as one. We may say that this mingled spirit is the Holy Spirit, and we may also say that it is the human spirit. Sometimes we make a beverage by mixing two kinds of juices&mdash;pineapple and grapefruit. After the two are mixed, it is difficult to tell what kind of juice it is. Is it pineapple, or is it grapefruit? We might refer to it as pineapple-grapefruit juice. In the New Testament it is wonderful to see that the two spirits, the Holy Spirit and our spirit, are one mingled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOCATING THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the first chapter we saw that God the Father is in us (Eph. 4:6), Christ is in us (2 Cor. 13:5), and the Holy Spirit is in us (Rom. 8:11). All three persons of the Triune God are in us. But where within us is the Triune God? In what part of our being? It is very clear, beyond any ground of argument, that Christ today is in our spirit. The Scriptures confirm this fact. We do not need to be vague, like many who say in a general way that the Lord is in us. The last verse of 2 Timothy definitely states that Christ is in our spirit: &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:22). In order for Christ to be in our spirit, first He must be the Spirit, then we must have a spirit, and finally these two spirits must be mingled as one spirit. If the Lord were not the Spirit, how could He be in our spirit, and how could we be one spirit with Him?</p>
<p>In order to locate the human spirit, we need to divide the soul from the spirit. Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s word is a sharp sword to pierce our being, to divide our soul from our spirit.</p>
<p>We are told in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are the temple of God. According to the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s temple is portrayed as having three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_1.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>We know that God was in His temple, but in what part? He was neither in the outer court nor in the Holy Place; rather, He was in the Holy of Holies. There in the Holy of Holies the shekinah presence of God dwelt. In the outer court was the altar, which is a type of the cross, and near the altar was the laver, which typifies the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit. In the Holy Place were the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. In addition to all these items, in the Holy of Holies was the Ark, which typifies Christ. Therefore, Christ was in the Holy of Holies, and God&rsquo;s presence, the shekinah glory of God, was there also.</p>
<p>The Scriptures point out that today we are the temple of God (1 Cor. 3:16). As tripartite beings, we too are composed of three parts&mdash;the body, the soul, and the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). But in which part of our being does the Triune God dwell? Second Timothy 4:22 states clearly that the Lord is in our spirit. Our spirit is the very Holy of Holies. The typology of the Old Testament temple presents a very clear picture. Christ (typified by the Ark) and God&rsquo;s presence were in the Holy of Holies. Today the type of the temple of God is fulfilled in us. We are of three parts: our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul to the Holy Place, and our human spirit to the Holy of Holies, which is the very residence of Christ and God&rsquo;s presence. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_2.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; What is the Holy of Holies for us to enter today while we are here on earth? According to the above diagram, our human spirit is the Holy of Holies, which is God&rsquo;s residence, the very chamber in which God and Christ dwell. If we would find God and Christ, there is no need for us to go to heaven. God in Christ is so available, for He is in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVIDING THE SOUL FROM THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>For this reason we need to divide our soul from our spirit (Heb. 4:12). If we are unable to divide our soul from our spirit, we will simply be unable to contact the Lord. If the high priest had been unable to locate the Holy of Holies, his efforts to contact God would only have ended in failure. First, he had to enter the outer court, from the outer court he had to enter the Holy Place, and from the Holy Place he would finally enter the Holy of Holies. There he would meet God and see the shekinah glory of God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>We must learn to discern our spirit from our soul. The soul conceals and covers the spirit, just as the bones conceal the marrow. It is easy to see the bones, but it is difficult to see the marrow hidden within. In order to get to the marrow, we must break the bones. Sometimes the marrow has to be scraped from the bones. How our spirit sticks to our soul! Our spirit is hidden and concealed in our soul. The soul is easily recognized, but the spirit is difficult to know. We know a little about the Holy Spirit, but we do not know the human spirit. The reason for this is that the human spirit is concealed in the soul. Because of this the soul needs to be broken. Just as the bones are very strong, so our soul is very strong. We have a spirit, but our soul covers it up. God&rsquo;s Word as a sharp sword must pierce our soul in order to break it away from our spirit.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sabbath rest, Hebrews 4:9 and 11 say, &ldquo;So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God...Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.&rdquo; In order to discover the meaning of the Sabbath rest, we need to look at another type in the Old Testament. After the Israelites were delivered and saved from the land of Egypt, they were brought into the wilderness with the intention that they should go on into the land of Canaan. The land of Canaan was their land of rest (Deut. 12:9), a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Christ is the good land of Canaan, and He is our rest. In order to enter into the rest, we must enter into Christ. But where is Christ today? The answer is that He is in our spirit. The Israelites who had been delivered out of Egypt, instead of going on into Canaan, wandered for many years in the wilderness. This is a type showing that after being saved, many Christians simply wander in the soul. The reason the book to the Hebrews was written is that many Hebrew Christians had been saved, but they were wandering in their soul. They would not press on from the wilderness into the good land&mdash;that is, into Christ, who dwelt in their spirit. We must not continue to wander in our soul but must press on to enter into our spirit, where Christ is our rest. Let us illustrate further by the following diagram:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_3.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>In ancient times all the people of Israel had access to the outer court, but only the priests could enter the Holy Place. Furthermore, only one, the high priest, could enter into the Holy of Holies, and that only once a year (Lev. 16:3, 15-17, 34; Heb. 9:7). Moreover, of all the Israelites who were saved and brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, very few went on into the good land of Canaan (Num. 14:28-30).</p>
<p>Even though we might have been saved for years, we must ask ourselves whether we are presently a Christian living in the body, in the soul, or in the spirit. Are we now in Egypt, in the wilderness, or in the good land of Canaan? We need to ask the Lord and search ourselves in order to be clear where we are. Frankly, many Christians are wandering all day in the soul, that is, in the wilderness. In the morning they have smiling faces, but by afternoon they are sorrowful with long faces. Yesterday it seems they were in the heavens, but today they are down. They are wandering in the soul, the wilderness, without rest, circling in the same rut day after day. They might have been following the Lord for twenty years, but today they are still going in circles, just like the people of Israel, who wandered for thirty-eight years with no improvement and no progress. The reason for their wandering is that they are in the soul. When we are in the soul, we are in the wilderness.</p>
<p>This is the reason the writer of Hebrews emphasized the need to divide the soul from the spirit. The word of God must pierce us so that we may know how to press on from the soul into the good land and the Holy of Holies of our human spirit. A soulish believer is one who wanders in the wilderness of the soul, where there is no rest.</p>
<p>The high priest had to pass through the veil in order to enter the Holy of Holies; this indicates that the veil, which typifies the flesh (Heb. 10:20), must be rent and broken (Matt. 27:51). Furthermore, the people of Israel had to cross the Jordan River in order to enter the good land. Under the waters of the Jordan they buried twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, and another twelve stones, representing the resurrected Israelites, were brought over into the good land (Josh. 4:1-9). The old generation of Israel was buried in the death waters of the Jordan River. All of this typifies that the natural man, the soulish life, and the old nature must be broken as the veil and buried as the old man. Then we can enter into the Holy of Holies and into the good land in order to enjoy Christ as our rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISTRACTIONS FROM THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>These pictures will help us to realize that God&rsquo;s economy is the Triune God in our human spirit. This Triune God in the one Spirit has taken our spirit as His residence and His dwelling place (Eph. 2:22). Thus, we must learn to discern our spirit from our soul. The problem is that we Christians are full of many natural thoughts. After we have been saved, we think that we need to be good and to do good. But God in His economy intends to work Himself into us as our life and as everything to us. We must forget everything else and concentrate on the indwelling Christ in our spirit. We must not be distracted from the aim and mark of this indwelling Christ. We should forget about being good and doing good deeds. We need to drop all those good things and enter the Holy of Holies. Many Christians are busily working in the outer court. They do not know that God&rsquo;s intention for them is that they would enter into the Holy of Holies, where they can contact God, be filled with God, be occupied with God, be one with God in everything, and have God as their all. We must discern our spirit and fellowship with this indwelling One. We must let Him take us over and possess us.</p>
<p>Another religious distraction is that after we are saved, we feel that we are weak and that we need strength and power. Consequently, we pray that the Holy Spirit will be poured upon us that we may be made strong and powerful. Although there is some ground for us to do this, the main line of God&rsquo;s economy is that we follow Him not in this outward empowering but in our spirit, where the Triune God dwells. Therefore, the most vital thing is for us to know our spirit and to deny our soul. We need to reject our soul and walk according to our spirit, because the Triune God is in our spirit. This mark of God&rsquo;s economy is missed by most Christians&mdash;even the seeking ones.</p>
<p>Again we ask, where is the Triune God today? Praise the Lord that today this wonderful One, the Triune God, is in our spirit. We have Him in our spirit. The Triune God as the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit is in us. If we are a believer, we have the Triune God in our human spirit. Our need today is to discern our spirit from our soul. When we know the proper way to discern the spirit from the soul, we will hit the mark of contacting the Triune God.</p>
<p>In a radio there is a receiver, a receiving element. When we tune the radio accurately, the electric waves in the air contact that receiver. Today the Triune God is the spiritual electricity. He is the electric waves throughout the universe, and we are the &ldquo;radio.&rdquo; The receiver within us is our human spirit. We tune our human spirit rightly when we have a broken and contrite spirit (Psa. 34:18; 51:17; Isa. 57:15; 66:2), when we are repentant before God and open to Him. If we have such a spirit, the Triune God, who is the wonderful Spirit and who is the spiritual electricity, will immediately contact our spirit. All we need to know is how to tune the receiver, how to tune our human spirit, discerning our spirit from all other things, such as our thinking, our emotions, and our choices. When we discern our spirit from all these soulish things, we will know how to contact the divine Spirit, who is the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God. Then we will know the Lord&rsquo;s word as the sharp sword that pierces to divide our soul from our spirit, and we will realize how to experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ all the time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KEY TO THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In more than twenty translations of the New Testament there is a difference in the way the word <em>spirit</em> is treated. In some translations the word is capitalized in certain instances, and in the same instances in other translations it is not. What is the reason for such conflicting translations? In many passages it is difficult for any translator to decide whether <em>spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. Since our spirit has been mingled together with the Holy Spirit, the two spirits are mingled as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Therefore, one may assert that this mingled spirit is the human spirit, but another may say that this Spirit is the Holy Spirit. Of course, the context of some passages makes it clear that the reference is to the Holy Spirit, but in other passages the reference is to the human spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:10 says, &ldquo;But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; The context of this verse clearly indicates that the spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, because it is compared with the body. The Holy Spirit should not be compared with our body. It is our human spirit that the apostle was comparing with our body. What is the meaning of this verse? Originally our body was dead because of sin. Now Christ is in us, and though our sinful body is still dead because of sin, our spirit is alive and full of life because of righteousness. Therefore, the spirit mentioned in this verse is not the Holy Spirit but the human spirit, which is compared with the human body.</p>
<p>In another verse, Romans 8:11, it is obvious that reference is made to the Spirit of God. What follows the phrase <em>the Spirit of the One</em> defines whose Spirit it is: &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; Verse 10 tells us that though Christ is in us, our body is still dead because of sin. However, verse 11 declares that because of the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling, our weak, mortal body will also be enlivened, revived, and strengthened. Because Christ as the Spirit is living in us, even our mortal bodies, which are dead because of sin, can be enlivened and revived by the divine Spirit, who is dwelling within our spirit. The indwelling Spirit makes us alive not only in our spirit but eventually also in our body.</p> 
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT AS THE KEY</h2>
<p>Why are we emphasizing the difference between the Holy Spirit and the human spirit? It is because our greatest problem is that we do not know the indwelling Spirit or realize that the human spirit is the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; neither do we know that these two spirits have been mingled together as one spirit. What a pity this is! These two things are the mark of God&rsquo;s economy, and many Christians are missing this mark. A house is inaccessible when the key is missing. Only the key will open the house to us that we may enjoy everything in it. For centuries the enemy has covered the key to God&rsquo;s economy. This key is the fact that our human spirit is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and our human spirit is one with the wonderful Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Word of God is living and sharp, even sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit. For more than thirty years I tried to understand why this word was written and why it was written in Hebrews chapter 4. The Lord has revealed the reason. The book of Hebrews encourages us to press on from the wilderness into the good land, from the stage of wandering to the stage of resting in the all-inclusive Christ. At that time the Hebrew Christians were in danger of drifting away from Christ into Judaism, which is like the children of Israel returning to the land of Egypt (Num. 14:3-4). The Hebrew believers had been delivered out of Judaism and intended to enter into the good land of rest, but they were wandering midway between Judaism and Christ. The Epistle to the Hebrews was written to encourage them to press beyond the wandering stage by taking Christ as their all-inclusive life and rest.</p>
<p>Hebrews also refers to the Holy of Holies. Again, for many years I could not understand what the Holy of Holies is. Eventually, I was helped by the Lord to realize that the Holy of Holies is, in a sense, our spirit. Today our human spirit is the Holy of Holies. The three parts of the temple correspond to the three parts of man&mdash;body, soul, and spirit. The innermost part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, indicates the innermost part of our being, the human spirit. Just as the Ark, a type of Christ, was in the Holy of Holies, so Christ is in our spirit today. Our human spirit, therefore, is the Holy of Holies, the place where we can contact God. If we cannot discern our spirit, we cannot locate the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must be very clear that today the Triune God has completed everything. He has accomplished creation, incarnation, and Christ&rsquo;s human living with its sufferings on earth. He has entered into death and passed through death, and He has resurrected, ascended into heaven, and been enthroned. Everything has been attained by the wonderful Triune God, and all these realities are in the Holy Spirit, who has come into us. The point is that this Holy Spirit has been dispensed into our human spirit, which is now the residence of God. Our spirit is the organ to receive God and to contain Him. In order to contact this wonderful Spirit, we must know our spirit. If you intend to contact me, you must know where I live. Hebrews 4:12 was written to encourage us to press on into the Holy of Holies, which is our spirit. If we do not know how to discern our spirit, we will not be able to locate the Holy of Holies, the place where the Lord dwells today. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into us, and the very place where He dispenses Himself is our spirit. When we are able to discern our spirit and to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we can then be permeated and saturated with the Lord and be transformed into His image.</p><h2 class="head1">DISTRACTIONS FROM THE KEY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Good</h2>
<p>The enemy tries to frustrate us from discerning our spirit, and soon after we are saved, he does this by helping us make a decision to do good. No one is exempt from this subtle suggestion. Even this morning some have prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I want to do Your will; I want to please You; I will try my best to do the things that satisfy You.&rdquo; This sounds like a good prayer, but it is not from the Lord. Rather, it comes from the enemy. Whenever we have such good intentions, we must jump up and tell Satan to depart from us. In my Christian dictionary there is not such a word as <em>evil,</em> nor is there such a word as <em>good.</em> From the beginning to the end my Christian dictionary contains only one word&mdash;<em>Christ.</em> I understand neither good nor evil. I do not want help to do good; I want only Christ.</p>
<p>Now you can understand the Lord&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you...He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo; (John 15:4-5). Here there is nothing of self-effort; there is only abiding in the indwelling One and allowing Him to abide in us. If we will practice this abiding, all the riches of Christ will overflow from us. Fruit-bearing is simply the overflow of the indwelling Christ. We should say, &ldquo;I do not know this, and I do not know that. I only know one thing: I am a branch, and He is the vine; I must abide in Him and let Him abide in me.&rdquo; If this is our experience, spontaneously we will bear fruit. This is the missing key. Trying to do good is a real temptation and a great distraction from experiencing Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doctrines</h2>
<p>Doctrines form another device used by the enemy to distract the seeking ones from Christ. Through the centuries doctrines, such as eternal security, dispensations, predestination, absolute grace, etc., have been greatly used by the enemy to distract Christians from the living Christ. I knew some Christians who were so familiar with the Bible that one of them was even called &ldquo;the living concordance.&rdquo; If you could not find a certain portion in the Scriptures, these Christians could tell you immediately the book, chapter, and verse. But I can testify that they knew very little about contacting Christ as their life. To possess the knowledge of the Scriptures is one thing, but to know the living One revealed by the Scriptures is quite another. Christ must be contacted through the Scriptures. But it is regrettable that many Christians have the Scriptures only in their hand and in their memory, with very little of Christ in their spirit. The Mosaic law was given to conduct people to Christ and guard them for Christ (Gal. 3:23-24). It was to help people to know Christ, but many merely kept the law and ignored Christ. Therefore, the law was misused. Today the problem remains unchanged. The same principle applies to all the teachings and doctrines of the Scriptures. Doctrines are the means to experience Christ, but Christians use doctrines and knowledge to replace Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gifts</h2>
<p>Another thing that the enemy utilizes is the matter of spiritual gifts. A proper understanding of the gifts is necessary in order to see how they are related to God&rsquo;s economy. This applies to all gifts. Many gifted persons give too much attention to their gifts and, more or less, neglect the indwelling Christ. The indwelling Christ is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy, and all the gifts are for this. Many know how to speak in tongues and how to experience healing, but they do not know how to discern the spirit and contact Christ. Although I am not speaking against any gift, I am against one thing&mdash;paying full attention to the gifts and ignoring the discerning of the spirit in order to contact Christ. This is definitely wrong.</p>
<p>The book of Romans allots very little ground to the gifts. Romans is a general sketch of the Christian life and walk, and in such a sketch not much reference is made to gifts. Of sixteen chapters, only chapter 12 speaks something concerning gifts, and if we read the whole chapter, we will see that not only the gift of prophecy is mentioned, but even the gifts of showing mercy and of giving material things are listed (vv. 5-8). The gifts mentioned here result from the living Christ experienced as grace in each believer (v. 6). Not all Christians have the gift of prophecy (1 Cor. 12:29). It is only one of many gifts. We do not oppose any gift, but we must give a proper proportion to every gift; otherwise, we will be unbalanced.</p>
<p>Gifts are also mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. The Corinthian believers had all the gifts and did not lack in any of them (1:7). Yet, though the Corinthians had all the gifts, their spiritual condition is described as fleshly and immature (3:1). We may have the gifts yet remain childish and fleshly. There is no doubt that we can receive help from the gifts, but we need to learn something more. Signs and wisdom are gifts (1:22), but the apostle preached &ldquo;Christ crucified&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). The apostle&rsquo;s only intention was to minister Christ as power and wisdom. He had no intention to minister the manifestations of the gifts and signs. The gifts are a help, but they are not the goal and the mark. The mark is the indwelling Christ. The gifts should only help us to realize this mark.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 mentions spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues, but at the end of the chapter Paul mentions &ldquo;a most excellent way&rdquo; (v. 31). What is the most excellent way? Chapter 13 is the continuation of this verse, telling us that if we speak in all the tongues of men and angels but do not have love, we become merely sounding brass or a clanging symbol; that is, we hear only a sound without life. Love is the expression of life. This proves that, strictly, tongue-speaking is not a matter of life. To speak in tongues with no consideration of life is to become like sounding brass. Many people who speak frequently in tongues are very shallow and immature in their Christian life.</p>
<p>In chapter 14 the apostle encourages us rather to exercise our spirit for the spiritual profit of the church. This is the conclusion of the whole chapter. Even though Paul exceeded others in tongue-speaking, he said that he would rather speak five intelligible words in the church meetings than ten thousand words in a tongue (vv. 18-19). In these chapters the apostle manifests a somewhat negative attitude toward speaking in tongues. Rather than encouraging the practice of the gifts, he adjusts the Corinthians with some corrective instruction. Therefore, we must conclude that all the gifts are for the experience of Christ and must be used in proper proportion.</p>
<p>The key to God&rsquo;s economy is Christ as everything wrought into our spirit. Of course, we need certain teachings and certain gifts to help us to realize the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. But we must not allow doctrines and gifts to replace this mark. The mark of God&rsquo;s economy is neither teachings nor gifts but Christ, who is the living Spirit indwelling our spirit. With some, a gift may be needed to help them to realize this mark. Not all need the same gift. While some may need the gift of prophecy, others may need the gift of speaking in tongues. Some may need the gift of healing, and others may need certain doctrines. Many people are drawn to Christ through certain teachings. But let us be clear that the indwelling Christ in our spirit is the key to God&rsquo;s economy. We must give our full attention to this key. Actually, there is no need to give special attention to any kind of teaching or gift if the indwelling Christ is already realized in our spirit.</p>
<p>The old servant of Abraham was sent with a number of gifts to obtain a wife for Isaac. All these gifts helped Rebekah to realize that she had to go to meet Isaac (Gen. 24:10, 22, 53, 58). This is the true place of the gifts. But after Rebekah received the gifts, she seemed to forget all about them and say, &ldquo;I will go to Isaac. I will not be satisfied to remain here enjoying these gifts yet forget about Isaac. I will go on to meet my bridegroom.&rdquo; After Rebekah married Isaac, there is no further mention of these gifts. Day by day Rebekah simply enjoyed living with Isaac. Christ is much better than speaking in tongues, much better than prophecy, much better than everything else.</p>
<p>With the key to a house in my hand, I can open all the doors and enjoy the entire house. If I have no key, I will need to see a locksmith; however, if I have the key, the services of a locksmith are not required. The real need is the key, not the locksmith; moreover, just as the locksmith is not needed when I have the key, so the gifts and the teachings are not needed when we realize the indwelling Christ in our spirit.</p>
<p>Some may require certain teachings and gifts in order to find the key, but praise the Lord, as long as the key is in our hand to realize Christ, let us forget the teachings and gifts. Let us give our full attention to discerning our spirit, contacting the living Christ, and fellowshipping with Him. In order for us to obtain the key, God has apportioned certain gifts and teachings. We can praise the Lord for this mercy, but we must be careful. We must not give so much attention to the locksmith that we go to him every day. As long as we obtain the key, we can thank the locksmith and leave him. We can then use the key to come into the building and discover its riches. Day by day we need to learn to know this wonderful Triune God, the unsearchable Christ, the all-inclusive Holy Spirit, who is now in our spirit. We have the key when we discern our spirit. We have the key! Whatever we need of Christ, we have by exercising our spirit to contact Him. This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. Although the Lord grants us teachings and gifts, He Himself, the complete and all-inclusive One, is the goal. Let us not settle for anything less than Himself. The aim of God&rsquo;s economy is for the all-inclusive Christ to indwell our spirit. Throughout the day we must seek to return into our spirit, discern our spirit, and contact Christ as everything. Then we have the key to the proper and normal Christian life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PERSONS OF GOD<br />
AND THE PARTS OF MAN</h1>
<p>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them. For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. (2 Cor. 4:3-7)</p>
<p>These verses tell us that Satan, the god of this age, blinds the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ might not shine on them. The enemy is afraid of the shining of the gospel of the glory of such a Christ. <em>The gospel of the glory of Christ</em> in verse 4 corresponds to <em>the knowledge of the glory of God</em> in verse 6. The treasure in verse 7 is the very God in Christ who has shined Himself into us, the earthen vessels.</p>
<p>We have seen the economy of God and the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. We have pointed out that the main thing in the economy of God is that God intends to work Himself into us. God works Himself into our different parts through His different persons. If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that this is the main thing. I have such a burden that I could say this to the Lord&rsquo;s children hundreds of times, yes, thousands of times: in the whole universe God&rsquo;s intention is nothing other than to work Himself into man.</p>
<p>God created man for the unique purpose that man might be His container. I like to use this word <em>container</em> because it is clearer than the word vessel. Romans 9:21 and 23 and 2 Corinthians 4:7 clearly show that God created us to be His containers so that we might contain Him. We are merely empty containers, and God intends to be our only content. To illustrate, bottles are necessary to contain beverages, and light bulbs are necessary to contain electricity. If we look at the bottles made for beverages and the light bulbs made for electricity, we will realize that these &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; containers are quite specific articles; they were made for a particular use. We human beings are also &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; containers, for we too were made for a specific purpose. After being made, the light bulbs must contain electricity; otherwise, they will be meaningless and good for nothing. Likewise, if the bottles never contain a beverage, they will become meaningless. Man was made purposely to contain God. If we do not contain God and know God as our content, we are a senseless contradiction.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much education we may obtain, what kind of position we may have, or how much wealth we may possess, we are still meaningless, since we were purposely made as a container to contain God as our sole content. As containers, we must receive God into our being. Although this word may seem simple, it is the exact word needed to point out the main thought of the whole Scripture. The basic teaching of the whole Scripture is simply this: God is the very content, and we are the containers made to receive this content. We must contain God and be filled with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order that God may put Himself into us as our content, He must exist in three persons. We can never adequately understand the mystery of God&rsquo;s three persons. We are told clearly in several places in the Scriptures that God is only one God. First Corinthians 8:4 and 6 and 1 Timothy 2:5 declare this. But in the first chapter of Genesis the pronoun used for God is not the singular <em>I</em> but the plural <em>Us.</em></p>
<p>Let us read Genesis 1:26 and 27: &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...God created man in His own image.&rdquo; Verse 26 uses the plural pronoun <em>Our,</em> whereas verse 27 uses the singular pronoun <em>His.</em> Please tell me, is God singular or plural? Who can explain this? God Himself used the plural pronoun for Himself: &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image.&rdquo; But if you say that God is more than one, you are a heretic, because the Bible tells us that God is uniquely one. In the whole universe there is not more than one God. Why, then, if God is uniquely one, is the plural pronoun used?</p>
<p>Everyone who is familiar with Hebrew can tell us that the word <em>God</em> in Genesis 1 is in the plural number. The Hebrew word for <em>God</em> in verse 1 is <em>Elohim,</em> which is in the plural number. However, in Hebrew the predicate <em>created</em> is in the singular number. This is very strange. The grammatical composition of this verse contains a subject in the plural number but a verb in the singular number. No one can argue with this; it is proven by the Hebrew. Then, I ask, is God one or three?</p>
<p>Now let us read Isaiah 9:6: &ldquo;For a child is born to us, / A Son is given to us;... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; This verse does not say &ldquo;mighty man&rdquo; but &ldquo;Mighty God.&rdquo; A little child is called Mighty God. All Christians agree with the prophecy of this verse. The child mentioned here refers to the child born in the manger at Bethlehem, who is not only named Mighty God but also Eternal Father. As a child born to us, He is called Mighty God, and as a Son given to us, He is called Eternal Father. This is very strange. When the child is called Mighty God, is He a child or is He God? And when the Son is called Eternal Father, is He the Son or is He the Father? If you try to figure it out, you cannot do it. You must take it as a fact, unless, of course, you do not believe the Scriptures. If you believe the authority of the Scriptures, you must accept the fact that since the child is called Mighty God, the child <em>is</em> the Mighty God, and since the Son is called the Father, the Son <em>is</em> the Father. If the child is not the Mighty God, how could the child be called Mighty God? And if the Son is not the Father, how could the Son be called Eternal Father? In view of this, how many Gods do we have? We have only one God, because the child Jesus is the Mighty God, and the Son is the Eternal Father.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; According to our understanding, who is the Lord? We all agree that the Lord is Jesus Christ (4:5; Phil. 2:11). But 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. Who is the Spirit? We must admit that the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Son is called the Father, and the Son, who is the very Lord, is also the Spirit. This means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. We emphasize this matter because it is by His different persons that God works out His economy. Without these different persons&mdash;the person of the Father, the person of the Son, and the person of the Spirit&mdash;God could never bring Himself into us.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse does not say, &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of any one divine person,&rdquo; nor does it say, &ldquo;Into the names.&rdquo; Rather, it says, &ldquo;Into the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; What does it mean to be baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit?</p>
<p>Let me illustrate it in this way: If you buy a watermelon, your intention is to eat and digest this melon. In other words, your intention is to work this melon into you. How can this be done? First, you buy the whole melon; second, you cut it into slices; and third, before this melon enters your stomach, you chew it until it becomes juice. The sequence is: melon, slices, and finally juice. Are these three different things or one? This is an illustration of the Divine Trinity in God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Most melons are larger than our stomach. How can we swallow a large melon when our mouth is so small and our throat is so slender? Before the melon can become the proper size for us to eat, it must be cut into slices. Then, once it is eaten, it becomes juice. Are the slices not the melon? And is the juice not the melon? If we say that they are not, we must be most ignorant.</p>
<p>The Father is illustrated by the whole melon, the Son by the slices, and the Spirit by the juice. Now we can see the point: The Father is not only the Father but is also the Son, and the Son is not only the Son but is also the Spirit. In other words, the melon is also the slices to eat and the juice within us. The melon disappears after it is eaten. Originally, the melon was on the table, but after being eaten by us and our family, the melon is in the whole family.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Father is seen in the first chapters, the Son as the expression of the Father is seen in the succeeding chapters, and eventually the Spirit as the breath of the Son is seen in verse 22 of chapter 20. This one Gospel reveals the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. I would encourage you to read the entire twenty-one chapters in this book. First, this book says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (1:1, 14). This very Word, who is God Himself, one day became a man and dwelt among us&mdash;not within us but among us. Then He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He eventually died and was resurrected. This is mysterious, miraculous, and wonderful; we can never fathom it. In the evening on the day of His resurrection He came to His disciples in His resurrected body. All the doors were shut, yet He entered the room bodily and showed the disciples His hands and His side. This is incomprehensible. He came in a very miraculous and mysterious way. Finally, He breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit (20:19-22). That very breath was the Holy Spirit, like the juice of the melon.</p>
<p>From that time, I would ask you, where was Jesus in the Gospel of John? After He came to the disciples, this Gospel never mentions the ascension of Jesus to the heavens. Then where was this wonderful One at the end of this Gospel? Like the watermelon in our stomach, Jesus was within the disciples through the Spirit as the breath.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to work Himself into us by means of His three persons. There is the need of the three persons of the Godhead, for without these three persons God could never be wrought into us. In the illustration of the melon, without being cut into slices and received as juice, the watermelon could never be wrought into us. God can be wrought into us only by His three different persons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MIND, THE HEART, AND THE IMAGE</h2>
<p>Let us now turn to ourselves and consider what we are as containers. We should not think that we are simple. I believe the medical doctors can tell us that the human body is very delicate and complicated. A human being is not a simple container, like a bottle containing a beverage; on the contrary, man has many different parts. This is the reason that we must know the different parts of man as well as the three persons of God in order to hit the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy involves His three persons, and the mark of His economy involves our different parts.</p>
<p>Those who drive a car know that it is impossible to drive a car unless we know some of its parts. We must learn at least the parts that are essential to its operation. For example, we need to identify and locate such parts as the brake pedal, the gear shift, the ignition switch, etc. If we do not know the parts of a car, we will not know how to operate it. Likewise, in order for us to realize how we can contain God, we must know the different parts of our being.</p>
<p>Consider how many parts are found in a short passage in 2 Corinthians 4. In verse 4 there are the thoughts, which are related to the mind, and in verse 6 there is the heart. At least two parts, the mind and the heart, are found in this passage. Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years, and up to this very time you do not know the difference between the mind and the heart. We read in these verses that the thoughts of the mind can be blinded by the enemy, and the heart can be enlightened by the light of God. The god of this age blinds the minds of the unbelievers, but God shines His light in the hearts of the believers. Perhaps you thought that you understood this part of the Word, but you might never have considered that in this verse two parts of the human being are mentioned.</p>
<p>Before defining the mind and the heart from the Scriptures, let us use a camera as an illustration. A camera is made to take something in. To take a picture means to take something into the camera. When I visited Tokyo, I used my camera to take Tokyo in. My intention was that an image outside the camera would be brought inside the camera.</p>
<p>In order for us to take a picture into a camera, three main things are needed: a lens without, film within, and light. If we have these three things, an object can be taken into the camera. Several years ago when I was traveling on a train, I took some pictures. After the film was processed, many of the pictures were blank. What had happened? I discovered that I was in such a hurry to take the pictures that I forgot to take the cover off the lens. The lens was &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; by its cover.</p>
<p>Many times when an unbeliever comes to hear a good message of the gospel, we think, &ldquo;Tonight this man will surely be saved.&rdquo; But eventually, he is still &ldquo;blank&rdquo; because the enemy of God has blinded his mind. The mind is the understanding organ, and Satan has blinded the understanding of this listener. Regardless of how good the message is and how much he has heard, his understanding has been blinded, or covered. His mind is still a blank; nothing has been taken in.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago Brother Watchman Nee was preaching the gospel, telling people that God&rsquo;s intention is not for us to do good. Good does not mean anything to God. He stressed this point so much that it was very clear. A brother had brought a friend to the meeting, and looking at his friend from time to time during the message, he noticed that he was always nodding his head positively as if he understood. The brother was very happy, thinking that his friend was listening carefully and taking everything in. After the meeting, the brother asked his friend, &ldquo;What do you think about the message?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Yes, all religions encourage people to do good.&rdquo; However, in his message Brother Nee had stressed very clearly that God has no intention to require man to do good. This man&rsquo;s reply indicated that his understanding was blinded by the enemy. Many times we need to pray that God will bind the god of this age and bind his blinding work during a message. To pray in this way is to pray that the cover will be taken off the lens.</p>
<p>After the cover is taken off, we need the right kind of film. Without the proper film, even though the lens is right, it will not work. We cannot receive a proper picture if we are using the wrong film. The film illustrates our heart. Our mind is like the lens, and our heart is like the film. Therefore, our heart must be tuned and adjusted properly. We need the lens, and we also need the film. We need an understanding mind, and we need a receiving heart. The heart must be pure, clean, right, and adjusted.</p>
<p>Yet even if we have the lens and the film, we still need the light. We need the light to shine through the lens and onto the film. The divine light of God&rsquo;s glory shines in us to give us the image and picture of Christ. This very image of Christ is the treasure in the earthen vessels (v. 7). Through this illustration we can realize the way to deal with our mind and our heart. It is just like using a camera: we must know how to adjust the lens and how to use the film. If we do not know how to handle the lens and the film, we can never receive a proper picture.</p>
<p>Spiritual experiences are like taking pictures. We ourselves are the camera, and we must learn how to use our camera in order to receive God in Christ as the picture. It is regrettable that many dear Christians simply do not know how to handle their mind and their heart. In fact, they do not even know that they themselves are like a camera.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Christianity is not a religion that teaches people to do this and to do that. It is simply Christ Himself, the living One, being wrought into us. He is the very object, the very figure, and we are the camera. As the object, He must be wrought into us by the shining of the divine light through the lens of our mind onto the film of our heart. Day by day and moment by moment we need the divine light to shine more of the image of Christ through the understanding of our mind that we may receive Him into our heart. Therefore, we must learn how to adjust our mind and our heart.</p>
<p>Spiritual experiences are simply the pictures of Christ taken into us, the camera, and impressed upon our spiritual film. With some Christians the lens is nearly always covered, and the film is usually improperly adjusted. If you look at their &ldquo;film,&rdquo; you will find no &ldquo;picture&rdquo;; the entire film will be blank, because they have no experiences of Christ. But if the apostle Paul came and we opened his &ldquo;camera&rdquo; and took out the &ldquo;film,&rdquo; we would find that every &ldquo;photo&rdquo; is a picture full of Christ. Everything depends on how much we adjust the lens and take care of the film&mdash;that is, how much we deal with our mind and properly tune our heart. If we do this well, whenever the divine light shines in us, the image of Christ will be shined into us. We will have a beautiful picture of Christ. This is God&rsquo;s economy with its mark.</p>
<p>Now we know the importance of learning our different parts. We were made to contain God in every part. We must go on to know all our different parts&mdash;more than even our mind and our heart. In the next chapter we will consider in detail all the parts of man, and later we will consider how they function and how to adjust them.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INWARD AND THE HIDDEN PARTS</h1>
<p>Let us now go on to see the details of the vessel of the Lord. In the previous chapter we saw that we were created purposely to be God&rsquo;s containers, having God Himself as our content. For this purpose God has created us with many parts. Do not think that the term <em>parts</em> originated with me. In Jeremiah 31:33 God says, &ldquo;I will put My law in their inward parts.&rdquo; The inward parts are in our soul; they are not the outward members of our body. In the same verse God also says that He will write His law upon our heart. What, then, are the inward parts, and what is the heart?</p>
<p>If we compare Jeremiah 31:33 with the quotation in Hebrews 8:10, &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind,&rdquo; we will see a slight but important variation. Jeremiah says &ldquo;in their inward parts,&rdquo; but Hebrews renders it &ldquo;into their mind.&rdquo; This comparison proves that the mind is one of the inward parts.</p>
<p>The term <em>inward parts</em> is used in the Scriptures more than once. For example, Psalm 51:6 says, &ldquo;Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts.&rdquo; The inward parts must have truth. Besides the inward parts there is another part in this psalm called &ldquo;the hidden part&rdquo;: &ldquo;In the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me.&rdquo; According to this verse, truth is in the inward parts, and wisdom is in the hidden part. We need to find out what the inward parts and the hidden part are.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE PARTS OF MAN&mdash;SPIRIT, SOUL, BODY</h2>
<p>Some passages to which we will refer are very familiar. First Thessalonians 5:23 is a verse indicating that we are tripartite, or of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body. We can illustrate this by three concentric circles, as shown in the diagram on the next page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_4.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>Hebrews 4:12 also mentions the spirit and the soul and speaks of the dividing of these two parts. If we would know Christ and enter into Him as the good land and as the rest, we must discern the spirit from the soul. The spirit is the very place where Christ dwells in us (2 Tim. 4:22); hence, if we would know Christ in an experiential way, we must discern our human spirit from our soul. This verse mentions the difference not only between the spirit and the soul but also between the joints and the marrow of the body and between the thoughts and the intentions of the heart. The living word of God is a divider of the soul and the spirit and a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart. This proves that in order to know the Lord in a practical and real way, we must discern all these matters. What are the thoughts of the heart and the intentions of the heart? And how many parts are in the heart?</p>
<p>In Luke 1:46-47 the soul and the spirit are again distinguished.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:27 says that we must stand firm in one spirit&mdash;not the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit&mdash;and strive together with one soul. Again, this verse shows that there is a difference between the spirit and the soul.</p>
<p>Finally, Mark 12:30 says, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&rdquo; In this verse four different parts are mentioned: the heart, the soul, the mind, and the strength. If we put all these verses together, we will realize that there are quite a number of different parts within us besides the many parts of the body.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are composed of spirit, soul, and body, and Psalm 51 reveals the inward parts with the hidden part. The inward parts are the parts of the soul, which is proved by comparing Hebrews 8:10 with Jeremiah 31:33, where &ldquo;their mind&rdquo; is quoted as a variation of &ldquo;their inward parts.&rdquo; Just as the inward parts must be the parts of the soul, so the hidden part must be the spirit (1 Pet. 3:4). Of all our parts, the spirit is the most hidden one within us. This innermost part is not only hidden within our body but is even hidden within our soul. Hence, there are the outward parts of the body, the inward parts of the soul, and the hidden part of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL&mdash;<br />
MIND, WILL, AND EMOTION</h2>
<p>There are three parts to the soul and three parts to the spirit. We must discover what the three parts of both the soul and the spirit are. Furthermore, we must also define the heart. First Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are a tripartite being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;but it does not mention the heart. What is the heart, and how can we relate it to the inward parts and the hidden part?</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word proves clearly and definitely that the soul is of three parts&mdash;the mind, the will, and the emotion. The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_5.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>Proverbs 2:10 (cf. 19:2) suggests that the soul needs knowledge. Since knowledge is a function of the mind, this proves that the mind is a part of the soul. These two verses from Proverbs tell us that we need to have knowledge in our soul. Then Psalm 139:14 says that the soul knows. To know is something of the mind, which again proves that the mind is a part of the soul. Psalm 13:2 says that the soul takes counsel, or considers (ASV), which refers to the mind. Lamentations 3:20 indicates that the soul remembers. From these verses we can see that there is a part in the soul that knows, considers, and remembers. This part is the mind.</p>
<p>The second part of the soul is the will. Job 7:15 says that the soul chooses. To choose something is a decision made by the act of the will. This proves that the will must be a part of the soul. Job 6:7 says that the soul refuses. To choose and refuse are both functions of the will. First Chronicles 22:19 says, &ldquo;Set your...soul to seek.&rdquo; Just as we set our mind to think, so we set our soul to seek. This is, of course, the soul making a decision, which proves that the will must be a part of the soul. Then Numbers 30 speaks of binding one&rsquo;s soul ten times (ASV). When we read this chapter, we understand that to bind the soul is to make a decision. It is related to a vow that is made with the Lord. To make a decision to bind the soul is to make a vow to the Lord. Thus, this is proof that the will must be a part of the soul. Psalm 27:12; 41:2; and Ezekiel 16:27 (ASV) translate the Hebrew word for <em>soul</em> into &ldquo;will.&rdquo; The prayer made by the psalmist is, &ldquo;Do not give me over / To the desire (lit. soul) of my adversaries.&rdquo; This proves clearly that the will must be a part of the soul.</p>
<p>The emotion is the third part of the soul. With the emotion there are many aspects, for example, love, hatred, joy, grief, etc. All these are expressions of the emotion. References to love in relation to the soul are found in 1 Samuel 18:1 and Song of Songs 1:7. These verses show that love is in the soul, proving, therefore, that within the soul there is such an organ, or function, as the emotion. Concerning hatred, 2 Samuel 5:8, Psalm 107:18, and Ezekiel 36:5 speak of hating, loathing, and despising in relation to the soul. Since these are expressions of the emotion, these verses also prove that the emotion must be a part of the soul. As seen in Isaiah 61:10 and Psalm 86:4, exultation and rejoicing also are related to the soul. Since these are of the emotion, this again proves that the emotion is a part of the soul. Grief, another expression of the soul, is mentioned in 1 Samuel 30:6 and Judges 10:16 (ASV). First Samuel 20:4, Deuteronomy 14:26, Ezekiel 24:25, and Jeremiah 44:14 mention desire in relation to the soul. Concerning Ezekiel 24:25 and Jeremiah 44:14, the right meaning is reached when the American Standard Version is checked with Young&rsquo;s or Strong&rsquo;s Concordance. These verses show that desire, an element of the emotion, is in the realm of the soul.</p>
<p>These verses establish the ground to verify the three parts of the soul: the mind, the will, and the emotion. In the Scriptures it is difficult to find any additional parts of the soul, for these three parts cover all the functions of the soul. The mind is the leading part, followed by the will and the emotion. These are the verses that best reveal what the three parts of the soul are.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE PARTS OF THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
CONSCIENCE, FELLOWSHIP, AND INTUITION</h2>
<p>It is interesting to note that there are three persons in the Godhead, three parts to man&rsquo;s being, three inward parts to the soul, and also three parts to the spirit. All are in three parts. The Scriptures also reveal three parts in the tabernacle, the building of God. Three is the basic figure or number. Even in Noah&rsquo;s ark there were three levels. With the tabernacle the number three is used many times. For example, the width of one board was one and a half cubits. When two boards were joined as a pair, the total width was three cubits. This means that the number three signifies a whole unit.</p>
<p>Therefore, the spirit is a complete unit, composed of three parts, or functions: conscience, fellowship, and intuition. The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_6.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>It is easy to understand the conscience. We are all familiar with this. To perceive right from wrong is one function of the conscience. To condemn or to justify is another one of its functions. It is also easy to comprehend the fellowship. The fellowship is our communion with God. Within our spirit such a function makes it possible for us to contact God. In a simple word, fellowship is to touch God. But it is not easy to understand the intuition. Intuition means to have a direct sense or knowledge. There is such a direct sense in our spirit, regardless of reason, circumstances, or background. It is a sense without reason, a sense that is not &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; It is a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God. This function of the spirit is what we call the intuition. Thus, the spirit is known by the functions of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</p>
<p>But these three parts in the human spirit must be proven from the Scriptures. First of all, the conscience is found in Romans 9:1: &ldquo;My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; By comparing Romans 9:1 with Romans 8:16, it is evident that the conscience is located in the human spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&rdquo; On one hand, the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit; on the other hand, our conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit. This proves that the conscience must be a function of our spirit. In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says that in his spirit he judged a sinful person. To judge means either to condemn or to justify, which are acts of the conscience. The fact that the apostle judged in his spirit confirms that the condemning or justifying function is in the spirit; hence, the conscience is in the spirit. Psalm 51:10 speaks of &ldquo;a right spirit within me&rdquo; (ASV). A right spirit is a spirit that is right. Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience; thus, this verse also proves that the conscience is in the spirit. Psalm 34:18 refers to those who are &ldquo;contrite in spirit.&rdquo; To be contrite means to realize that we are wrong. In other words, it is to accuse and condemn ourselves, which is a function of the conscience. This shows that the conscience is related to the spirit. Deuteronomy 2:30 says that God hardened the spirit of Sihon the king of Heshbon, which means that Sihon&rsquo;s conscience was hardened. To be hardened in the spirit means to be careless with regard to the conscience. When we cast off the feeling in our conscience, we become hardened in our spirit. These verses offer the strongest ground for the fact that the function of the conscience is in the human spirit.</p>
<p>Let us go on to find the scriptural ground for saying that the fellowship is a part of the spirit. First of all, John 4:24 tells us that we must worship God in our spirit. Thus, to worship God requires us to worship in our spirit. To worship God is to contact God and fellowship with God. This verse proves that the function of worship, or of fellowship, is in our spirit. In Romans 1:9 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;I serve [God] in my spirit.&rdquo; To serve God also is a kind of fellowship with God. This too proves that the function of fellowship is in our spirit. In Romans 7:6 Paul added that &ldquo;we serve in newness of spirit.&rdquo; In other words, our service to the Lord is essentially our fellowship with the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<p>Let us consider Ephesians 6:18. In this verse Paul says that we should pray &ldquo;at every time in spirit.&rdquo; There is no article before <em>spirit,</em> nor is the word capitalized. The word <em>spirit</em> here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to our human spirit. To pray is to fellowship with God. To pray in spirit indicates, then, that fellowship with God is a matter in our spirit. In Luke 1:47 Mary said, &ldquo;My spirit has exulted in God.&rdquo; To exult in God means that the human spirit has contacted God. Once again, this verse indicates that fellowship with God is a function of the spirit. In addition, Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&rdquo; This verse is very clear, because it shows that fellowship with God must be both in our spirit and in the Spirit of God. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Real fellowship means that we become one spirit with the Lord. This fellowship is in our spirit. The above verses are sufficient to prove that the function of fellowship is in our human spirit.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the intuition. Although it is difficult to find the scriptural ground for this function, there are some verses. First Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot. Our spirit can discern that which the soul cannot discern. This proves that something extra is in our spirit. Our soul can know things by reason and by circumstantial experiences, but the human spirit can discern things without these. This direct sense in the spirit shows that the intuition is in our spirit. Furthermore, Mark 2:8 says that Jesus knew in His spirit, and Mark 8:12 says that He groaned deeply in His spirit. John 11:33 says that Jesus was moved with indignation in His spirit. To know, to groan, and to be indignant in our spirit come from a direct sense of discernment that is not dependent upon reason. This we call the intuition, the third function of our spirit.</p>
<p>Now we have the scriptural ground for these six parts: the three parts of the soul and the three parts of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR PARTS OF THE HEART&mdash;<br />
MIND, WILL, EMOTION, AND CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>What, then, is the heart? The heart is not a separate part in addition to the soul and the spirit; rather, it is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit. It includes the mind, the will, and the emotion plus one part of the spirit, the conscience. The shaded area in the following diagram illustrates the parts that compose the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_7.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="161" /></p>
<p>Man does not have more than three main parts in his being. As a human being we have a body, a soul, and a spirit. We do not have a fourth and separate part that is called the heart.</p>
<p>Now we need to confirm that the mind, the first part of the soul, is a part of the heart. In Matthew 9:4 Jesus said to the scribes, &ldquo;Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?&rdquo; This indicates that one can think in his heart. Since the thinking processes are in the mind, this proves that the mind is a part of the heart. Genesis 6:5 refers to the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart. The thoughts are of the mind, but Genesis 6:5 speaks of the thoughts as being of the heart. Hebrews 4:12 also refers to the thoughts of the heart. These three verses are ample proof that the mind, an organ of the soul, is a part of the heart.</p>
<p>Acts 11:23 refers to the will. In this verse Barnabas encouraged the believers in Antioch &ldquo;to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart.&rdquo; To purpose is a function of the will, but in Acts it is referred to as being of the heart. This shows that the will also is a part of the heart. Hebrews 4:12 speaks of the &ldquo;intentions of the heart.&rdquo; The intentions correspond to the purposes, which are of the will. Again, this proves that the will is a part of the heart. There are more verses, but these two are sufficient. According to the scriptural standard, only two witnesses are required (Deut. 19:15; John 8:17).</p>
<p>In John 16:22 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;Your heart will rejoice.&rdquo; To rejoice is an element of the emotions, but here the Lord said that the heart rejoices. This confirms that the emotion also is a part of the heart. In the same chapter the Lord said, &ldquo;Sorrow has filled your heart&rdquo; (v. 6). Sorrow also is something of the emotion. Hence, these two verses verify that the emotion is a part of the heart.</p>
<p>Concerning the conscience, Hebrews 10:22 says, &ldquo;Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo; Here we see that the conscience has much to do with the heart. In order to have a pure heart, we must have a conscience that is without offense. Our conscience must be sprinkled with the blood of Christ in order for us to have a pure heart. Thus, without a doubt, the conscience is a part of the heart. First John 3:20 says that &ldquo;our heart blames us.&rdquo; To blame is a function of the conscience. Hence, this verse proves that the conscience is a part of the heart.</p>
<p>Scriptural ground has thus been given to prove that all the parts of the soul&mdash;the mind, the will, and the emotion&mdash;and the first part of the spirit&mdash;the conscience&mdash;composed together equal the heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION OF<br />
THE INWARD AND THE HIDDEN PARTS</h1>
<p>Let us continue to see the inward parts and the hidden part of our being. We need to remember these two terms: <em>the inward parts</em> and <em>the hidden part.</em> The inward parts of our being are the parts of the soul, and the hidden part is our spirit. Both our soul and our spirit are composed of three parts, and our heart consists of the three parts of our soul combined with the first part of our spirit, which is our conscience. We must spend time to consider the details of all these parts. We must first see what the function of the heart is and how we need to deal with it. Then we must see the spirit, and finally, the soul. Let us look to the Lord that we may have grace to see all these parts clearly, that we may be sufficiently impressed to learn all the parts of our being, and that we may know how to exercise our spirit and our heart in order to experience the Lord. In this chapter we will see the functions of the heart, the spirit, and the soul.</p>
<p>According to the record of the Scriptures, the heart, not the spirit or the soul, must be dealt with first. The reason for this is that the heart is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the most important part of the spirit, the conscience. Our relationship with the Lord must start with the conscience. If our conscience is wrong, we can be sure that we are wrong both with God and with others. Therefore, since the conscience is the main part of the heart, the heart must be dealt with first to ensure a proper relationship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEART AS THE LOVING ORGAN</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; The heart must first turn to the Lord. This is real repentance. When we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but when we repented, our heart turned to the Lord. The turning of the heart to the Lord is not once and for all. The heart must be turned to the Lord all the time, day by day. Every morning we must turn our heart again toward the Lord. After rising, we should go to the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, here I am. By Your mercy and grace I wish to turn my heart anew to You for this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is gone. Many people wonder why they do not have the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and why they do not know the Lord&rsquo;s will. But the problem is, where is their heart and in what direction is their heart turned? Their heart must be turned and tuned to the Lord. When I was young, I prayed over 2 Corinthians 3:16 nearly every day: &ldquo;Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You.&rdquo; I must testify that this kind of prayer works. I encourage you to try it. Before you read the Word in the morning, you should first turn your heart to the Lord. If you do this, the veil will be gone, and there will be light. The veil between you and the Lord will be taken away by your turning your heart to Him, and you will see the light.</p>
<p>Once our heart is turned to the Lord, it must next exercise faith. Romans 10:9-10 says, &ldquo;Believe in your heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;With the heart there is believing.&rdquo; Hence, believing is not an exercise of the spirit, the mind, or the will, but an exercise of the heart. We need to learn how to exercise our heart to believe in order to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit. After our heart is turned to the Lord, we should immediately exercise faith in our heart. Whatever the Lord says in the Word, we must exercise our heart to believe. Whatever we sense deep within, we must believe by exercising our heart. We must believe in the Lord in the midst of our environment. In all the situations within our set of circumstances, we must always exercise our heart to believe the Lord. Exercising faith in the Lord will keep our heart from doubt. We must even pray that the Lord will protect our heart from doubt.</p>
<p>Third, our heart must be sprinkled from an evil conscience (Heb. 10:22). The heart itself is not to be sprinkled, but the evil conscience. Our conscience always needs the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus. The more we turn our heart to the Lord and the more we believe in the Lord by exercising our heart, the more we will feel in our conscience that we are wrong in many matters. When our heart is not turned to the Lord, we will never sense that our conscience is wrong. When our heart is turned away from the Lord, we have only one sense: that we are right in everything; everyone else is wrong, but we ourselves are right. When we turn our heart to the Lord, we can see only ourselves; we cannot see others. The more we believe in Him, the more we will sense how wrong we are in a great many things. We will sense that we are wrong with our wife, with our husband, with our children, with our parents, with our schoolmates. These accusations in our heart are the accusations of our conscience. At such a time we will spontaneously confess everything according to the inner accusation of our conscience. The more we confess, the more the blood of the Lord Jesus will be applied to our conscience. As a result, our conscience will be purged, cleansed, and without offense&mdash;a purified conscience. To have our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience means that our conscience has been so purged that there is no more condemnation in our heart. Our heart is at peace and full of joy in the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Ezekiel 36:26, the heart must be renewed. In Ezekiel 36:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.&rdquo; But this is not all. To cleanse us from all filthiness, from all sins, and even from idols is only on the negative side. We need something positive. Therefore, the next verse says, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart.&rdquo; The new heart is the old heart renewed.</p>
<p>Thus, there are four steps in dealing with the heart. These steps do not take place once and for all when we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him as our Savior. We who are seeking the Lord must have our heart refreshed by these four steps every day. We must turn our heart to the Lord, exercise our heart to believe Him, have our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience, and have it renewed again and again. The renewing of the heart is not a once and for all matter. I believe that if he were living today, the apostle Paul would still need to have his heart renewed. We need to put all these steps into practice immediately. When we first rise up in the morning, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You.&rdquo; Then we need to exercise our heart to believe the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, I believe You and Your Word. I believe in Your dealing within me and in all Your dealings in my environment.&rdquo; At this point we will sense how wrong we are, how many mistakes we have made, and how much filthiness we have. Therefore, we must confess in order to be cleansed and sprinkled from an evil conscience. Then our heart will be renewed afresh.</p>
<p>These four steps will cause our heart to function adequately. The function of the heart is to love the Lord, for the heart is the loving organ of our being. This is proven by Mark 12:30: &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart.&rdquo; The heart was created for the purpose of loving the Lord. If we do not have a heart, we cannot love. Just as we cannot see without eyes, hear without ears, or think without a mind, we cannot love without a heart. Many Christians do not know what the function of the heart is. They know the function of the eyes, the ears, and the mind, but they simply do not know the function of the heart.</p>
<p>Love is a matter of the heart. We cannot love people with our nose, nor can we love them with our hands. Our heart is the only organ by which we can exercise love. No one can say that he does not love anything. Everyone loves something&mdash;either the Lord Himself or something else. The more we turn our heart to the Lord, the more we will exercise our heart to believe the Lord, and the more our heart will be sprinkled from an evil conscience and renewed. Then it will have a greater capacity to love the Lord. This is the function of a renewed heart. Every morning we must renew our heart so that we may love the Lord more and more.</p>
<p>All spiritual experiences start with love in the heart. If we do not love the Lord, it will be impossible for us to receive any kind of spiritual experience. In fact, the first experience of our Christian life, our salvation, involves our heart loving the Lord Jesus. Not one person who truly repents is without love in his heart toward the Lord. He may not have the language to express it, but he has the sweet sense of love within. He does not have the knowledge, but his initial experience of salvation is a reaction or reflection of love in his heart toward the Lord.</p>
<p>We all must learn how to continually turn and exercise our heart in order to have our heart purged from an evil conscience and renewed again so that we may love the Lord more and more. It was the loss of its first, fresh love to the Lord that was the cause of the church&rsquo;s fall and degradation (Rev. 2:4). When our heart is not fresh in loving the Lord, we have fallen. We must turn our heart back to the Lord again and again and have it continually renewed that we may have a new and fresh love toward the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT AS THE RECEIVING ORGAN</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the function of the heart, we need to consider the function of the spirit. First of all, the Bible tells us that we were originally dead, but when we received the Lord Jesus, we were quickened and made alive (Eph. 2:1-5; Col. 2:13). What does it mean that we were dead? When I was young, I could not understand this. I said to myself, &ldquo;How can the Bible say that I am dead when I am still alive?&rdquo; Later on, of course, I learned that I was dead in my spirit. It was my spirit that was dead and out of function. The function of the spirit is to contact God, fellowship with God, and receive and worship God. But because of the fall, man&rsquo;s spirit became dormant and could not function.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Holy Spirit&mdash;and we must remind ourselves that when the title <em>Holy Spirit</em> is used, it means the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;came into our spirit and touched our spirit. By such a touch, our spirit was made alive.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by electricity. When we touch electricity, something of electricity is transmitted into us. By a simple touch electricity is transmitted. Similarly, the Holy Spirit came into our spirit to touch our spirit, and by that touch the very life that is the Lord Himself was imparted into us. Our dead, dormant spirit immediately became alive. This is more than a miracle. Many times we have thought that it would be wonderful and miraculous if a dead person were resurrected. But we must realize that the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s enlivening of our dead spirit is even more miraculous. History records that thousands and even millions of people have been rapidly changed because their dead spirit was enlivened. In just one second a person who is dead in his spirit can be made alive. The Holy Spirit is much more powerful than electricity and much faster than the transmission of electricity.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:13 and Ephesians 2:1 and 5 say that our spirit was dead and then made alive. We were dead in sins and then made alive with Christ. These two passages prove that we were originally dead in our spirit, but when we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, our dead spirit was quickened and made alive. When our spirit was made alive, it was also regenerated. The prefix <em>re-</em> in <em>regeneration</em> means &ldquo;again.&rdquo; This means not only that our spirit was made alive, but also that another life was added into our spirit. This other life is the divine and uncreated life of God. It is Christ Himself (John 11:25; 14:6). When the Holy Spirit, based upon the redeeming work of Christ, came into us, He not only enlivened our dead spirit but also brought Christ into our spirit. This new life added into our spirit is more than what God gave us at creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only has our dead spirit been recovered and made alive, but a new substance has been added into our spirit. This additional new substance, or essence, is Christ Himself. This is the new birth, regeneration. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; By the new birth, by regeneration, something other than what we originally had was added to us. We must say this again and again: something has been added. Not only has the old and the dead been renewed and made alive, but Christ Himself has been added into us as the very essence of the divine life. This is regeneration and the new life. By all this we now have a new spirit (Ezek. 36:26).</p>
<p>May I ask, &ldquo;Have you received Christ Himself as your new life?&rdquo; If you answer yes, I will ask, &ldquo;Then why are you still so poor?&rdquo; Christians need to know Christ as a living reality. Atomic power is not merely something outward but something inward. Even within a mere piece of paper there is atomic power. But when you received Christ, something more powerful than atomic power was added into your spirit. If you believe this, you need to jump up and say Hallelujah! You need to thank and praise the Lord that such a wonderful, all-inclusive, exhaustless, immeasurable Christ has actually been added into you. We simply do not have adequate words to describe the Christ who has come into us. Only eternity can tell the story.</p>
<p>But, praise Him, this is not all. Our spirit is also indwelt by the all-inclusive Holy Spirit. When we were saved, God not only renewed our heart and our spirit, but He also put His own Spirit into us (Ezek. 36:26-27; John 14:17). This wonderful Spirit dwells in our human spirit (Rom. 8:11, 16). Our spirit is the very residence of the Holy Spirit. Consider how wonderful this Spirit is. From the time of our salvation, our dead spirit has become a spirit that is enlivened, regenerated with Christ as the divine life, and indwelt by the all-inclusive Holy Spirit. We <em>now</em> have such a spirit.</p>
<p>But even this is not all. Our spirit is now joined to the Lord as one spirit. Our spirit and the Lord Himself as the Spirit are joined together as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). No human words can exhaust this mystery.</p>
<p>What is the purpose and function of the spirit? It is to contact the Lord, to receive Him, to worship God (John 4:24), and to fellowship with the divine persons of the Triune God. The heart is the loving organ, whereas the spirit is the contacting and receiving organ. We cannot love with our spirit. We must love with our heart. But the One whom our heart loves must be contacted and received by our spirit.</p>
<p>I will never forget a sister who was bothered by this kind of message. She thought that if our heart loved the Lord, it was good enough, and there was no need to talk about the spirit. She thought that the spirit and the heart were the same. Probably after hearing this kind of message, this sister did not sleep well that night, for the next morning while at breakfast she asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough that our heart loves the Lord? Why is there a need for us to talk about the spirit?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Sister, here I have a nice Bible. Do you love it?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Of course, I love it.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo; When she stretched out her hand, I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t exercise your hand. It is your heart that loves the Bible. As long as your heart loves the Bible, that is all right. There is no need to exercise your hand to take it.&rdquo; The point is clear. We cannot say that as long as our heart loves the Lord, it is good enough. Our spirit is necessary in order for us to take Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose I love my breakfast. As long as my heart loves bacon, toast, milk, juice, etc., is that enough? Absolutely not! If this were enough, I am afraid that after some days I would be buried. To love is a matter of the heart; but in order to receive something, another organ must be exercised. The organ we need to exercise depends on what we intend to receive. In order to receive food, of course, we need to exercise our mouth. In order to receive sound, we need to exercise our ears. In order to receive colorful scenery, we must exercise our eyes. Now that we love the Lord, what organ should we exercise in order to receive Him? Should we use our eyes? The more we look for the Lord, the more He will disappear. God purposely created only one organ for us to receive and contact Him. That organ is our spirit. The spirit within us has the same function spiritually as the stomach has physically. It was specifically created for the purpose of receiving God into us.</p>
<p>But before we can receive something, we must love it. No one receives anything if he does not love it first. If we do not love our breakfast, it will be rather difficult for us to receive it. This is why we must first have an appetite. When we love the Lord, we will take Him, contact Him, commune with Him, and fellowship with Him. Our heart is for us to love the Lord, but our spirit is for us to receive Him. By the renewing of our heart we have a new interest and a new desire to love the Lord. By the renewing of our spirit we have a new ability and a new capacity to receive the Lord. Therefore, after our spirit has been enlivened and Christ as life has been added to it, after it has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit and joined to the Lord as one spirit, it then becomes a very keen organ to receive and contact the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOUL AS THE REFLECTING ORGAN</h2>
<p>Next, we must deal with the soul. The first thing we must learn in dealing with the soul is to deny it. Two passages, Matthew 16:24-26 and Luke 9:23-25, tell us clearly that we need to deny our soul, which is our self. In the previous chapter we saw that the soul, our very self, is composed of three parts: the mind, the will, and the emotion. Therefore, we must learn to deny our natural mind, our natural will, and our natural emotion.</p>
<p>Second, the soul must be purified (1 Pet. 1:22), which is accomplished mainly by our receiving the word. The word of God can purify the soul from all the fleshly, worldly, and natural things. Our soul is our self, our very being, which has been extensively damaged and occupied by fleshly, worldly, and natural things. Therefore, we must first deny our soul; then, the more we deny our soul, the more it will be purified by the word of God.</p>
<p>Third, our soul must be transformed (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we must be transformed, but it does not indicate in what part we are to be transformed. However, Romans 12:2 shows that we are transformed by the renewing of the mind. Transformation, therefore, is to be accomplished in our soul, because the mind is the leading part of the soul. After our spirit has been regenerated, our soul needs to be transformed.</p>
<p>The soul must be denied, then purified, then transformed into the image of Christ, but for what purpose? We have pointed out that the purpose of the heart is to love the Lord, and the purpose of the spirit is to receive and contact the Lord. But what is the purpose of the soul? It is to reflect the Lord. In most versions the word <em>reflecting</em> is not translated in 2 Corinthians 3:18, but the meaning is in the original language. To reflect is the function of a mirror, which with &ldquo;unveiled face&rdquo; beholds and reflects. By being purified and transformed, the soul becomes the very organ, like a mirror, to reflect and express Christ. Thus, we love the Lord with our heart, we receive and contact Him with our spirit, and we reflect and express Him with our transformed soul. We must put all these things into practice in our daily life. Then our lives will verify that what has been explained here is entirely practical and really works.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">DEALING WITH THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>We have seen the definition and function of the heart, the spirit, and the soul. Our relationship with the Lord is always begun and maintained by our heart. Of course, to contact the Lord is a matter of our spirit, but this contact must be initiated and maintained by our heart, for our heart is the gateway of our whole being (Prov. 4:23). A building with many rooms always has an entrance and an exit; a person comes in by the entrance and goes out by the exit. When the entrance is closed, everyone is kept away from the rooms inside the building, but once it has been opened, people can enter the building and enjoy each room.</p>
<p>The heart is not a separate and exclusive part of our being, but is composed of all the parts of the soul and one part of the spirit. Therefore, being such a composition, the heart becomes the very gateway of our whole being. In other words, the heart becomes both the entrance and the exit of our being. Whatever enters into us must enter through the heart, and whatever comes out from us must proceed through the heart (Matt. 12:34).</p>
<p>For example, if our heart is not alert as we listen to a message, we will not receive the substance of the message. Or, when we are reading, we will receive nothing if our heart is not set on the content. Even while we are eating, if we do not have the heart to eat, we will not taste the food. This proves that the heart is the controlling organ. In order to control an entire building, we must be able either to close or open the door. With the heart there is the power to close or open our whole being.</p>
<p>For this reason the preaching of the gospel must be guided by the Holy Spirit that it might touch the human heart. The most effectual way of preaching the gospel is to touch the human heart. If one can break through the heart, many persons can be gained. This is why unbelievers harden and close their heart to the gospel preaching. Regardless of how much we preach, when they close their heart, we cannot touch them. We cannot minister anything into them, because their &ldquo;entrance&rdquo; is closed. In order to preach effectively, we must find a way to break through the entrance. The best preacher is the one who finds the key to unlock the heart.</p>
<p>Even the Lord Himself attracts us through our heart. He does not stir up our spirit first. The seeking one in the beginning of Song of Songs asks the Lord to attract her by His love so that she may love Him (1:2-4). The Lord comes to touch our heart with His love. This is why, after His resurrection, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; (John 21:15-17). The Lord&rsquo;s love is the best way to unlock the door of the heart. Therefore, the most effective way to open the heart is to preach the love of God. Once the heart is open, it is easy for the Holy Spirit to touch the spirit and all the parts of man&rsquo;s being. This is true not only in gospel preaching but even in the ministry of Christian teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE HEART</h2>
<p>We need to deal with our heart that we might have a proper relationship with the Lord. How can we deal with our heart? It is quite simple. The Scripture says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart&rdquo; (Matt. 5:8). Some translators have changed the word <em>pure</em> to <em>clean.</em> However, the word <em>clean</em> is not adequate. It is not a matter of merely having a clean heart but of having a pure heart. We may be clean but mixed and therefore not pure. To be mixed does not mean to be dirty but means to have more than one goal and one aim.</p>
<p>This is the problem with many brothers and sisters. They think that there is nothing wrong with their heart because they are clean and without condemnation. But they are not pure, because they have more than one goal, more than one aim. Yes, they are aiming at God, but at the same time they are aiming at several other things. They may be aiming at God and at a doctor&rsquo;s degree. When they have two things as their aims, they are mixed and complicated. We cannot see two things with our eyes at the same time. If we try to look at two items at the same time, both items will be blurred.</p>
<p>Why is it that some say they are not clear about the Lord&rsquo;s will? It is because they have two goals, two aims. Many brothers and sisters have more than two aims. They are aiming at many things. Yes, they are seeking the Lord, but at the same time they are seeking other things, such as their position and their career. How can they avoid being perplexed and confused? Their heart needs to be purified from many ambitions so that the Lord Himself may be their only goal.</p>
<p>Even many Christian workers have too many goals. One brother testified that he had a great goal: he wanted to be the greatest preacher in his denomination. His heart was clean, but he was not pure. His heart needed to be purified until he had only one goal&mdash;the Lord Himself. Some Christian workers have the Lord Himself and His work as their goal. Thus, they have two goals. They need to purify their heart until they seek nothing other than the Lord Himself as their goal. Their aim, their goal, and their interest should be only the Lord Himself. When they seek absolutely nothing but Him, their heart will be pure, and if they have such a pure heart, the &ldquo;sky&rdquo; will be not only open but very clear to them. Sometimes the sky is open but cloudy. The spiritual sky is cloudy because the heart is mixed and not pure. When the heart is purified from many goals, the sky is clear.</p>
<p>Another term the Bible uses to describe the heart is <em>singleness</em>&mdash;&ldquo;singleness of heart.&rdquo; Some versions translate <em>singleness</em> as <em>simplicity.</em> Singleness of heart means to be simple in heart. To be simple means, in a sense, to be foolish. Those who truly love the Lord and aim at Him are a kind of fool. We must all be Christian fools. This means that we do not know anything but Jesus. Whatever we do, we know only Jesus. Wherever we go, we know only Jesus. We should not try to be clever. We have only one way&mdash;the narrow way of Jesus. People may say, &ldquo;You are foolish,&rdquo; but we should like to be so foolish. This is simplicity.</p>
<p>Three verses in the Scriptures referring to purity of heart are Psalm 73:1, Matthew 5:8, and 2 Timothy 2:22. The latter reference shows that while the churches are deteriorating, we must pursue the Lord with a pure heart and call on the Lord together with others who have a pure heart. There are at least three verses that speak of singleness of heart: Acts 2:46, Ephesians 6:5, and Colossians 3:22. If we would seek and serve the Lord, we must deal with these two matters: being pure and single in our heart. We must learn to have not only a clean and right heart but also a pure and single heart. If we deal with our heart in such a way, our whole being will be open to the Lord, because the gateway will be open. This is not a doctrine but simply a set of instructions on how to deal with the heart so that the Lord can possess our whole being.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>To repeat, the Lord must first attract us by His love. He touches our heart with His love in order to open our heart. Immediately following the dealings with the heart, the conscience must be dealt with. The dealings in the presence of the Lord are first with the heart and then with the conscience. If we are pure and single in our heart, the function of our conscience will immediately be very keen and alert. At a certain time we may not have the sense that we are wrong and have made mistakes, but when we deal with our heart and make it pure and single, our conscience will function in a full way. Our conscience will begin to accuse us, causing us to confess and deal with our conscience. This will make our conscience without offense. Paul said that he exercised himself to always have &ldquo;a conscience without offense toward God and men&rdquo; (Acts 24:16). A conscience without offense is a conscience free from any kind of offense or accusation.</p>
<p>In order to know the difference between the soul and the spirit, we need a keen conscience. But it is difficult to have such a conscience when we reason in our mentality. A brother may say, &ldquo;I am wrong ten percent, but that brother wronged me one hundred percent. So he owes me a balance of ninety percent.&rdquo; This is nothing but mental consideration in the soul. While we are reasoning logically in our mentality, something deeper within us says, &ldquo;Regardless of how much that brother owes you, you must deal with the ten percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spiritual account is not like a bank account. An account in a bank has credit, debit, and balance, but the account in the spirit has only one column&mdash;debit. Regardless of how much credit we may have, as long as we have a debit, we must deal with it. Suppose I stole a watch from someone, and he stole a car from me. We are very clear about what we stole from each other. But one day the conscience functions, saying, &ldquo;You need to deal with that stolen article.&rdquo; Of course, if I were simply balancing a bank account, I would reason, &ldquo;The watch I stole costs one hundred dollars, and the car he stole costs two thousand dollars, so this man owes me nineteen hundred dollars. There is no need for me to deal with my conscience; rather, I should collect the balance.&rdquo; But the spiritual account does not work that way. The spiritual account demands that I forget how much the other person owes me and deal with what I stole. I must even apologize to this man: &ldquo;Sir, I am very sorry. It is sinful for me to steal. Here is the stolen watch, which I am returning to you.&rdquo; I must not say a word about the car that he stole from me. I have no right to mention it. Only the Holy Spirit has the right to say something to him. In the heavenly account there is only one column, not two.</p>
<p>Do you see the point? If you are arguing and reasoning, you are simply in the mind, not in the spirit.</p>
<p>To further illustrate, suppose the Holy Spirit is working in your spirit, demanding that you answer the call of the Lord. But many reasons flood your mind: &ldquo;How about my wife? How about my children? What about their education? I still have a mother who is eighty years old. It is better to wait a little longer. After she dies, it will be the right time for me to answer the Lord&rsquo;s call.&rdquo; This is nothing but the arguments and rationalizations in the mentality of the soul. You are quite logical, quite reasonable, quite right, but there is still the call of the Lord deep in your spirit.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand the difference between the soul and the spirit, but the problem is that our whole being may still be locked, for our heart may not yet be open. We must say this again and again: we need to open our heart. When we deal with our heart so that it is pure and single, our conscience will then be very keen to make known to us many accusations and offenses. Our conscience can be made right only by our confession and our applying the sprinkling, the cleansing, of the Lord&rsquo;s blood (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>When our conscience is purified, we will serve the living God. God is a living God, but He is not a living God to us when our conscience is full of offenses. When this is the case, we have a God in name only; but when our conscience is purified by the blood, we sense that God is living. Sometimes it seems that God is not real and living; He is merely a title, GOD, and that is all. When our conscience is dull and full of offenses, it needs to be dealt with by our confession and the purifying of the blood. Then we will have a purified conscience. An accusation in our conscience makes it impure and opaque, hindering our fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>A purified conscience, a conscience without offense, is also a good conscience (1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 1 Pet. 3:16, 21). A good conscience is a conscience that is both cleansed and purified. It is right and transparent without any shadow. A conscience in such a good condition will bring us into the presence of the Lord. If our conscience is a good conscience, there is nothing as a barrier between us and Him, because our conscience has been cleansed and purified.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul told Timothy that he served God with a pure conscience (2 Tim. 1:3). A pure conscience is a conscience purified from any mixture. It is not only a purified conscience but a conscience without any mixture and shadow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Following the dealing with the conscience, the faculty of fellowship in our spirit is dealt with, as seen in 1 John 1:1-7. Fellowship between us and God is maintained by a good conscience. When the conscience is offended, it becomes a barrier and damages our fellowship with the Lord; therefore, according to 1 John 1:9, we must confess our faults, our failures, and our sins so that the blood of the Lord Jesus might cleanse our conscience. Then there will be no condemnation in our conscience to hinder our fellowship with the Lord. Strictly speaking, our fellowship with the Lord depends on our dealing with our conscience. It is maintained through a purified conscience. Therefore, these two dealings are actually one, since to deal with our conscience is to deal with our fellowship. Fellowship will be maintained if there is nothing wrong in our conscience. If there is a break in our fellowship with the Lord, it means that our conscience is wrong. When our conscience is not purified and transparent, the fellowship is gone and can be regained only when our conscience is recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE INTUITION</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the intuition. Just as the fellowship follows the conscience, so the intuition follows the fellowship. If we are wrong in our conscience, our fellowship with the Lord is broken, and when the fellowship is broken, the intuition does not function. The dealing with the conscience is therefore very basic. A transparent conscience will bring us into the presence of the Lord, resulting in a living fellowship with Him. Through this living fellowship, it is easy for our spirit to sense the will of God directly&mdash;this is the function of the intuition. This function depends entirely on a perfect fellowship. When our fellowship is perfect, the intuition functions properly. When our fellowship with the Lord is broken, automatically the intuition ceases to work and can be recovered only through the restoration of the fellowship.</p>
<p>First John 2:27 is a very important word, which most of us neglect. It says that the anointing abides in us. The anointing is the working of the Holy Spirit within our spirit, giving us a direct sense from God. That direct sense is the intuition. First John chapter 1 indicates that the fellowship is kept, or maintained, by the blood. Chapter 2 indicates that the intuition works by the inner anointing of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit anoints us by moving in our spirit, we receive a direct sense in the intuition.</p>
<p>Through the intuition within our spirit we have an inner knowledge that is not a mental understanding. The inner knowledge is in our spirit, whereas the understanding is in our mind. The inner knowledge in our spirit always precedes the understanding in our mind. In other words, when the Holy Spirit anoints our spirit, we receive a direct sense in our intuition. Through the intuition in our spirit we have an inner knowledge by sensing something of God. But we still need our mind to understand what we sense in our spirit. Sometimes we can know something in our spirit, but we are unable to understand it in our mind. This may seem like a heavenly language, and the world does not know what we are talking about. The understanding in our mind functions only to interpret what our spirit senses as the inner knowledge. Our enlightened and renewed mind will interpret what we sense in the intuition of our spirit.</p>
<p>Let us put it in this way. Sometimes in the morning while reading the Word and praying, we spontaneously sense a burden deep in our spirit, a burden so heavy and deep that we cannot understand what it is. We need to look to the Lord for the understanding of this burden. Gradually, during the day we will begin to understand with our mind what is in our spirit. In the morning we sense the burden, or the inner knowledge, by the intuition in our spirit, but during the day we gradually receive the interpretation of this burden in our mind.</p>
<p>To summarize, 1 John 1 reveals that the fellowship must be maintained, and 1 John 2, especially verse 27, shows that the intuition must be stirred up, or anointed, by the Holy Spirit. But both the fellowship and the intuition depend entirely on our dealing with the conscience. Through such dealing we can obtain a transparent and purified conscience, which will give us a perfect fellowship with the Lord. This will result in the function of the intuition, because the Holy Spirit will then have the ground to move in and anoint our spirit. Again we say that all these things must be put into daily practice. Day by day we must deal with our heart, our conscience, our fellowship, and our intuition.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">DEALING WITH THE SOUL</h1>
<p>In the order of our dealings with the Lord, we must begin with the heart, because it is the entrance and the exit of our whole being (Prov. 4:23). Second, we must deal with the conscience, and third, with our fellowship with the Lord. By having a purified conscience, a conscience without offense, we will have a transparent fellowship with the Lord. The intuition, or the anointing, is next in order and is always based on the sprinkling of the blood. Even the Old Testament types set forth this principle. The blood always precedes the anointing (Lev. 14:14, 17). The sprinkling of the blood deals with the negative things, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit brings in the positive things, applying the very element, essence, and substance of God Himself to us. The blood washes away all that is negative, and the anointing brings in all that God is. God Himself is applied to us by the anointing. By this anointing within our spirit we receive a direct sense of God through the function of the intuition. According to our Christian experience, this is the right order: the heart, the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition. All dealings begin from our heart and continue to our spirit. Now we must proceed to consider the dealings with the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE MIND</h2>
<p>Along with the intuition in our spirit, we need our mind. The intuition gives us the sense of the inner knowledge. However, to sense the spiritual things is one thing, and to understand them is another. The things of God are sensed in the spirit, but they are understood in the mind. Many times we know something of God in our spirit, but because of a problem in our mind, we may not understand it. Sometimes it may take two or three weeks or even months before we are able to understand what we sense in our spirit. We may be aware of something, but we may not be able to interpret it. We need the understanding in our mind to interpret what is in our spirit. The things of God are sensed by the function of the intuition in our spirit, but they are understood by the function of the understanding in our mentality.</p>
<p>For this reason, we are told in Romans 12:2 that we need the renewing of the mind. But this verse first says that we are not to be fashioned according to this age. The age is the present, or modern, course of the world, the satanic system. The history of the world can be divided into successive ages, such as the first century, the second century, and so forth. We could say that each century is an age. Without the different ages, the world could not exist. Today&rsquo;s age is that part of the world system that presently surrounds us; hence, to be fashioned according to this age means to follow the present course of the world.</p>
<p>Romans 12:2 goes on to say, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; If we are occupied by the things of this age, our mind can never be renewed. This is the reason that many Christians who are genuinely saved are unable to understand spiritual things. They have been fashioned according to the modern appearance of the world. We need to give up this modern age. If we are fashioned according to this age, we can never be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</p>
<p>Since the mind is a part of the soul, it is in the soul that transformation takes place. We have been regenerated in our spirit, but now the problem is our soul. There is no doubt that we are regenerated, because the Lord is within us as our eternal life, and the Holy Spirit is dwelling in our spirit. Our spirit has been made alive and regenerated with Christ as life by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6). But what about our soul? What about our mind, our will, and our emotion? In our spirit we are entirely different from the people of the world, but I am afraid that in our mind, will, and emotion we may still be exactly the same. Regeneration has been accomplished in our spirit, but after regeneration, we still need the transformation of our soul.</p>
<p>Let us illustrate this by a few examples. Concerning the matter of clothing, many who are saved are just like the people of the world in their thinking about fashion. They dress in conformity to this modern age. They think that as long as the way they dress is not sinful, it is quite all right, but this is merely the human thought and the natural concept. If they would be transformed by the renewing of their mind, their thoughts about their manner of dress would change.</p>
<p>Concerning our spending, has the way we use our money been changed? I know the story of many Christians. After they are saved, they continue to use their money in much the same way as those in the world. Not until they love the Lord more and give the Lord more ground to work within them will they be transformed in their way of spending money.</p>
<p>In the same way, there are many young brothers studying in the colleges who have the same thoughts about their studies and their degrees as other worldly young people. But if they would give ground to the Lord and be transformed in their soul by the renewing of their mind, their mind would be changed concerning these matters. This does not mean that they would give up their studies, but that their thoughts and concepts about their studies would be entirely different. They would have another point of view from which to evaluate their studies and their degrees.</p>
<p>There should be a change in our thoughts toward almost everything. This change in our thoughts is the transformation of our soul by the renewing of our mind. We have Christ as life within our spirit, but now we need Christ to spread into the inward parts of our soul and saturate them with Himself. This will transform our soul into His very image. The image of Christ will then be reflected in our thoughts. In whatever we think and consider, our renewed mind will express the glorious image of Christ. The understanding of our mind will then be spiritual. It will be very easy for our mind to understand the things that we sense in our spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; In Romans 7 the mind is attempting to do things by its own independent effort; thus, it is always defeated. But in Romans 8 the mind cooperates with the spirit and is set on the spirit. The mind has found another law, which is more powerful and stronger than the law of sin mentioned in chapter 7 (v. 23). This new law is the law of life of the indwelling Christ in our spirit (8:2). The mind never again attempts to do things independently but sets itself on the spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The mind is set on the spirit, not on the flesh. It is one thing to renew the mind, and another to set the mind on the spirit and stand and cooperate with the spirit. The more our mind stands with our spirit, the more it will come under the control of our spirit.</p>
<p>Because the mind stands with the spirit, the spirit will rule over the mind, saturate the mind, and become the spirit of the mind. Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit (lit. The mind of the spirit)...,&rdquo; but Ephesians 4:23 says, &ldquo;...the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; When our spirit controls and saturates our mind, our spirit becomes the spirit of our mind. Let us consider the context of Ephesians 4:23. Verse 22 states that we must put off the old man, and verse 24 says that we must put on the new man. This is the work of the cross and resurrection. The putting off of the old man is the work of the cross, and the putting on of the new man is the work of resurrection. Between the work of the cross and the work of resurrection is verse 23, which says, &ldquo;Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; The renewing of the mind includes the work of the cross with resurrection. It means that our natural mind must be crossed out and renewed in resurrection. The death of the cross is not the end; rather, it is a process leading to an end, which is resurrection. The more we die through the cross, the more we will be resurrected. Not only will the negative things be put to an end, but also the way will be opened for the positive things. Death to the natural mind leads to a resurrected mind. We will then have a renewed mind in resurrection. This renewed mind is in the spirit and under the control of the spirit; it is filled with the spirit and full of the spirit. Hence, the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind. As a result, our mind will be not only a renewed mind but also a spiritual mind with spiritual understanding. It is easy for such a spiritual mind to interpret the spiritual things sensed by our intuition.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE WILL</h2>
<p>Suppose our renewed mind understands what we sense by our intuition. Then the issue is our willingness to obey what we understand. We may understand, but we may also say no to the Lord. To obey with the will is another problem. Actually, if we do not have an obedient will, it will be difficult for us to understand what is in our intuition. The Lord is very wise; He never does anything wastefully. If He knows that we have no willingness to obey, there is no need for us to receive understanding concerning His will. He will simply leave us in darkness. Why should He allow us to understand if we will not obey? Our understanding must be backed by an obedient will, a will that is ready to obey the Lord (John 7:17). When we are ready to obey, we will be able to understand.</p>
<p>For example, some have come to me with questions but without a heart to listen and understand. I realized that it would be a waste of time to talk with them. Sometimes I would ask, &ldquo;Do you really mean business? If I answer your question, will you obey?&rdquo; Their answer would usually be, &ldquo;Well, maybe, but I may not like to do it. I simply want to study and find out what is what.&rdquo; Our will must be wholly submissive, and not only submissive but also in harmony with the will of God (Luke 22:42; James 4:7; Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p>God created us with a free will. He never forces us to do anything, but always gives us the option to choose. He is great and wise, but He will never force us. If He were to use force, it would mean that He is actually small. Satan not only forces people but even seduces them. God would never do that. God says, in effect, &ldquo;If you like it, do it; if you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. If you love Me, simply do it. If you don&rsquo;t love Me, forget it. Go your own way.&rdquo; Thus, there is the need to exercise our will; otherwise, it is difficult for God to do anything. In order to exercise our will, we must make our will submissive and ready to obey all the time. We should not only submit ourselves to the will of God but also bring our will into harmony with His.</p>
<p>When our will is dealt with to such an extent, it will be transformed. It will be saturated with Christ as our life by the spreading of the Holy Spirit. Others will sense the savor and the very image of Christ in our will. Every decision we make will be an expression of Christ. This is not a supposition, nor is it merely a doctrine. Sometimes when we meet some dear ones in the Lord, we sense the savor of Christ in whatever they say, whatever they choose, and whatever they decide. This simply proves that they have been saturated with Christ by being transformed in their will and in their mind.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE EMOTION</h2>
<p>The last dealing related to the soul is with our troublesome emotion. As we all know, nearly all our troubles are related to our emotion. Our emotion must be under the control of the Holy Spirit. This is the reason that Matthew 10:37-39 exhorts us to love the Lord more than everything else. What the Lord does not allow, we should not love. The regulating of our love under the control of the Lord is the negative side. But we must also know the positive side, that is, the side of always being ready to exercise our emotion according to the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure. Many, many times our emotions have the Lord&rsquo;s permission but not His pleasure. He allows us to love something, but He is not pleased.</p>
<p>A sister once found herself in such a situation. She knew that the Lord allowed her to do certain things according to the desire of her emotion, but she realized that the Lord was not happy. She went back to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord, even though You have permitted this, I will not do it. I realize that You are not happy.&rdquo; This is very good. She experienced sweet fellowship with the Lord and was full of peace and joy. She learned the lesson of bringing her emotion entirely under the control of the Lord and His pleasure. Sometimes we can gain the Lord&rsquo;s permission to love something, but not His joy. The more we love that thing, the more we lack the joy. Finally, our loving according to our own pleasure becomes a suffering, not an enjoyment. This proves that we are wrong in our emotion. We all must learn to deal with our emotion according to the pleasure and joy of the Lord. If we do not sense the joy of the Lord in what we are seeking, we must not love it.</p>
<p>Many have heard messages from Matthew 10:37-39 exhorting them not to love their parents, their brothers and sisters, and themselves more than the Lord, but they are unable to understand what this means. It simply means that they need to love everything under the control of the Lord and with His pleasure. The Lord is not small, nor is He cruel; but we must learn that whatever we hate or love, whatever we like or dislike, must be under the permission of the Lord and with His joy. We must exercise our emotion according to the Lord&rsquo;s emotion. When our emotion is not under His emotion, we are wrong and can never have His joy. The more we go our own way, the more we will lose our joy; we will not have the sweet, tender, and deep fellowship with the Lord. Although no one can condemn us for being wrong, and we can even claim before others that we have received the Lord&rsquo;s permission, we realize that we are without His joy.</p>
<p>If our emotion is kept under the rule of the Lord with His pleasure and joy, it will be saturated with the spirit. We will then be transformed into the very image of the Lord from one degree of glory to another.</p>
<p>By dealing with our heart, conscience, fellowship, intuition, mind, will, and emotion, we will become mature and full grown, and we will have the stature of the Lord (Eph. 4:13). All we will need to do then is to wait for His coming to transfigure our body (Phil. 3:20-21). If our soul is transformed, spiritual strength and power will even now saturate our weak, mortal body when we need it (Rom. 8:11). We will not only be regenerated in our spirit and transformed in our soul, but the divine life will also saturate our mortal body in times of physical weakness. Finally, at the coming of the Lord our body will be transfigured, and our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;will be in the glorious image of the Lord. This will be the ultimate application of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, which is applied in three steps: (1) the regeneration of our spirit, (2) the transformation of our soul, and (3) the transfiguration of our body. At the present time we are in the process of transformation.</p>
<p>Our soul needs all these dealings: the dealings with the mind, with the will, and with the emotion. May the Lord help us to put these into practice. This is what the Lord&rsquo;s children need today. All the teachings and the gifts are given by the Lord for this purpose. It is only by this process that we can be the proper materials for the building of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIGGING OF OUR INWARD<br />
AND HIDDEN PARTS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will learn how to have the flow of the Spirit in our inward parts. In Numbers 20 the smitten rock, which typifies Christ as the One who was smitten and riven on the cross, flowed with living water (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Then in Numbers 21 the well dug by the people of God sprang up with water (vv. 16-18). Therefore, in these two chapters of the same book there is first a rock that had to be smitten for the living water to flow out, and then a well that had to be dug for the water to spring up.</p>
<p>If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that both the rock and the well are types of Christ, revealing Him in two different aspects. The rock typifies Christ crucified on the cross, smitten by God so that the living water, which is the Spirit of life, may flow out into us (John 19:34; 7:37-39). The well shows a different aspect. Whereas the rock is Christ crucified on the cross, the well is Christ within us (4:14). For believers it is not a matter of the rock but of the well. Christ as the rock has already accomplished His work on the cross, which issued in the water of life flowing into us; but today Christ as the well of living water springing up continuously within us is a different aspect of Christ and has much to do with the present process of digging.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is not to give further teaching but to encourage us to go to the Lord to be dug. We must not talk too much about doctrines, about circumstances, about future steps, nor about guidance concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will. We ourselves must be dug, because I believe that even up to the present moment most of us do not have the free flow of living water. Our prayers are not so free. Our testimonies are not so strong, and in many ways we have been defeated and are not so victorious. This is due to one thing: the flow of the spiritual life, or the spring of the living water, is not free within us. There is much dirt within us that must be dug out. You may ask, &ldquo;What is this dirt?&rdquo; It is the dirt in our conscience, our emotion, our will, and our mind. Our heart has much dirt that needs to be dug out, and even in our spirit there is some dirt that must be dealt with.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>By using the word <em>dirt,</em> I mean that our conscience is not purified. Perhaps at this very moment some accusations that we have not confessed to the Lord are still on our conscience. These accusations are the dirt that needs to be dug away. The reason we do not sense much liberty within is that there are accusations in our conscience. What are the accusations in your conscience? You must ask yourself this question; only you know. You know what is within you that is wrong with others. When you are not right with others, the accusations persist. When you refuse to do what the Lord demands, this becomes an accusation in your conscience. Then you wonder why you are bound and without freedom. It is simply because there is a demand of the Lord that you will not answer, and it has become an immediate accusation in your conscience. Your conscience is not free from accusation and without offense.</p>
<p>If we would experience a free, inward flow of the Spirit, our conscience must first be dealt with and purified. We can dig the dirt away only by going to the Lord several times each day. I would suggest that during this week we go to the Lord again and again, even while we are walking along the street. We need to go to the Lord in our spirit and be dug in His presence. By the help of the Holy Spirit we must dig away all the dirt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE HEART</h2>
<p>After dealing with the accusations in our conscience, we must also dig away the many things condemned by the Lord in our heart. Not many brothers and sisters have a pure heart in seeking only the Lord Himself. On one hand, many are seeking the Lord and His way, but on the other hand, they are still seeking many things other than the Lord Himself. Their heart then becomes complicated and is not free and pure. We must go to the Lord once again to dig away all the things other than Christ in our heart.</p>
<p>We may ask, &ldquo;What things need to be dug away?&rdquo; Perhaps one of the first things is our concern about the future and the leading of the Lord. We should not be bothered by this; the future is not in our hands but in the Lord&rsquo;s. In fact, we should not have any future&mdash;the Lord Himself is our only future. We do not know how &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; our heart is. Many years ago fly paper was used to catch flies, and it was very sticky. Whatever touched it stuck to it. Our heart is just like fly paper; it is very sticky. Whatever touches our heart sticks to it. These things must all be cut off. It seems that we are all seeking the Lord. Many of us are living only for the Lord and have given up our homes and our jobs. Day by day we are seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading, but we do not know how many things complicate our heart. We need to forget these things. To dig away the dirt from our conscience is easy, but to dig away the dirt from our heart is not easy. In many things we are kind to ourselves; we do not like to dig our heart severely. It is easy to dig away the accusations from our conscience, but it is not easy to dig away the things that we love from our heart. We are stuck to the things that we hold dearly. Because of this, the Scriptures tell us that we need a good conscience and a pure heart. &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo; (Matt. 5:8).</p>
<p>There is no doubt that we love the Lord and are seeking Him, but our loving and seeking the Lord are with a complicated heart. The aim and the goal of our heart are not pure. We do not know how many goals are within our heart. What about our family? Our job? Our degree? What about this year, and next year? There are many things still in our heart. All this dirt is frustrating the flow of living water within us and must be dug away. Since the day we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, He has come into us as the springing well of living water. But the problem today is that there is too much dirt in our conscience and in our heart.</p><h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE MIND</h2>
<p>When someone is digging a deep well, many times he will discover that the earth is of many layers. One layer is of soft dirt, the next layer is of hard dirt, and another layer is of stone. It is difficult to dig through a layer of stone. This illustrates the many layers in us through which we need to dig. One layer is the conscience, another layer is the heart, and now a third layer is our mind, which holds much dirt. We do not know how many imaginations we have day by day. We not only dream during the night while we are asleep, but we also dream during the day while we are awake. All our imaginations are different dreams. We have already spoken of Satan blinding our minds; he does this simply through our imaginations. Sometimes while you are listening to a message, your mind travels to the moon. Outwardly you nod your head, but inwardly your mind imagines something in space. During the message you hear the voice, but you do not receive anything. Your mind has been blinded by imaginations.</p>
<p>Many times people travel completely around the world in their imaginations. Within seconds they travel through the whole world. They can go to the Far East faster than the best jet. How many imaginations are in the mind! When there is a great deal of dirt in our mind, how can the flow of living water within us be free? Since our mind has been blocked, the living water also has been blocked in our mind. The heaps of dirt in our mind are simply the many thoughts, imaginations, and dreams, which must be dug away before the living water can freely flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE WILL</h2>
<p>The will also contains much dirt. There are not many who are absolutely and utterly obedient to the Lord. We need to be more submissive in our will. How many times we do not submit ourselves to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement! Sometimes we think we are quite submissive to the Lord, but when He puts us into certain circumstances, we are exposed. It is easy to submit to the invisible Lord, but it is rather difficult to submit to visible persons. You may say, &ldquo;I am submissive to the Lord. With the Lord I have no problem. But...&rdquo; Yes, there is a big <em>but!</em> Before the Lord you may have no problem, but concerning the saints in the church, you may not be able to submit to them. The Lord especially put you into your local church in order to break your will.</p>
<p>As a sister you may think, &ldquo;If my husband could be such a dear brother, I would gladly submit to him.&rdquo; How many times the sisters have had this thought. But the fact is that your husband cannot be that kind of person. The Lord gave you such a suitable husband; he is just the husband you need. If you could have the husband of your dreams, you would never be exposed. Many experiences and circumstances under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty simply expose us to the light so that we may know how stubborn our will is. We may point out a certain brother who is stubborn, but every one of us is stubborn. We may be the most stubborn brother or sister. Every one of us must dig his will. How easy it is to obtain more and more spiritual knowledge while we remain unchanged in our life, our nature, and our disposition. This is a situation of utter failure! If the living water is to flow in us, we must be dug. The flowing is the Lord&rsquo;s business, but the digging is our business. We need to dig ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE EMOTION</h2>
<p>After digging away the dirt from our will, we need to deal with our emotion. I do not know how to illustrate how troublesome our emotion is. This trouble exists not only with the sisters but also with the brothers. When we are emotional, we are occupied with ourselves. We are under the control and bondage of our emotions. If we would spend some time with the Lord and open ourselves, we must begin by digging our conscience, then our heart, then our mind, and then our will. Finally, we will come to the point where we see how much we are still in our emotions. It is very easy for us to like one thing and dislike another. It is very easy for us to make friends with a brother but treat him like an enemy the next morning. It is not easy to change our will, but it is easy to have many changes in our emotions. Our emotions fluctuate even more than the weather.</p>
<p>My deep concern is not merely to give a message but to afford you a little instruction so that you will go to the Lord. Forget about <em>your</em> needs, <em>your</em> job, <em>your</em> future, and <em>your</em> circumstances. Seek only the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and ask Him to bring you into His light. Then follow His light to dig away the dirt in your conscience, heart, mind, will, and emotion. The more you dig away the dirt, the more you will be alive. You will be living, you will be strengthened, and you will be victorious. This is the key to solve your many problems. You must maintain the flow of living water, that is, the fellowship of life flowing freely within you. When the living water flows freely within you, there is victory. By such a flow all the problems will be solved spontaneously and even unconsciously. Although you may not know how to solve them, they will be solved by the flowing of the living water, the fellowship of life. This flowing of the living water is entirely dependent upon your digging.</p>
<p>This digging is accomplished only by prayer. We need to spend more and more time with the Lord and pray according to His inner leading. According to that leading, we must confess and dig away all the dirt within us. I believe that these instructions are clear; now we need to practice them. Sometimes we need to pray with others, but the digging prayer is more prevailing in privacy. It is extremely necessary to spend more private time with the Lord. All the dirt within our conscience, heart, mind, will, and emotion must be dug away by our prayer. You may say, &ldquo;I am very busy.&rdquo; But although we are busy with the duties of the day, we can still touch the Lord and dig away the dirt. Many times while I am working, I apply myself to the exercise of digging. We should learn to pray, to contact the Lord, and to dig away all the inward dirt.</p>

<h1 class="title">DISCERNING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL</h1>
<p class="indent1">A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually. (1 Cor. 2:14)</p>
<p>A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring and not using his spirit. The following verse, verse 15, discloses another kind of man: &ldquo;But the spiritual man discerns all things.&rdquo; The soulish man is seen in verse 14, and the spiritual man is seen in verse 15. These verses tell us very clearly that the soulish man cannot receive the spiritual things of God. Only the spiritual man can discern them.</p>
<p class="indent1">Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life? (Matt. 16:24-26)</p>
<p>Three things are emphasized in verse 24: first, &ldquo;deny himself&rdquo;; second, &ldquo;take up his cross&rdquo;; and third, &ldquo;follow Me.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Me&rdquo; in this verse is Christ in the Holy Spirit, who now indwells us. In verses 25 and 26 the Greek word translated &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; is the word for <em>soul.</em> Hence, these two verses can be rendered, &ldquo;Whoever wants to save his soul shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul for My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&rdquo; We must lose our soul. In other words, we must deny the self.</p>
<p class="indent1">He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it. For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? (Luke 9:23-25)</p>
<p>In verse 23 Luke adds a word that is not found in Matthew 16:24&mdash;the word <em>daily,</em> indicating that we must take up our cross daily. Furthermore, Luke 9:25 says, &ldquo;forfeits himself,&rdquo; whereas Matthew 16:26 says, &ldquo;forfeits his soul-life.&rdquo; This proves, therefore, that the soul-life, or the soul, is the self.</p>
<p class="indent1">Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. (Gal. 6:1)</p>
<p class="indent1">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. (v. 18)</p>
<p class="indent1">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. (Philem. 25)</p>
<p>The first of these three verses speaks of &ldquo;a spirit of meekness,&rdquo; and the latter two, of &ldquo;your spirit.&rdquo; The spirit referred to in all three verses is the human spirit.</p>
<p class="indent1">But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness. (Rom. 8:10)</p>
<p class="indent1">That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. (v. 4)</p>
<p class="indent1">But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire. (Gal. 5:16-17)</p>
<p>In the two verses quoted from Romans, the word <em>spirit</em> refers to the human spirit. According to the context of Galatians 5, the word <em>Spirit</em> in verses 16 and 17 refers to the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVIEWING GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I wish to point out God&rsquo;s economy and its mark again. We have seen clearly in the previous few chapters that God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into us. The way God dispenses Himself into us is by the Father being embodied in the Son and the Son being realized in the Spirit. In other words, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Spirit. Not only the person of the Son is in the Holy Spirit; the accomplished work of the Son also is in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit includes God the Father, God the Son, the divine nature and the human nature, the human life of Christ with the enduring power of His earthly sufferings, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christ&rsquo;s ascension, and the enthronement of Christ. All these elements are combined together as an &ldquo;all-inclusive dose&rdquo; in the Holy Spirit. It is through this all-sufficient Holy Spirit that the fullness of the Triune God has been dispensed into us.</p>
<p>This all-inclusive Spirit is now in our human spirit. In the types of the tabernacle and the temple there were three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In this Old Testament figure the shekinah glory of God and the Ark are clearly shown to be in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 40:20-21, 34; 1 Kings 8:6, 11). Therefore, God&rsquo;s presence and Christ are neither in the outer court nor in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies. The three parts of the tabernacle and the temple correspond to the three parts of man&mdash;the body, the soul, and the spirit. The New Testament declares that we are the temple of God and that Christ is with our spirit (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). There are two verses that prove that the Holy Spirit today is working with our spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Himself is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), each one of us has a spirit, and these two spirits are mingled as one spirit. This proves that the Lord today dwells in our spirit. If we desire to enjoy Christ fully, we must know how to discern our spirit. For this very reason Hebrews 4:12 tells us that our spirit must be divided from our soul. Hebrews also tells us to enter the Holy of Holies, which is our human spirit (10:19, 22). If Christ is to be enjoyed as our divine portion, we must know how to enter into this holiest place, our human spirit.</p>
<p>In the past centuries a number of books have been written concerning the book of Hebrews. We believe that the best book was written by Andrew Murray, who entitled his book <em>The Holiest of All.</em> The title is correct, for Hebrews reveals how we may enter the Holy of Holies, the human spirit, where Christ dwells. It is in our spirit that Christ is everything to us.</p>
<p>If we desire to partake of Christ, we need to locate Him. You may say that He is in heaven. Without a doubt, that is right, but if He is only in heaven, how could He be enjoyed here on earth? Praise the Lord, He is not only in heaven; at the same time He is also within us. The electricity in our home is the same as the electricity in the generator far away from our home. In like manner, Romans 8:34 says that Christ is in heaven at the right hand of God, but the same chapter says that Christ is in us (v. 10). Thus, the Christ who is in heaven is also in us. If He were only in heaven and not in us, how could we experience and enjoy Him? Praise the Lord, today Christ is not only in heaven but also in our spirit!</p>
<p>Christ in our spirit is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into man as the all-inclusive Triune God, and the mark of His economy is the indwelling Christ in our spirit. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we meet Christ. Again using electricity as an illustration, if electricity has been installed in my house and I wish to use it, what should I do? The answer, of course, is that I should simply turn on the switch. The switch in our being is our human spirit. Many Christians can recite John 3:16, but they are ignorant of 2 Timothy 4:22&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo;&mdash;which is just as important as John 3:16. God so loved us that He gave His only begotten Son, and we have received Him (1:12). We have believed into Him and received Him, but where is He? Into what part of us has He come? For many years we had Christ as the treasure within us, but we were ignorant of the fact that He was in our spirit. But now, praise Him, we know where Christ is. Christ, the only begotten Son of God, is in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">DENYING THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Although the Lord is in our spirit, our spirit is very much stuck to our soul. This is why the writer of Hebrews tells us that our spirit must be divided from our soul by the word of God (4:12). Just as marrow is encased within a bone and the bone must be broken before the marrow can be seen, so our spirit, where Christ dwells, is so much sealed within our soul that our soul must be broken before our spirit can be revealed. For this reason the Lord told us many times that we need to lose our soul and deny our self. In all four Gospels the Lord Jesus exhorts us to lose the soul, forfeit the soul, and deny the self. The soul must be denied because it has covered up the spirit. There is only one way to get to the marrow&mdash;by breaking and crushing the bones and the joints. The Lord is in our spirit, and His grace is in our spirit, but the way for us to contact Him is by crushing our soul day by day.</p>
<p>As we have already pointed out, the soul is simply the self. The self is the very center of the human being and is the human being. It is the self that must be crossed out. We should not cross out others and put others on the cross; rather, we should put our own soul on the cross. If any man intends to follow Christ, he must deny his soulish life and take up his cross daily. Not only yesterday or only today, but day by day, we need to apply the cross to our soul. When we contact many Christians, we touch nothing but their ego. From the first word to the last, with them it is always I...I...I. But the Christian life is &ldquo;no longer I who live, but...Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). How can it be &ldquo;no longer I but Christ&rdquo;? By having the &ldquo;I&rdquo; crucified. I have been put on the cross, and the cross is now on me. I have been crossed out; thus, it is no longer I. Whenever I conversed with someone as a young Christian, I was in the habit of using the word <em>I.</em> But in these days I dare not use the word <em>I,</em> but instead, I always use <em>we.</em> The Christian life is not an individual life but a life that involves many others, including Christ.</p>
<p>If any man would follow Christ, he must do three things: deny the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; take up his cross daily, and follow Christ, who now is not only in heaven but also in us. It is easy to follow Christ when first we deny the self and apply the cross. To deny the self, that is, the soul, means that we turn from our self to our spirit. Then in our spirit we will meet Christ. Why do the four Gospels tell us negatively to deny our soul, whereas later all the Epistles tell us positively to live and do things in our spirit? The reason is that today the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, and His grace also is in our spirit (Gal. 6:18; Philem. 25). To follow Christ is a matter of dealing with our spirit, and this is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. How we need to stress again and again this mark of God&rsquo;s economy! We all must be clear that God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to dispense Himself into our spirit. He has done this already, for He is now in our spirit to be our life and our everything. All our needs are met in the wonderful Spirit who is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After we were saved, we were given too much religious teaching. We were taught many things: that God is the Creator and we are the creatures; that we need to fear God, serve Him, and please Him; that we must try our best to do good; and that we need to do something to glorify His name. These were the kinds of teachings we received. There is nothing wrong with these religious teachings; in a sense, they are good. But they are not related to the mark of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Many of us have also received ethical teachings. We were taught that we need to be good, humble, patient, nice, and loving, that we must not lose our temper, that we need to honor our parents, and that husbands must love their wives and wives must submit to their husbands. These are good, ethical teachings.</p>
<p>Instead of giving us religious and ethical teachings, the Lord told us to abide in Him. In John 15:4-5 He told us to abide in Him and that He would abide in us, that He is the vine and we are the branches, and that as the branches, we need to abide in Him. We must forget about religious and ethical teachings. We should remember one thing: we are branches of Christ. Thus, we need to abide in Him and allow Him to abide in us. However, in order to abide in Christ, we must know where Christ is. If we desire to abide in a certain house, we must first know where the house is located. Can we abide in Christ by abiding in our mind or in our emotion? No, we can abide in Christ only by abiding in our spirit. The Lord Himself and His grace are in our spirit. Thus, in order to abide in Christ, we must discern our spirit. When we abide in Christ in our spirit, He will have the opportunity to take possession of us. He will have the ground to fill and occupy us. All His riches will be wrought out through our spirit, and we will bear fruit to glorify Him. This is not a religious or ethical teaching; this is life in Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is not to give teachings or to cause us to be more religious and ethical. On the contrary, it is to help us realize God&rsquo;s eternal purpose of dispensing Himself into us as our unique portion, as our life and as our everything. Let us henceforth live by Him and enjoy Him as our all. The key, that is, the mark, is in our spirit. Such a wonderful all-inclusive, unlimited God has limited Himself to dwell in our spirit. How small and how limited we are; yet God is within us, dwelling in our spirit. This is not a matter of teaching someone to be religious or ethical; it is a matter of the Triune God becoming everything to us in our spirit. Therefore, we must learn to discern our spirit, deny our soul constantly, and turn continually to our spirit. We must forget our surroundings and abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then fruit will become the outward expression of the inner life, which is Christ Himself in our spirit.</p>
<p>The religious way for us to be a Christian is to rise up early in the morning and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for this new day. Help me today to do what is right and not to do anything wrong. Help me today to glorify Your name and do Your will. Lord, You know that my temper is not good. Help me not to lose my temper. Lord, how good it is to be patient and humble. O Lord, help me to be patient and humble.&rdquo; Perhaps we have never prayed exactly in this way, but in principle this is just the way we have prayed. This is not a spiritual prayer but a religious, ethical prayer. You may ask me, &ldquo;How, then, should I pray in the morning?&rdquo; I would suggest that you say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. You are the wonderful One with the Father in the Spirit. How glorious it is that Your Spirit is in my spirit! Lord, I look to You; I behold You; I worship You. I thank You and praise You. I fellowship with You.&rdquo; Forget about being religious and doing good. For the whole day you will be in the heavenlies. There is no need for you to think, &ldquo;Be careful, don&rsquo;t rush, don&rsquo;t lose your temper.&rdquo; You simply need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I do not know any temper, any humility, any patience, any this or that; I know only You, the glorious Christ, the all-inclusive Christ.&rdquo; Fellowship with Him, praise Him, and sing Hallelujahs. If you do this, you will see the victory. When you come to the church meeting in the evening, you will be in the heavenlies. It will be very easy for you to release your spirit and release the spirit of others. This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Make it your responsibility not to miss the mark. I have presented to you a map with clear instructions. There is no need for you to miss the way. Why should you stick to a &ldquo;mule wagon&rdquo; when today you have a &ldquo;jet,&rdquo; and not merely a &ldquo;jet&rdquo; but a &ldquo;rocket&rdquo;? I wish to tell you where the &ldquo;rocket&rdquo; is&mdash;it is in your spirit. When you turn to your spirit, it is much better than being in a new Ford. It is like being in a jet. And sometimes, in the morning, it is just like being in a rocket. You feel as if you are in the third heaven, transcendent over everything. This is not a joke. A real Christian should have such wonderful experiences of Christ as these. When you cannot endure a difficult situation and the suppression is beyond your strength, turn to your spirit and look unto Jesus. You will rise far above your situation and will be transcendent and victorious. Everything will be under your feet.</p>
<p>Many times I have been in trouble, not knowing what to do or what decision to make. The more I analyzed the situation, the more confused and complicated I became. Then I said, &ldquo;Lord, I would forget all this. I would come back to my spirit and look to You.&rdquo; When we do this, the enlightening is glorious. The all-inclusive One is in our spirit. &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo;&mdash;this is the secret. When we discern the spirit, we can abide in Him and find that He is the all-inclusive Triune God. He is the wonderful, all-inclusive, all-sufficient Spirit indwelling our spirit. Whenever we return to our spirit to contact Him, we are in the light, we are in the divine life, we are in the divine power, we are in the heavenlies, we are with the Triune God, and the Triune God is with us. How glorious! This is not merely a teaching but a genuine testimony of what I enjoy and experience again and again. We must learn to aim at the goal of God&rsquo;s economy and never swerve away. We must always keep to this mark to fellowship with Him, look to Him, and behold and reflect Him day by day by denying our soul and exercising our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MAN AND THE TWO TREES</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan, God&rsquo;s economy, is revealed to us throughout the sixty-six books of the Scriptures. At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the creation for the purpose of expressing Himself (Gen. 1:26-27). In His economy God intended that man should express Him as the center of the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN NEUTRAL BETWEEN THE TWO TREES</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the Word of God we are shown two trees&mdash;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (2:8-9). In order to understand God&rsquo;s plan in the Scriptures, we must be thoroughly clear concerning these two trees and what they represent. After God created man, He placed him before these two trees, and man&rsquo;s whole life and walk were portrayed as being a matter of feasting on one tree or the other. God instructed man to be very careful concerning his partaking of these two trees. If man dealt with these trees in a proper way, he would have life; otherwise, he would have death. It was a matter of life or death. How man would live and walk after he was created depended entirely upon how he dealt with these two trees. God instructed man clearly: if he partook of the second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would have death, but if he partook of the first tree, the tree of life, he would have life (vv. 16-17).</p>
<p>What do these two trees signify? According to the revelation of the whole Scripture, the tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as our life. The tree of life stands as a symbol of the life of God in Christ. The Old Testament and the New Testament present the Lord Jesus a number of times as either a tree or a branch of a tree (S. S. 2:3; 5:15; Isa. 11:1; John 15:1; Rev. 22:2). The Lord has the special title of <em>the Shoot</em> in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah. Many kinds of trees are used in the Scriptures to signify that Christ is our portion and our enjoyment. For instance, in Song of Songs 2 the Lord Jesus is likened to an apple tree: &ldquo;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: / In his shade I delighted and sat down&rdquo; (v. 3). We can sit in the shade of Christ as the apple tree&mdash;under His covering and in His shadow&mdash;and enjoy all His riches&mdash;the fruit of the tree. Another example of Christ as a tree is the vine tree in John 15 (vv. 1, 4).</p>
<p>What is the significance of the second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? This tree represents nothing other than Satan, the source of death. The second tree brings death, because it is the very source of death. The first tree is the source of life, and the second tree is the source of death. In the whole universe only God Himself is the source of life, and only Satan is the source of death. A verse showing that God Himself is the very source of life is Psalm 36:9, which says, &ldquo;With You is the fountain of life,&rdquo; and a verse showing that Satan is the source of death is Hebrews 2:14, which refers to Satan as &ldquo;him who has the might of death.&rdquo; The might of death is in the hand of Satan. Thus, from the very beginning of time these two trees represent two sources&mdash;one, the source of life, and the other, the source of death.</p>
<p>In the beginning there were three parties&mdash;God, man, and Satan. Man in the stage of his innocence, as he was created by God, was neutral in relation to life and death. Since it was possible for man to have either life or death, he was standing on neutral ground. God was standing on the ground of life, and Satan, on the ground of death. Man was created neutral in relation to God and Satan. It was God&rsquo;s intention for this neutral, innocent man to take God into him, that God and man, man and God, might be mingled together as one. As a result, man would contain God as his life and express God as his everything. Created man, as the center of the universe, would then fulfill the purpose of fully expressing God. Another possibility, however, was that man would be induced to take the second tree, which is the source of death. As a consequence, man would be mingled with the second tree. Oh, that our eyes might be opened to see that in the whole universe it is not a matter of ethics and of doing good, but a matter of receiving either God as life or Satan as death. We must be delivered from the ethical and moral understanding. It is not a matter of doing good or evil, but of receiving God as life or Satan as death. It is important that we clearly see the three parties. God, standing on one side, is the source of life, as represented by the tree of life; Satan, standing on the other side, is the source of death, as represented by the tree of knowledge; and Adam, standing in the middle, is neutral with two receiving hands. He can take either God at his right hand or Satan at his left.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN CORRUPTED BY THE TREE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>As we know, Adam was induced to take the second source, the tree of knowledge, into himself. This was not a matter of merely doing something wrong. It was much more serious than transgressing God&rsquo;s law and regulation. The significance of Adam&rsquo;s taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge was that he received Satan into him. Adam did not take a branch of that tree; he took the fruit of the tree. The fruit contains the reproducing power of life. For example, when the fruit of a peach tree is planted in the earth, soon another little peach tree will sprout up. Adam was the &ldquo;earth.&rdquo; When he took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into himself as the earth, he received Satan, who then grew in him. This is not a small matter. Not many Christians have realized the fall of Adam in such a way. The fruit of Satan was sown in Adam as a seed is sown in the soil; thus, Satan grew in Adam and became a part of him.</p>
<p>Now we need to discover into what part of Adam Satan was received. Satan not only came into Adam when he fell in the garden, but he still remains in the human race today. Where is he located in the human race? As we have seen in these chapters, we are a tripartite being composed of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). When Adam took the fruit of the tree of knowledge, into what part of his being did it come? Of course, it came into his body, because he received the fruit by eating it. Although this is logical and reasonable, we need scriptural ground to confirm that something of Satan is in our body. Romans 7:23 says, &ldquo;I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.&rdquo; The words <em>different law</em> refer to a law of a different category, a law of a contrasting category. The word <em>members</em> denotes the parts of the body. This verse says that the &ldquo;different law&rdquo; in our members makes us a captive to the law of sin which is in our members, that is, in the parts of our body.</p>
<p>What is the law of sin? In Romans 7:20 Paul said, &ldquo;It is no longer I...but sin that dwells in me,&rdquo; and in Galatians 2:20 he said, &ldquo;It is no longer I...but...Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Here we have a contrast between &ldquo;no longer I but sin&rdquo; and &ldquo;no longer I but Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the embodiment of God, and sin is the embodiment of Satan. Sin in Romans 7 is personified. It is like a person, for sin can dwell in us and force us to do things against our will (vv. 17, 20). It is stronger than we are. Romans 6:14 says, &ldquo;Sin will not lord it over you.&rdquo; Sin can lord it over us; hence, sin must be the evil one, Satan. Through the fall Satan came into man as sin, and he is ruling, damaging, corrupting, and mastering man. According to Romans 7, Satan as sin is in the members of man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s body as originally created by God was very good, but it has now become the flesh. The body was pure, since it was created good, but when the body was corrupted by Satan, it became the flesh. Paul said, &ldquo;In me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells&rdquo; (v. 18). Through the fall Satan came to dwell in our body, causing our body to become the flesh&mdash;a damaged, ruined body.</p>
<p>The book of Romans uses two terms: <em>the body of sin</em> (6:6) and <em>the body of this death</em> (7:24). The body is called &ldquo;the body of sin&rdquo; because sin is in the body. The body became the residence of sin, which is the embodiment of Satan. What, then, is the body of death? The source and might of death is Satan. Sin is the embodiment of Satan, and death is the issue, or effect, of Satan. The corrupted, transmuted body is called &ldquo;the body of sin&rdquo; and &ldquo;the body of this death&rdquo; because this body became the very residence of Satan. Both sin and death are related to Satan. <em>The body of sin</em> means that the body is sinful, corrupted, and enslaved by sin; <em>the body of this death</em> means that the body is weakened and full of death. The body is satanic and devilish because Satan dwells in the body. All the lusts are in this corrupted body, which is called the flesh. The Word reveals that these lusts are &ldquo;the lust of the flesh&rdquo; (Gal. 5:16). The flesh is the corrupted body that is indwelt by Satan and is full of lusts. Now we can see that the fall of man was not merely a matter of man transgressing against God, but a matter of man receiving Satan into his body. Satan, from the time of the fall, dwells in man. This is what happened when man partook of the second tree.</p>
<p>Since Satan and man became one through the second tree, Satan is no longer outside of man but is in man. The ruler of the authority of the air, Satan himself, is operating in the disobedient people (Eph. 2:2). After the fall of man, Satan was joyful, boasting that he had succeeded in taking over man. But God, who was still outside of man, seemed to say, &ldquo;I too will become incarnated. Since Satan wrought himself into man, let Me enter man and put man upon Myself.&rdquo; Do you see the complicated situation? God put on this man&mdash;Satan being in him&mdash;through incarnation. When God became incarnated as a man, the kind of man He put on was a man corrupted by Satan. At the time of God&rsquo;s incarnation, man was no longer a pure man but a man ruined and corrupted by Satan. Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin...&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus was incarnated in the flesh, He was &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin.&rdquo; There was no sin within Him (2 Cor. 5:21), but there was &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin.&rdquo; Sin was within corrupted man, but there was no sin within the Lord Jesus; there was only the likeness of the flesh of sin. The Old Testament illustrates this in the type of the bronze serpent lifted up on the pole (Num. 21:9). That serpent, made of bronze, was a type of Christ (John 3:14). When Christ was on the cross, He was a man in the likeness of the serpent. The serpent is Satan, the devil, the enemy of God, but when Christ was incarnated as a man, He had the likeness of the sinful flesh, which is the likeness of Satan. It is rather difficult for anyone to understand this easily. It is quite complicated. To repeat, man was created pure, but one day Satan came into man to possess him. Satan was joyful, thinking he had succeeded in taking over man. Then God put upon Himself the man who had Satan within him.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN RELEASED FROM THE TREE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>After God became a man and put that man with Satan within him upon Himself, He brought that man to the cross. Satan thought he had succeeded, but he only gave the Lord an easy way to put him to death. A mouse that is loose in a house is rather difficult for the owner to catch. But if the owner sets a trap with a little bait, the mouse will then be tempted to seize the bait. The mouse at first will think that it has succeeded in getting the bait, but it will not realize that it has been trapped until it is too late. Once the mouse is trapped, it is easy for the owner of the house to come and put it to death. Like a trap set to catch a mouse, Adam became a trap to catch Satan. Satan was the &ldquo;naughty mouse&rdquo; running loose in the universe. When Satan came to possess man, he thought he was successful, but he did not realize that he had fallen into a trap. Satan thought that man was his home, but he did not know that man was a trap. He thought man was his food, but man was only the bait. By seizing man, Satan was caught and imprisoned in man. Subsequently, the Lord came and put man upon Himself to bring him to the cross, that &ldquo;through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo; (Heb. 2:14). Man was the trap, and the devil was trapped in him. Through incarnation God put the corrupted man upon Himself and brought this man to death on the cross. At the same time, Satan within this fallen man was put to death also. Thus, it is by His death on the cross that Christ destroyed the devil. This is the reason that Satan is afraid of the cross, and this is the reason the Lord told us to take up the cross. The cross is the only weapon by which we can overcome Satan.</p>
<p>Where is Satan? Satan is in us&mdash;in our flesh. But where is our flesh now? Galatians 5:24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Our flesh, with Satan in it, is on the cross; thus, Satan has been put to death on the cross. For this we must praise the Lord. But is this the end? No, burial follows death. But even the grave is not the end. After burial, there was resurrection. Israel went into the Red Sea with Pharaoh and his army, but they were resurrected from the death water without Pharaoh and his army. Pharaoh and his army were buried in the death water of the Red Sea (Exo. 14:22-30). Christ brought man with Satan into death and the grave and brought man without Satan out of death and the grave. He left Satan buried in the grave. Now this resurrected man is one with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN RESURRECTED BY THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Let me ask, when was it that we were regenerated? We may think that we were regenerated in a certain year after our birth, but that is too late. Actually, we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3). When Christ was resurrected, we who believe in Him also were resurrected. This can be proven by Ephesians 2:5 and 6, which say that God &ldquo;made us alive together with Christ...and raised us up together with Him.&rdquo; At the time when Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected with Him. We must be deeply impressed with this. Man was ruined by Satan when Satan came into him. But God, through incarnation, put this man, with Satan in him, upon Himself, brought this man to the cross, put this man, including Satan, to death, and buried this man in the grave. He then brought man into resurrection, and through this resurrection man and God became one. Through incarnation God came into man, and through resurrection man and God became one. Now God is in man&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>We need to be joyful&mdash;but not overly joyful. Why? Because we must always bear the cross daily. Whenever our flesh is away from the cross, we will find that Satan is alive again. We need to say Hallelujah, because the Lord Jesus is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), but we must also be on the alert, for we are still in this flesh. When the flesh comes down off the cross, the devil is alive again. This is the reason that we must live in the spirit all the time and apply the cross to the flesh. Though Satan by the fall entered into man, he was dealt with by the Lord, and now through His resurrection the Lord is within us (cf. John 20:22). From now on our responsibility and business are not to try to do anything good. Good will only deceive and blind us. We must simply follow the Lord in our spirit and apply the cross to the flesh. This will spontaneously put Satan to death. We must learn to practice this one thing with these two aspects: follow the Lord in our spirit and put the flesh, including Satan, to death on the cross.</p>
<p>What will be the ultimate issue of this? On the one hand, there will be the New Jerusalem, and on the other hand, there will be the lake of fire. The New Jerusalem is the Triune God mingled with the resurrected man, and the lake of fire is Satan&rsquo;s ultimate destruction. The lake of fire is the place for Satan (Matt. 25:41b). All that is not related to the Triune God and the resurrected man will be put into the lake of fire with Satan (v. 41a; Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14-15). There will be only one tree in the New Jerusalem&mdash;the tree of life (22:2). The other tree will be in the lake of fire. This is the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures. The Scriptures began with three parties, but the ultimate consummation will be the New Jerusalem with only the first tree at the center of the city and the resurrected man as the expression of the Triune God. The second tree will be cast into the lake of fire. All things and all people related to the second tree will have the same destiny as Satan&mdash;the lake of fire.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the meaning of this picture to us today is that the normal Christian life does not consist of doing good. The normal Christian life is simply to take Christ and live by Christ and put the flesh with Satan to death all the time. It is to follow Christ in our spirit and to put our flesh to death. Through our living such a life, the day will come when the Triune God and the resurrected man will be one expression&mdash;the New Jerusalem, with the tree of life as its center.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND THE SOUL-LIFE</h1>
<p>These chapters deal with the basic things of God&rsquo;s economy and its mark. We are not touching here on some unimportant teachings, but on the basic things of God&rsquo;s economy, and we are touching these things not merely in the way of doctrine but in the way of experience. God in His economy intends to dispense Himself into us. He has already accomplished this by dispensing Himself into our human spirit. The Triune God has been dispensed into us. It is for this purpose that God created us with three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. This tripartite being is God&rsquo;s temple. In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s temple consisted of three parts&mdash;the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies, the very place where God&rsquo;s shekinah glory and God&rsquo;s Ark dwelt. The three parts of our being correspond exactly with the three parts of the temple&mdash;the body corresponds with the outer court, the soul with the Holy Place, and the spirit with the Holy of Holies. Today God in Christ is dwelling in our spirit, the Holy of Holies within our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD SPREADING WITHIN MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into our spirit as His abode and to take His residence in our spirit as a base to spread Himself through our whole being. Our spirit is God&rsquo;s home, His dwelling place, His habitation, the very place from which He spreads Himself through our whole being (Eph. 2:22). By spreading Himself within us, He saturates every part of our being with Himself. First, He thoroughly mingles Himself with our spirit, then with our soul, and finally with our body. He comes into our spirit to begin the mingling by regenerating our spirit. Regeneration is the mingling of God Himself with our spirit. After our regeneration, if we cooperate with Him, offering ourselves to Him and giving Him the opportunity, He will spread Himself from our spirit into our soul to renew all the parts of our soul. This is His transforming work (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Through transformation the very essence of the Triune God is mingled with our soul, our very self. When our soul is transformed into the image of the Lord, our thoughts, our desires, and our decisions will always express the Lord.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s first step, therefore, is to regenerate our spirit; His second step is to transform our soul; and finally, His last step is to transfigure, or change, our body at the second coming of the Lord (Phil. 3:21; 1 Cor. 15:51-53). The Lord will then permeate our body, and His glory will saturate our whole being. This transfiguration is the ultimate consummation of His mingling with our being to the uttermost. At that time God&rsquo;s economy of dispensing Himself into us will be fully accomplished. We need to remember these three steps by which God mingles Himself with us in every way. The following hymn expresses the final consummation.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the hope of glory, my very life is He,<br />
He has regenerated and saturated me;<br />
He comes to change my body by His subduing might<br />
Like to His glorious body in glory bright!</p>
<p class="hbody2">He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!<br />
My body He&rsquo;ll transfigure, like His own it then will be.<br />
He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!<br />
As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the hope of glory, He is God&rsquo;s mystery;<br />
He shares with me God&rsquo;s fulness and brings God into me.<br />
He comes to make me blended with God in every way,<br />
That I may share His glory with Him for aye.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the hope of glory, redemption full is He:<br />
Redemption to my body, from death to set it free,<br />
He comes to make my body a glorious one to be<br />
And swallow death forever in victory.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the hope of glory, He is my history:<br />
His life is my experience, for He is one with me;<br />
He comes to bring me into His glorious liberty,<br />
That one with Him completely I&rsquo;ll ever be.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #949</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO PARTIES FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL</h2>
<p>We all know the sad story. Before the glorious God came into man&rsquo;s spirit, Satan, the enemy of God, came into man first. The devil came into the human body through Adam when he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Consequently, sin, personified as a person, is dwelling in the members of our body and rules as an illegal master, forcing us to do things that we dislike. This is the sin mentioned in Romans 6, 7, and 8. This sin is none other than Satan, the evil, sinful one in the universe. He is the enemy of God. When he came into our body, our body was transmuted, or changed in nature, and thus became the flesh. The flesh is the corrupted, ruined, and damaged body, in which the evil one dwells. This flesh threatens to dominate the soul.</p>
<p>The human spirit has become a base from which God can spread Himself. In the same principle, the corrupted body, the flesh possessed by Satan, has become the base from which he can do his devilish work. Satan takes his place in the flesh to influence the soul, and then through the soul to deaden the spirit. The direction of all satanic work always begins from the outside and works toward the inside. But the divine work always begins from the center and spreads toward the circumference. We may illustrate this by the following diagram.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EconGod/CWWL_EOG_8.jpg" width="288" height="135" alt="" /></p>
<p>The soul cannot stand against Satan, who is much stronger than the human soul. Our condition before we were saved was that our soul was poisoned by Satan through the flesh. When we heard the gospel and were enlightened in our mind and in our conscience, we became contrite and broken in spirit, repented, and opened ourselves to the Lord. Consequently, He gloriously came into our spirit to be our life in the Holy Spirit. Although Satan, the enemy, has taken the flesh as a base from which to fight inwardly toward the spirit, the glorious Lord uses the spirit as a base from which to fight outwardly toward the flesh.</p>
<p>We are very complicated because we have become a battlefield. We are the universal battlefield for the universal battle. Satan and God, God and Satan, are fighting one another within us day by day. Satan is fighting toward the center, while God is fighting toward the circumference. What is our attitude toward this battle? We cannot be neutral; we must take sides. In the outward part of man is the enemy of God, and in the inward part is God Himself. Between the two, in the middle, is the soul. Satan is in the corrupted body, God is in the regenerated spirit, and we are between, in the human soul. We are very important persons. We can change the whole situation. If we take sides with Satan, God, in a sense, will be defeated. Of course, God can never be defeated, but by our taking sides with Satan, it seems that God is temporarily defeated. But if we take sides with God, the situation will be glorious, and Satan will be utterly defeated.</p>
<p>With whom will you take sides? This is the problem. We need to listen to the Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 16:24: &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself.&rdquo; We must deny the self. In other words, we must put the soul to death on the cross, for the soul is the self. We must always deny the self, always put the self to death, always cross out the self. What will happen when the soul has been crossed out? When the soul has been put to death, only God and Satan are left. By crossing out the soul, we have burned the bridge for the enemy.</p>
<p>Satan is in the flesh, because he is sin incarnated in the flesh, and the self is in the soul. Both sin and the self are illegally married to each other; in fact, they had their wedding day long ago. All the trouble within us is due to the fact that the self is married to sin, and the two have become one. But when we were saved, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit came into our spirit as the divine life. In the flesh, the corrupted body, there is sin; in the soul, the threatened soul, there is the self; and in the regenerated human spirit there is the divine life, the eternal life, which is the regulating life and power. To live and walk by the soulish life means to live and walk by our self, which involves us in marriage with Satan. This marriage means that we are not a free person but are under the bondage of the evil one as sin. The evil one in our flesh will rise up to snatch and defeat us and bring us under his captivity, making us a most wretched person (Rom. 7:24). If, however, we deny the soul, the self, and live and walk by the spirit, Christ as life will regulate and saturate our whole being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS DEALING WITH THE SOUL</h2>
<p>After we have been regenerated, we should not live and walk and do things by our self anymore. As long as we live by our self, we will be under the bondage of Satan. Perhaps you may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I live or do things by my self.&rdquo; However, you need to discern your spirit from your soul. If you do this, you will see how much you are in the soul. You say that you are not living or doing things by your self, but I would ask, By what are you living? By the flesh? Probably you will answer, &ldquo;No, I am not living by the flesh.&rdquo; Then, are you living by the spirit? You may say, &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo; If you are living neither by the flesh nor by the spirit, by what are you living? The answer is that you are living merely by the soul. You may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to commit any sin; I don&rsquo;t like to be fleshly; I don&rsquo;t like to cooperate with Satan. I love God. I like to follow the Lord and walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way. I like, I like, I like...&rdquo; This indicates that you are still in the soul. You need to tell the Lord where you are. You yourself doubt very much that you are in the spirit. If you are not in the flesh or in the spirit, you are in the soul. Praise the Lord that you are not in Egypt, for you have experienced the Passover. You have been delivered out of Egypt, but you have not yet entered into the good land of Canaan. You are still wandering in the wilderness of the soul.</p><h2 class="head2">Human Love</h2>
<p>At this point we need to consider how we can discern the spirit from the soul. How can we know when we are in the spirit or in the soul, and how can we divide the spirit from the soul? To answer this question, we need to look into the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p class="indent1">He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it. (Matt. 10:37-39)</p>
<p>In the Greek text the word translated &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; is the word for <em>soul.</em> The taking up of the cross in these verses is in reference to our human love for our dear ones. Human love is something in our soul, and it must be dealt with by the cross. How much do we love our dear ones? If we want to know how to discern the spirit and the soul, we should check our love. How do we love our children, our mother, or our father? How do we love our brother or our sister? This is not man&rsquo;s word but the word of the Lord. The discerning of the spirit from the soul is attained only when we have checked our human and natural love. Our natural love must be dealt with by the cross. In the New Testament Epistles the Holy Spirit tells us that husbands must love their wives, wives must submit to their husbands, parents must take care of their children, and children must honor and respect their parents. But all this must be in the resurrection life. Natural affection, natural love, and natural relationships must be cut off by the cross. After being dealt with by the cross, we will be in the spirit, which means that we will be in the resurrection life. We will live in the resurrection life&mdash;not in the natural life but in the spiritual life. One test of how much our soul has been broken is how much the cross has dealt with our natural love and affection. When the natural love has been cut off by the cross, we will lose our soul.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to lose our soul by dealing with the natural love, we need to learn how to hate.</p>
<p class="indent1">If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple. Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple. (Luke 14:26-27)</p>
<p>Again, in the Greek text the word translated &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; is the same as that for <em>soul.</em> Besides the love for our dear ones, we also have self-love, that is, the love for self, or for our soul. The taking up of the cross has much to do with this self-love. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must love our enemies (6:27), but we must learn to hate our soul, our self. To hate our self is related to the losing of our soul. By hating our self, we can cross out the self in our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Love of the World</h2>
<p class="indent1">He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it. For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? (9:23-25)</p>
<p class="indent1">Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife. Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive. (17:32-33)</p>
<p>In these verses the word translated &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; is the Greek word for <em>soul.</em> These passages show that the soul is much involved with the love of the world. To give up the love of the world and worldly things means that we must deal with our soul. When the soul is cut off, the love of the world is given up. Therefore, these two things, the love of the world and the soul, are related to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; This word relates to the story of a wife who loved the worldly things (Gen. 19:15-26). The Lord warns us to be careful. If we love the world, we will lose our soul. If we love the things of the world, we will lose our soul in the bad sense, but if we give up the love of the world, we will lose our soul in the good sense. The love of the world is a proof of where our soul is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Natural Life</h2>
<p class="indent1">Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life. (John 12:24-25)</p>
<p>Here again the word rendered &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; is the word for <em>soul.</em> By reading and considering these two verses carefully and deeply, we will see that the soul has much to do with the natural life and the natural strength. Our natural life and strength must be dealt with by our losing the soul. When our natural life and strength are put to death, our soul will be broken. How can we discern the spirit from the soul? Simply by taking the cross to the self-life and by putting the self under death. The soul is deceived because it does not appear to be sinful. Therefore, we must always learn to check the soul by putting the cross on the self.</p>
<p>Suppose we are fellowshipping with a brother. How can we discern whether our fellowship is of the spirit or of the soul? By putting the cross on our self, we will clearly know whether we are in the spirit or in the soul. We should not say, &ldquo;I am not doing something evil. I am doing something good when I fellowship with a brother.&rdquo; Fellowship is good, but our kind of fellowship may be entirely in the soul. When the cross is applied to our self, we will immediately be clear whether our fellowship is in the spirit or in the soul. We should never check the soul or the spirit by the discernment of good and evil. This kind of checking will only put us in darkness. There is no other way to check the soul and spirit but by the cross. The only way to determine whether we are in the soul or in the spirit is by checking whether we are now on the cross. Do we have any element of our own interest, or are we self-centered in our activities? Has the cross been put on our self-interest and self-centeredness? We need to check ourselves in this way. All decisions and all activities must be checked by the cross, not by the standard of good and evil. In every subject of conversation we need to ask ourselves whether the self has been crossed out. We should not analyze by considering, &ldquo;Am I in the spirit or am I in the soul? Let me consider for a moment to see how deep my feeling is. If it is not very deep, I must be in the soul. But if it seems to be deep, I might be in the spirit.&rdquo; If we analyze in this way, we will be troubled. Simply by one check, we can be made very clear: Have we been put on the cross? In other words, have we denied the self, taken up the cross, and followed the Lord in the spirit? When we deny the self by taking up the cross, the Lord Christ will have the full ground in us, and it will be easy for us go along with Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaching gives some place to chastisement, but the cross occupies a much greater place. Many times God&rsquo;s chastisement works together with the cross. But we should not wait for God&rsquo;s chastisement. All the time we must learn to take up the cross, since we know that we have been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). Day by day we must learn the lesson to deny the self, to take up the cross and not give any ground to the soul. If we do this, we will actually be one with the Lord in the spirit, and the Lord will take the ground to possess us and to saturate us with Himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CROSS</h1>
<p>Many Christians know something concerning the cross, but they are not clear concerning the principle of the cross. What is the principle of the cross? According to the Scriptures, God has two creations in the universe. The first is called the old creation, and the second, the new creation. The new creation came into being by putting the old creation to an end and beginning something new. Only by putting the old creation to an end could the Lord bring the new creation into existence. It was through the work of the cross that the old creation was put to an end, and it was through the cross that the new creation began in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ITEMS OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>What are the constituents of the old creation? The first item in the old creation is the angels with the angelic life, and the second is man with the human life. These are two kinds of beings with two kinds of lives. The archangel, the head of the angels, rebelled against God and became Satan (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12-18). The word <em>satan</em> means &ldquo;adversary,&rdquo; indicating that Satan is the adversary of God. Satan not only rebelled, but he led a rebellion against God in which a good number of angels followed him. According to Revelation 12, one-third of the angels, the heavenly stars, followed Satan (v. 4a). These rebellious angels became the spiritual forces of evil&mdash;the rulers, authorities, and world-rulers in Satan&rsquo;s dark kingdom, as mentioned in Ephesians 1:21; 2:2; and 6:12. The rebellion of the angelic life produced the third and fourth items of the old creation&mdash;Satan and his kingdom (Matt. 12:26; Luke 4:5-6).</p>
<p>Now let us briefly continue with the other items of the old creation. After the creation of the human life, the enemy of God also induced man to act against God. This act caused something&mdash;sin&mdash;to be injected into the human life. This sin was the singular, personified sin. The very sinful nature and thought of Satan was injected into the human life (Gen. 3:1-6; Rom. 5:12). Sin in this universe was invented by the injection of the fallen angelic life into the human life. Sin was not created by God but was invented by the illegal union of the satanic life with the human life. Therefore, sin is the fifth item in the old creation. After singular sin came into existence, it brought forth many sins. Therefore, sins as the fruit of sin (6:20-21; 7:5), including lying, murder, pride, fornication, etc., are the sixth item in the old creation. All the sins of man were produced from sin.</p>
<p>The world is the seventh item in the old creation. The world was not created by God. God created the earth, but Satan invented the world. Sin was invented in Genesis 3, but it was not until Genesis 4 that something was added to sin. This added thing was Satan&rsquo;s invented world. What is the world? The world is the system of all human life under Satan (John 12:31; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15). The Greek word for <em>world</em> is <em>kosmos,</em> which means &ldquo;order&rdquo; or &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo; It denotes an ordered system set up by Satan, the adversary of God. God created man for Himself, but now Satan has systematized humanity. Man is no longer for God but is wholly systematized by Satan and for Satan.</p>
<p>Another item besides these in the old creation is death, which is the consequence of sin and sins (Rom. 5:12). The flesh&mdash;the transmuted body, poisoned and ruined by Satan (7:18; 8:3)&mdash;is also an item in the old creation. The body became the flesh through the corruption of Satan as sin. The old man (6:6) is another item, which is nothing less than the entire fallen man ruined by Satan. Man, who was originally created by God, has been ruined by sin.</p>
<p>The next item in the old creation is the self (Luke 9:23-25). The soul of man was created by God (Gen. 2:7), but it has become the self, which is threatened and corrupted by the flesh. God originally created the body as a good and pure thing, but it was corrupted by Satan&rsquo;s sinful nature and became the flesh. The same principle applies to the soul, which was created pure and good but later was influenced by the flesh. It was threatened and then controlled by the flesh and thereby became the self. Sin corrupted the body, causing it to become the flesh, and the flesh influenced and controlled the soul, making it the self.</p>
<p>Finally, the twelfth item in the old creation is the entire creation. The entire creation was damaged and corrupted by the rebellion of the angelic life and by the transgression of the human life. This brought the entire creation under a kind of groaning because of the bondage of corruption (Rom. 8:19-22).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>The aforementioned twelve items added together are the old creation. The old creation includes many things. But we need to be clear at this point that fallen man became the very center of the old creation. He is related to each one of the twelve items of the old creation. First, Satan entered into man and became one with man. Included with Satan is the kingdom of Satan; therefore, since Satan is in man, the kingdom of Satan also is in man. Satan is the ruler of the world; hence, the world too is included in Satan (1 John 5:19b) and also is in man. Furthermore, embodied in man are sin and sins, which issue in death. The flesh, the old man, and the self also are in man, and man was, and still is, the head of all creation. According to Genesis 1:26, man was ordained to be the head of the entire creation. Thus, man is related to the entire creation, and the entire creation is related to man and centralized in man. Man is the very center of the old creation in every aspect. Man nearly becomes all-inclusive, but not in a good sense. If we want to meet Satan, there is no need for us to go to some special place&mdash;by going to man, we will meet Satan. If we desire to contact the kingdom of Satan, there is no need for us to go to the moon&mdash;by going to man, we will contact the kingdom of Satan. It is the same with the world. Within man, as the representative of the old creation, are Satan, the kingdom of Satan, the world, sin, sins, death, the flesh, the old man, etc. Man is not a small creature. On the contrary, man is great and all-inclusive in a negative sense. The entire creation is now centralized in man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENDING OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>One day God Himself became incarnated in this man. This means that God put all creation upon Himself. When God put man upon Himself, He put all the items of the old creation upon Himself. For example, the Scripture says that Christ was made sin&mdash;not plural sins but singular sin&mdash;by God on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). God has also caused all our iniquities to fall on Christ (Isa. 53:6), who &ldquo;bore up our sins in His body on the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24). The incarnated Christ was &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3). This likeness is the likeness of the flesh, and the flesh is the flesh of sin. John 1:14 says that &ldquo;the Word became flesh&rdquo;; that is, He became a man, a human being. When He became a man in the flesh, He became a man in the flesh of sin, since by that time sin was within the human flesh. The flesh had become the flesh of sin, and the Lord became incarnated in this flesh. However, we must be careful, for if we say that He became flesh in the same way that we are flesh, that is, with the sinful nature of the flesh, we are wrong. Hence, Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.</p>
<p>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus Himself told us that He was typified by the bronze serpent that Moses hung on a pole (Num. 21:9), which typifies the cross. The bronze serpent had only the likeness of the serpent, not the poisonous nature of the serpent. The Lord Jesus was born of a virgin so that He might have the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He had nothing to do with the sinful nature of the flesh. We must be very careful about this matter. When the Lord was made sin, He was made only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</p>
<p>The Lord not only put man upon Himself, but He also put Satan, the kingdom of Satan, the world, sin, sins, the flesh, etc., upon Himself. Here again we need to be careful. The Lord was incarnated as a man, not as a serpent, but when He was crucified on the cross, He was crucified as a man in the form of the serpent. Because at this stage man was one with Satan, the serpent, the Lord Jesus and even John the Baptist told the Pharisees that they were the offspring of vipers and a brood of vipers (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33). They were the seed of the serpent (Gen. 3:15), the children of the devil (John 8:44; 1 John 3:10), because they had the serpent&rsquo;s life; the poisonous nature of the serpent was in them. In the eyes of God they, as sinful people, had become serpents. But the Lord, incarnated as a man, had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature that sinful people have. Like the bronze serpent on the pole, the Lord had only the likeness of the serpent, not the nature and the poison of the serpent.</p>
<p>Now we need to see something concerning the cross. Christ first put on man, who included the entire old creation, and then brought this man to the cross. There at the cross this all-inclusive man was crucified. This means that all things were brought to an end on the cross. This is the principle of the cross. Through this kind of death Christ brought man to the cross and thereby brought everything to an end. Not only Christ was crucified there, but also man, the world, Satan and his kingdom, sin, sins, the old man, etc., were crucified on the cross. All things of the old creation were brought to an end by the cross of Christ. We must experience this all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>The following verses reveal the principle of the cross in bringing all things of the old creation to an end:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The angelic life&mdash;Colossians 1:20</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The human life&mdash;Galatians 2:20</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Satan&mdash;Hebrews 2:14 and John 12:31</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The kingdom of Satan&mdash;Colossians 2:15 and John 12:31</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Sin&mdash;2 Corinthians 5:21 and Romans 8:3</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Sins&mdash;1 Peter 2:24 and Isaiah 53:6</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7) The world&mdash;Galatians 6:14 and John 12:31</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8) Death&mdash;Hebrews 2:14</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9) The flesh&mdash;Galatians 5:24</li>
<li>10) The old man&mdash;Romans 6:6</li>
<li>11) The self&mdash;Galatians 2:20</li>
<li>12) All things, or creation&mdash;Colossians 1:20</li>
</ol>
<p>John 12:31 says that the world and the ruler of the world, who is Satan, were to be judged and cast out. When did this happen? According to verse 24, it happened at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. Through Christ&rsquo;s death the world was judged and the ruler of the world was cast out. Hebrews 2:14 declares that Christ partook of blood and flesh that through death He might destroy, or annul, him who has the might of death, that is, the devil. This verse reveals that through His death in flesh and blood Christ destroyed, or annulled, Satan, who has the might of death. Colossians 1:20 says that Christ reconciled &ldquo;all things&rdquo; to Himself. This proves that not only man was wrong with God, but all things also were wrong with God; otherwise, there would have been no need to reconcile all things to God. According to the context of this passage, all creation was dealt with by the cross.</p>
<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the kind of death that Christ died on the cross. That death was an all-inclusive death. This is the reason that we must experience it. All that we have, all that we are, all that we do, and all that is related to us have been brought to the cross. The cross is the end of all things related to us. Everything has been dealt with and already crucified on the cross. The cross is the only ground for all that we are and have. We need to put all things on the cross: our knowledge, our wisdom, our ability, etc. This is the principle of the cross. There is no other ground. We may think about how &ldquo;good&rdquo; we are. The young people especially are always thinking of how good they are. They think, &ldquo;We are young, we are good, we are not like the old folks...&rdquo; No matter how good we are, we must come to the cross. We must be crucified and crossed out. The more good we are, the more we must be crossed out. We should never be proud of being good. Regardless of whether we are good or evil, we all need to pass through the cross. We should not evaluate ourselves wrongly. There is only one evaluation, that is, that we must put ourselves to death.</p>
<p>Nothing of the old creation is in the church. The church is the new man, the new creation (Eph. 2:15; 4:24). All the old things have passed away, and everything has become new (2 Cor. 5:17). This means that all things have been brought to an end in death, and everything is new in resurrection. We have now seen the principle of the cross, and in the next chapter we will see the principle of resurrection. We do trust that our mind will be open to see that all the things related to us, whether they are good or bad, must be utterly put to death. Then there will be the way for us to come into resurrection and into the new creation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF RESURRECTION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we considered the twelve items of the old creation, the first of which was the angelic life. But here we need to point out that those angels who did not fall were not included in the old creation. Though at one time they were under the leadership of Satan, the former head of all the angels, they never followed him in his rebellion; therefore, they are separate from the old creation. Only the rebellious angels, who followed Satan, became a part of the old creation. Thus, the angelic life as the first of the twelve negative items of the old creation does not include the good angels. After they rebelled, the fallen angels became the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers, and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies (Eph. 1:21; 2:2; 6:12; Col. 2:15). The evil spirits mentioned in Ephesians 6 are the fallen angels. The majority of the angels, who did not rebel, were not included in the old creation, which was brought to an end by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion.</p>
<p>However, among the human race there is no such exception, for all humanity fell into the rebellion of the devil (cf. Rom. 3:10-12, 23). The rebellion of the human race began with the first man, Adam, and includes every descendant of his. There are two groups of angels, those who never rebelled and those who rebelled, but as far as the human race is concerned there is only one group. The fallen human race is represented by Adam and is under the headship of Adam; therefore, the whole human race through Adam is included in the fallen old creation.</p>
<p>To be sure Satan, the leader of the rebellious angels, is included in the old creation. Satan misused the authority given him and utilized it to form his kingdom (Matt. 12:26). According to Isaiah 14:12-14, Ezekiel 28:13-14, and Luke 4:5-7, Satan was appointed by God in the very beginning as the head of the angels, and as such he received a certain authority from God. The Lord Jesus in His temptation in the wilderness recognized the authority given to Satan. Under his rule Satan formed a kingdom with a group of angels who also misused their power and authority.</p>
<p>After man was created, Satan came to induce man to sin, and from the sin in man many fruits were produced, called sins. Following the fall, Satan then utilized all the necessities for man&rsquo;s existence, such as eating, clothing, marriage, housing, etc. These necessities had been created and ordained by God for man&rsquo;s existence, but Satan utilized them to systematize the entire human race. This satanic system is called the world.</p>
<p>Because of sin, sins, and the world, death came into the human race. Furthermore, through the fall Satan injected something of his own nature into the human body to corrupt it, causing it to be transmuted into the flesh. Another result of the fall is that man as a whole was changed and became the old man. In addition, man&rsquo;s soul, under the threatening and influence of the flesh, became the self. The soul was originally created good, but through the fall the soul became the self.</p>
<p>Satan was the head of the angels, and Adam was the head of the rest of creation, but both representatives rebelled. Consequently, the whole creation was influenced and affected and needed to be reconciled by Christ&rsquo;s redemption (Rom. 8:20-22; Col. 1:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH IN THE ETERNAL SPIRIT</h2>
<p>All the above-mentioned items compose the old creation, and as we have seen, fallen man became the very center of that creation. All the negative things in the universe were gathered together and concentrated in man. Satan with his kingdom and worldly system was in man, along with sin, sins, death, the self, the flesh, and the old man. Everything of the old creation, including all the negative things in the universe, was centralized in this fallen man.</p>
<p>Eventually, Christ became incarnated as a man. Christ put man upon Himself&mdash;not a small, simple man but an all-inclusive man, a man who included the entire old creation. Christ was incarnated as such a man, and as man He was crucified on the cross in the form of a serpent (John 3:14). Before being crucified on the cross, Christ was a man, but on the cross He was a man in the form of a serpent. Moreover, Christ was made sin on the cross (2 Cor. 5:21). When He was on the cross, God not only put all our sins on Him but also made Him sin. God put all the iniquities and all the sins of the human race on Christ, and at that time He also made Christ sin in the form of Satan, the serpent. Since all the negative things in the universe were concentrated and centralized in fallen man, Christ came into this man and brought this man to the cross. When He brought this man to the cross, He brought every negative thing in the universe to the cross. When He brought this man to an end, He also brought the old creation to an end. All the twelve items of the old creation were terminated by the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross. If we have the heavenly point of view and spiritual insight, we will jump up and say Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The last chapters of Ezekiel show us the building of God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s temple (chs. 40&mdash;48). If the whole picture were drawn on paper, we would discover that the altar, a type of the cross of Christ, is located exactly in the center of the whole construction. Both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the building pinpoint the altar at the center of the temple premises. This is very interesting, for the altar portrays the all-inclusive death of Christ, which has brought the entire old creation to an end through the cross.</p>
<p>Christ accomplished this all-inclusive death through the eternal Spirit. Hebrews 9:14 says that &ldquo;Christ...through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God.&rdquo; The all-inclusive death of Christ occurred through the eternal Spirit. The term <em>the eternal Spirit</em> is mentioned only once in the Scriptures. When Christ was incarnated in man, He became the very center of the entire creation, which included all the negative things in the universe; and when Christ put this fallen man to death on the cross, He did it through the eternal Spirit. He ended this all-inclusive man through a Spirit who is eternal, a Spirit who has no beginning and who can never be ended. In other words, the death of Christ ended everything but the eternal Spirit. Christ brought every negative thing with Him to the cross and ended it, but He remains the same. Though all things were ended on the cross, the eternal Spirit could never be ended. Therefore, it was in and by this Spirit that Christ was resurrected (Rom. 8:11; 1 Pet. 3:18). Christ as a man brought all negative things to death. All things passed into death and were ended; only the eternal Spirit passed through death and remained. It was in this Spirit and by this Spirit that Christ was resurrected.</p>
<p>Romans 1:4 says that Christ was &ldquo;designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; What is holiness? And why does this verse speak of the Spirit of holiness instead of the Holy Spirit? Holiness is simply separation. Even though the eternal Spirit went into death, He was and still is a Spirit of separation. Death could end everything else, but death could not end the eternal Spirit (cf. Acts 2:24); He is different and separate from all things. He is the Spirit of holiness, as proved by the resurrection of Christ from the dead. I may put some books and other items in a trash can to discard them, but if I put a man in a trash can, he will jump out. He will not be willing to be put to an end; he is different from the books. By jumping out, he separates himself from the other items; he becomes a man of separation. In like manner, all things went to the cross&mdash;man, Satan, everything&mdash;and were brought to an end; but only the eternal Spirit, who also went to the cross and into death with Christ, could never be brought to an end. He is the Spirit of separation. Death did everything it possibly could, but death could not hold this Spirit. It is in and by this different Spirit, this Spirit of separation, that Christ was resurrected.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION<br />
IN THE ETERNAL SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; The One who raised Jesus from the dead was the Spirit of separation. This same Spirit of resurrection, who dwells in us, will also give life to our mortal bodies. This means that the reality of resurrection and the principle of resurrection dwell in us. The principle of resurrection is the separation produced by the eternal Spirit, the One who could never be terminated by death.</p>
<p>Seeing that the principle of resurrection is in the eternal Spirit of separation, we must ask where this Spirit is today. We must say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, He is in me!&rdquo; Therefore, the principle of resurrection also is in us. May the Lord open our eyes to see the principle of the cross and the principle of resurrection, that is, that everything was ended by death, and the eternal Spirit now dwells in us. If we see this, we will be transcendent. We will say Hallelujah! There is no need for us to beg, to ask, or to cry. We only need to say Hallelujah all the time.</p>
<p>John 11:25 tells us that Christ Himself is the resurrection. Martha, the sister of the dead Lazarus, complained that the Lord came too late (v. 21). It seemed to her that resurrection and life were a matter of time. If the Lord had come earlier, she reasoned, her brother would not have died. On the contrary, the Lord told her, in effect, that it was not a matter of time or space but a matter of Christ. He said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection.&rdquo; We need to forget about time and space; wherever Christ is and whenever Christ is, there is always resurrection.</p>
<p>On the day of His resurrection, when Christ came to His disciples, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (20:22). This very Spirit whom the disciples received included the principle and reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Without this Spirit the disciples could have nothing to do with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is in this Spirit. If we have this Spirit, we have the reality of resurrection; if we do not have this Spirit, we have nothing to do with resurrection. Resurrection is simply Christ Himself, and the principle and reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the eternal Spirit, who can never be ended. This eternal Spirit, who is without beginning and without ending, is the very principle and the very reality of resurrection. Anything else that is put to death will be ended; only the eternal Spirit cannot be held or terminated by death. So that they might be one with Him in His resurrection, after His resurrection Christ as resurrection came to His disciples and breathed into them, telling them to receive His breath as the eternal Spirit, the Spirit of separation. This very eternal Spirit, as the principle and reality of resurrection, came into the disciples, and this principle and this reality are now in us.</p>
<p>Two more verses will help us to understand this. In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; He seemed to be telling the Philippian believers, &ldquo;I am in prison, but I am not afraid, for within me there is the principle and the reality of resurrection. What is this resurrection within me? It is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with His bountiful, all-inclusive, all-sufficient supply.&rdquo; Then in Philippians 3:10 Paul says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection.&rdquo; What is the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection? It is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The bountiful, all-inclusive, all-sufficient supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. This power and this supply are nothing less than the eternal Spirit, the Spirit of separation, and this Spirit is within us today. Is this Spirit not sufficient for us? What more could we want? We should say Hallelujah! We need to thank the Lord for His cross, and we need to praise Him also for His Spirit. His cross has ended everything negative, and now His eternal Spirit is indwelling us as the power of resurrection.</p>
<p>To summarize, we can never have a genuine experience of the cross unless we are in the eternal Spirit. No matter how much we know concerning the cross and how much we talk about it, if we are not in the eternal Spirit, we can never experience the power of the cross. The more we live and walk in the eternal Spirit of separation, the more we will realize the killing power of the cross (Gal. 5:16, 24). There is no further need for us to reckon ourselves dead; to do this is to commit spiritual suicide. Although many Christians try to commit spiritual suicide daily, they can never succeed. If we simply live and walk in the Spirit, who is the all-inclusive dose within us, we will experience the killing power of the cross. Since the principle and reality of both Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and His death are in the eternal Spirit, we can say that resurrection also includes the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. In the eternal Spirit of resurrection there is the killing factor, the killing power of the cross.</p>
<p>As long as we are in the all-inclusive Spirit, the experience of the cross is ours, and the reality of the resurrection is within us. There is no need for us to do anything but receive this reality by living faith. If we see this, we will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, praise the Lord!&rdquo; We have the living faith, and we receive this reality and claim it by faith. Then the principles of the cross and of the resurrection will be real to us in the indwelling Spirit. We already have Him within us. There is no need for us to ask anymore; we only need to take Him and experience Him and enjoy Him. Then we will experience a real growth in life. I can assure you of this. This is a vision that we need to see and take by faith.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RICHES OF RESURRECTION</h1>
<p class="indent1">This is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them. (Heb. 8:10-11)</p>
<p class="indent1">As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him. (1 John 2:27)</p>
<p>Both Hebrews 8 and 1 John 2 declare that today, under the new testament, there is no need of any outward, human teaching. Hebrews 8:10 says that God&rsquo;s laws are inscribed within us; thus, there is no need for anyone to teach us to know the Lord. First John 2:27 says that the anointing abides in us; hence, we do not need any human teaching. One passage says that God&rsquo;s laws are inscribed in us, and the other says that the anointing abides in us. What are these two things? It is quite possible for us to be Christians for years and yet not know that we have these two wonderful things within us. We have a wonderful law written in us (cf. Jer. 31:33) and a mysterious anointing abiding in us. How marvelous, and yet how pitiful if we do not realize this. It is because of the inner law and the inner anointing that we do not need any outward, human teachings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The inner law and the inner anointing are something of resurrection. We have seen the principle of the cross, that is, the all-inclusive ending of the negative things in the universe, and we have also seen the principle and the reality of resurrection. The cross ends the old creation, whereas resurrection produces the riches of the new creation. Through the cross the old creation is finished. Through the Lord&rsquo;s death all twelve items of the old creation have been brought to the cross and completely crossed out. But that is not the end of the story, for after death came resurrection. What was resurrected? Were Satan, the kingdom of Satan, sin, and the flesh resurrected? A thousand times no! The eternal Spirit resurrected only the essence of what God originally created for His purpose.</p>
<p>The human nature was a part of God&rsquo;s original creation. God created the human nature for His purpose, but Satan damaged it. Therefore, by His death the Lord brought the Satan-damaged nature into death, but by His resurrection the Lord brought the God-created nature into resurrection. The Lord not only redeemed the human nature but also uplifted this human nature to a higher standard. Hence, the new creation consists of Christ in the eternal Spirit and the recovered and uplifted human nature in resurrection.</p>
<p>What are the items of the riches of resurrection? First, there is the Triune God, not in the sense of the Old Testament but in the New Testament sense. Then there is the divine, eternal life, which is God Himself as our life. (The difference between God and the divine life can be illustrated by the difference between electricity and light. Strictly speaking, electricity is light, and light is electricity, but there is still a distinction. For example, electricity is used not only as light but also as power, heat, etc. Similarly, God Himself is our life as well as many other things.) The third item is the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), the fourth is the law of life (Rom. 8:2; Heb. 8:10), and the fifth is the anointing (1 John 2:27). These five items are the all-inclusive riches of resurrection. All the other things that we can name are included in these five items. The new creation inherits all these items in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>All the riches of resurrection, we can say, are simply God Himself. The divine nature is certainly God Himself, and the law of life and the anointing also are something of God Himself and His moving within us. Man, however, is not one of the riches of resurrection but is recovered and uplifted by these riches. We are somewhat familiar with the Triune God, the divine life, and the divine nature, but most Christians are not familiar with the law of life and the inner anointing. In today&rsquo;s Christianity these have been neglected. But the inner law and the inner anointing are the practical riches of resurrection. If we do not know these two things, we cannot know resurrection in a practical way. Resurrection will be known only objectively unless we know the law of life and the inner anointing; only by knowing these two things can we experience resurrection in a subjective way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</h2>
<p>Let us consider the Old Testament with the law and the prophets. In a sense the Old Testament was even called the law and the prophets (Matt. 7:12; 22:40). What is the difference between the two? The law is a set of fixed rules that cannot be changed. For instance, one item of the law requires everyone to honor his parents (Exo. 20:12). This is a changeless rule, and everyone must keep it. There is no need to seek guidance from the Lord concerning honoring one&rsquo;s parents; the law concerning this matter is fixed. Another rule is, &ldquo;You shall not steal&rdquo; (v. 15). This also is an established, fixed rule. There is no need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, tell me whether or not it is Your mind for me to steal. Give me guidance about stealing.&rdquo; There is no need to seek such guidance. This same principle applies to the rest of the Ten Commandments. Thus, the law is a set of fixed rules that everyone must keep. It does not alter with each individual. Regardless of whether a person is a man or a woman and whether he is old or young, rich or poor, he is compelled to keep the rules.</p>
<p>The prophets, however, speak to the individual situation. Suppose someone came to Jeremiah and asked, &ldquo;Is it all right for me to go to Jerusalem?&rdquo; The prophet might say this time, &ldquo;You may go.&rdquo; But another time he might say, &ldquo;You may not go.&rdquo; The prophets give the living guidance of the Lord according to the different individual situations. The law is unchanging, but the word of the prophets may change many times depending on the situation of those involved. Once we have the law, we always have it, for the commandments are permanent; however, the guidance from the prophets is valid only for the occasion. The prophet, therefore, must be contacted continually. The one who sought Jeremiah could not say, &ldquo;One month ago the prophet said it was all right for me to go Jerusalem; therefore, I can go now without consulting him.&rdquo; If this one desired to go to Jerusalem again, he had to seek guidance from the prophet once more. Whether or not he needed to honor his parents required no guidance, for this was a fixed principle of the law, but the way in which he should honor his parents was definitely a matter of guidance. To determine the way he should honor his parents on a certain occasion, guidance was needed; therefore, he had to contact the prophet.</p>
<p>The Old Testament forbids women to wear men&rsquo;s clothing and men to wear women&rsquo;s clothing (Deut. 22:5). This was clearly established by the Lord as a settled rule and a changeless law. But when we are shopping for an article of clothing, one item may be worth two hundred dollars, and another, twenty dollars. Deciding which item to buy is a matter of seeking the Lord&rsquo;s guidance, not His law. This illustrates the difference between the law and the prophets. The fixed principle of the law varies with no one, but the guidance of the prophets varies with everyone. Sometimes with the same person it may vary from one occasion to another.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INNER LAW AND THE INNER ANOINTING</h2>
<p>Is there then any law in the New Testament? There is, but it is not the law of letters. In the New Testament there is only the law of life. This is not an outward law but an inward law; it is not the law written on tablets of stone but the law written on the heart. What about prophets in the New Testament? Just as the law of life replaces the law of letters, so the inner anointing succeeds the prophets. For example, if I have my hair cut, should I seek the Lord&rsquo;s guidance by praying, &ldquo;Lord, show me if I should have my hair cut like a cowboy or like a movie star&rdquo;? There is no need to seek guidance in matters such as this, for there is a law within me forbidding me to have my hair cut in the style of a movie star or a cowboy. The inner law of life regulates me in such matters. Suppose you are a sister in the Lord and you try to have your hair styled like the movie stars. Something deep within will regulate and check you. This is the inner regulating of the law of life. In more than a thousand chapters of the Scriptures there is not one word prohibiting stylish hairdos like those of the movie stars. The movie stars are not mentioned in the Scriptures. But there is an inner law regulating you from patterning yourself after the movie stars.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother is about to minister the word of the Lord. There is no need for him to ask, &ldquo;Lord, should I wear cowboy pants?&rdquo; If he proceeds to dress this way, the inner regulating law will check and prohibit him. This is a fixed principle of the law within him. Neither is there any need for him to seek guidance about cutting his hair like a cowboy. But when and where to get his hair cut are a matter of the Lord&rsquo;s guidance. Therefore, he needs to pray, &ldquo;Lord, is it Your will for me to get my hair cut today? Should I get it cut in the barbershop or in the home of a brother?&rdquo; This is a matter not of the inner law but of the inner anointing. The anointing within is his indwelling Prophet, who gives him guidance. If he becomes careless and does not seek the guidance of the Prophet within, he may go hastily to a brother to get his hair cut and have some trouble. Because of his carelessness about the anointing within, he may suffer. Do you see the point?</p>
<p>Most women like to buy things. When they enter a department store, they have no limitation and no regulation except that of their checking account. But the dear sisters who love the Lord and learn to live and walk by the Lord have a different story. When they enter a department store and pick up an item, something within regulates them and says, &ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; and they obey. When they pick up another item, again the inner regulating says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it; put it down.&rdquo; What is this inner protest? This is the inner law, the law of life. The worldly women can pick up anything they desire, regardless of design, color, and shape. If they like it, they buy it. But the sisters who love the Lord have an inner negative feeling when they pick up certain items. This is the regulating of the inner law.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you need to purchase a certain item, you should seek the guidance of the inner anointing as to how much you should spend for it. You need to fellowship with the Lord, seeking His guidance through the inner anointing. No one else can tell you. If you brought the problem to me, I would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me; ask the indwelling One. You know how much you should spend by the anointing within you.&rdquo; You may ask the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, should I spend one hundred fifty dollars?&rdquo; The inner anointing may say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Eventually, the inner anointing may give you the freedom to spend only fifty dollars.</p>
<p>A husband cannot even tell his wife what she should do. If the wife asks her husband whether she should buy a thirty-dollar hat, he had better say, &ldquo;Dear, you must go to the Lord and seek His guidance by the inner anointing.&rdquo; The inner anointing will tell her, but she needs time to pray and contact the Lord. She may pray, &ldquo;Lord, I worship You. You are my life. You are my Lord, and You are dwelling within me. Lord, give me the proper feeling as to how much I should spend for a hat.&rdquo; After praying in this way, she will sense the Lord within her. The inner anointing will give her a proper inner sense regarding how much she should spend.</p>
<p>If you do not have this kind of experience, I am afraid you may not be a child of God. Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; How does the Spirit of God lead us? He leads us by the inner anointing. Praise the Lord that we are the new creation in resurrection. In resurrection we have the Triune God Himself, we have Him as our life and as our nature, and we also have both the inner law of life and His Spirit as the ointment working within us, continually moving and anointing us with God Himself. The more we are anointed in this practical way, the more we will have the very essence of God within us. The anointing can be likened to a painter who paints a table. The more he paints the table, the more paint is added to the table. The more we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit within us, the more we will gain the substance of God Himself. If we are willing to be continually anointed by the Holy Spirit within us, after a certain period of time we will have more of God&rsquo;s substance with God&rsquo;s essence in our being. God Himself is the paint, the Holy Spirit is the Painter, and the anointing is the painting, the applying of the paint. The Holy Spirit is painting us inwardly with God Himself as the paint. This painting will give us the inner sense of the Lord&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>We need to have the inner regulating and the inner anointing. We are regulated by the inner law to be kept in the Lord&rsquo;s way, and we are anointed by the inner anointing to know the Lord&rsquo;s will in everything. In this way the very essence of God Himself is increased within us all the time. The more we are painted by the Holy Spirit with God as the paint, the more the substance of God Himself will be added within us. These are the riches of resurrection as our inward, practical experience.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE<br />
AND THE SENSE OF LIFE</h1>
<p class="indent1">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write that our joy may be made full. And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. (1 John 1:1-7)</p>
<p>In this short passage there is first the eternal life. From this eternal life there is the divine fellowship, and this divine fellowship brings in the light, which is God Himself. Thus, in this passage we have the life, the fellowship, and the light.</p>
<p>Romans 8:6 tells us, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; This verse speaks of death as well as life and peace. We must realize that either death or life and peace, as mentioned here, is something we can sense deep within us. Otherwise, how can we know that we have death or that we have life and peace? We know that we have death or life and peace by the sense within us. The word <em>sense</em> does not occur in this verse, but it is clear that when we set our mind on the flesh, we know death by sensing it, and when we set our mind on the spirit, we know life and peace also by sensing them. Therefore, there is the inner sense of life in this verse. It appears that this verse has nothing to do with 1 John, but in the reality of the spirit it is very much related to the first chapter of 1 John. In 1 John 1 there is the fellowship of life, and in Romans 8:6 there is the sense of life.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the law of life and the anointing are among the riches of resurrection. We also have God Himself, the divine life, which is Christ in the Spirit, and the divine nature as our riches. These are the five main items of the riches of resurrection, and as those who are in the new creation, we have the position and full right to enjoy these items. On the ground of the new creation we can experience resurrection, which includes God as our portion, Christ as our life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the inner anointing. Consider how rich these things are. Day by day we are enjoying these five items of the riches of resurrection, whether we realize it or not. Even as a newborn child of God, we enjoy these riches and live by these riches every day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p>From the riches of God Himself, the divine life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the inner anointing there are two other items: the fellowship of life and the sense of life. These are the products of the riches of resurrection. The eternal life brings us a divine fellowship. When we have Christ as life in the Spirit, we have fellowship in that life. The fellowship of life is like the current of blood in our body. The blood in our body is the life of our body. If our body contains no blood, there is no life, for the life is in the blood. There is also the current of blood in our body, and through the current of blood all the negative elements are eliminated from our body, and nourishment is transmitted to every part of our body. Day by day the current of blood carries away the waste products and conveys the supply of nourishment to every member of our body. The current of blood continually fulfills these two functions. Negatively, it washes the members of our body and carries away the refuse, and positively, it supplies health to our body.</p>
<p>What, then, is the fellowship of life? Just as the blood is the life of our body, so our spiritual blood is Christ in the Spirit as our life (Col. 3:4). With Christ, our spiritual blood, as our life there is the current of life. Christ as our life is flowing within us all the time, just as the current of blood is continually flowing in our body, and this flowing of life is the fellowship of life. It is by this flowing of life, this fellowship of life, that all the riches of Christ are carried to us. The continual flowing of the riches of Christ meets our need of nourishment on the positive side and of cleansing and discharge on the negative side. Only the medical profession can tell us how much nourishment and discharge is daily carried out by the current of blood. Thus, the fellowship of life is the flowing current of the eternal life, which is Christ.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this matter by considering a light bulb. The current of electricity flowing to the bulb is registered at the meter. If the current is stopped at the meter, no light will appear in the bulb. All the functions of electricity depend on the current of electricity. When the current of electricity is turned off, the function of the bulb to give light ceases.</p>
<p>Before we as unbelievers were saved, we did not have the flowing current of the eternal life. I remember my own experience very well. Before I was saved, I did not have the living feeling of life flowing within me. But from the time I was saved, the more I have loved the Lord, contacted Him, and lived for Him, the more I have sensed something within me flowing and flowing and flowing. This is the current of life, or the fellowship of life. The eternal life, which is the Son of God, is real and substantial. It can even be heard and seen, touched and handled, declared and preached (1 John 1:1-3). Since we have received this life, we have the fellowship, the current, of life. Through this fellowship of life it is very easy for us to be brought into the presence of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>How can we know when we are in the presence of God? God is light (v. 5), and when we are in the presence of God, we can sense the light. We sense not only the inner flowing but also the inner shining, which comes only through the fellowship of life. This is not a doctrine but an explanation of our experience. If we cannot say Amen to these experiences, I am afraid there is something wrong with us. This is exactly what we should have experienced since the day of our salvation, although we may not have been able to explain it. Allow me to repeat: something within us is moving and flowing, and when we are in the flow, we are simply in the presence of God. Then we have the shining within us, and everything is in the light. We are clear about all things&mdash;whether a certain thing is right or wrong, whether it is the will of God or not, and whether it is something of death or of life. All things are made clear by the inner sense.</p>
<p>The sense of life, therefore, is very much related to the fellowship of life. The fellowship of life helps us to realize the sense of life by bringing us into the presence of God, where we can enjoy the shining of God as light. This shining makes us clear about everything. It penetrates into every corner and avenue of our being, bringing to us a very tender and keen sense. A slight mistake is immediately detected by this sense. The more we have the flowing of life, the more we are in the presence of God, and the more shining we will experience. The more we experience this shining, the more we will realize a keen and tender sense. It is by this sense that we can know God, His will, and His way. This sense searches and tests everything.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this inward sense of life always depends on the degree of our inward relationship with the Lord. When we set our mind on the flesh, as the apostle pointed out in Romans 8:6, we are simply setting the self on the flesh. To set the mind on the flesh means that our self is cooperating with the flesh, and if we cooperate with the flesh, our relationship with God, of course, is wrong. I would remind you again of the three concentric circles illustrating the three parts of man (see chapter 6). The flesh is the body (outer circle) changed in nature through Satan&rsquo;s corrupting. The mind is in the soul (middle circle), representing our human being, the self. The Triune God dwells in the spirit (center circle). The mind, located between the flesh and the spirit, has the possibility of moving in either direction. We should never forget Romans 8:6&mdash;it is one of the most important verses in the Scriptures. In a sense it is even more important than John 3:16. If we remember only John 3:16 and forget Romans 8:6, we are a Christian with a poor salvation; we can never be a victorious Christian. John 3:16 is adequate for us to receive eternal life, but Romans 8:6 points out how to be a victorious Christian.</p>
<p>To set our mind&mdash;that is, to set our self&mdash;on the flesh is death. To set our mind, or our self, on the spirit is life and peace. This is the key to death or life. The mind is quite neutral; it is &ldquo;on the fence.&rdquo; It may turn toward the flesh, or it may turn toward the spirit. Again, the story of the garden of Eden must be repeated. Man&rsquo;s free will can make either of two choices. Choosing the tree of knowledge results in death, but choosing the tree of life issues in life. We are between these two; we are neutral with respect to life and death. The issue depends on our choice, our attitude. Personified sin, representing Satan, is in the flesh, the Triune God is in the spirit after we are saved, and the self is in the mind. The secret of life or death depends on our cooperating with the spirit or with the flesh. When we cooperate with the flesh, we have death; when we cooperate with the spirit, we are partakers of God, who is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sensing the Taste of Death</h2>
<p>How do we know that we are in a condition of death? We know by sensing death. Death gives us a certain kind of inward sense. One such sense is that of emptiness. We sense death when we feel empty within. Another sense death gives us is a sense of darkness. When we sense darkness within us, we are in death. Death also gives us the feeling of uneasiness, which includes restlessness and disturbance. There is no soothing within us; rather, there is the sense that everything within is in a state of friction, with no peace, no rest, no comfort, and no calm. Another sense of death is weakness. Often we say, &ldquo;I cannot bear it any longer.&rdquo; This indicates that we are very weak. We have no strength, no power, no weight to stand against our frustrations. Finally, death gives us the sense of depression, oppression, or suppression. Because we are weak, it is easy for us to be depressed. The reason for our weakness and depression is that our mind is set on the flesh, which results in death. Emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, weakness, and depression&mdash;all these are the tastes of the sense of death. We know death within when we sense emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, weakness, and depression. This kind of sense proves that we are in the flesh and are standing with the flesh.</p>
<p>But this sense of death actually comes from the sense of life. Suppose a person is truly dead and is therefore a corpse. Such a person will not have any sense of emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, and so forth, because he does not have life. But if he has life within, though the life may be sickly and weak, he still has a certain sense of emptiness and darkness. He is able to sense all these things because he is still a living person. As a living person he is contacting death, and it is the life within him that gives him the sense of death. One of the functions and purposes of the sense of life is to sense the taste of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sensing the Taste of Life and Peace</h2>
<p>The sense of death, however, is only on the negative side. On the positive side, there is the sense of life and peace. What is the sense, the taste, of life and peace? First of all, in contrast with emptiness, there is satisfaction and fullness. We sense that we are satisfied with the Lord. We are full in His presence and are neither thirsty nor hungry. Second, we sense light, the opposite of darkness. Along with our inward satisfaction we have light shining within us. Every corner and every avenue of our being are full of light. Every part is transparent; nothing is opaque. Then, in contrast to uneasiness, we have peace, which soothes all our disturbances. Peace with rest, peace with comfort, peace with ease, is the sense within us. There is no feeling of friction or controversy. Strength, as opposed to weakness, is another taste of the sense of life. We feel the full strength and power of life. There is a living dynamo within us, and it seems as if there is not merely one motor but four motors. Sometimes we feel the horsepower of a million horses. There is a real strengthening within us that overcomes all our weakness. We do not care about the long face of our wife. If our wife speaks some unpleasant words to us, we will say Hallelujah! Her words will not upset us and cause us to lose our temper, for we are strong. We are not light and weak; we are weighty and full of power. Nothing can turn us upside down. This is the inner sense of life and peace. Finally, in contrast with depression we have liberty. Through the flowing of life, we are not only liberated but also transcendent above all oppression. Nothing can suppress us. The more depression comes, the more we are in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>This is the way that we perceive life and peace. We simply perceive these two things by sensing them, and we sense them because we have life. This life within us is a flowing life. Through the flowing of life we are living and in the presence of God. Therefore, we have the deep, inward sense that we are satisfied, enlightened, strengthened, comforted, uplifted, liberated, and transcendent. The more we are in the fellowship of life, the more we sense life, and the more we sense life, the more we enjoy the increased fellowship of life. These two are always experienced in cycles&mdash;the more fellowship of life, the more sense of life; the more sense of life, the more fellowship of life. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>The fellowship of life and the sense of life are byproducts of resurrection. The main riches of resurrection are God Himself, Christ as life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. From these riches issue two secondary but practical things: the fellowship of life and the sense of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXERCISE OF AND ENTRANCE<br />
INTO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In chapter 17 we saw that the divine life that we have received issues in the fellowship of life, or the current of life, and this current of life produces the inner feeling, the deeper consciousness, of life. Now let us consider the difference between the soul and the spirit.</p>
<p>We need to bear in mind that the tabernacle and the temple had three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The New Testament definitely declares that we are the temple of God (1 Cor. 6:19). Therefore, the tabernacle and the temple are types not only of Christ but also of Christians. The human being consists of three parts: the body, the soul, and the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). These three parts correspond with the three parts of the tabernacle: the body with the outer court, the soul with the Holy Place, and the spirit with the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In the type of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s presence, or the shekinah glory of God, and the Ark, which is a type of Christ, were in the Holy of Holies. Christ in our spirit is the New Testament application and fulfillment of this type. Today Christ is in the innermost part of our being, which is now the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Because of this fact, the book of Hebrews deals with this matter. As we have seen, Hebrews 4:12 sets forth the need to divide the spirit from the soul. In other words, we need to discern the spirit from the soul in order to realize in our experience the living Christ, who dwells in our spirit. This is consistent with the teachings of the entire New Testament. The four Gospels exhort us to deny and renounce the soul, and the Epistles encourage us to walk according to the spirit and live in the human spirit. It is in this spirit that the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit dwells (2 Tim. 4:22). Therefore, we discern the human spirit from the soul by denying the soul and by following the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ALTAR</h2>
<p>Let us consider a problem in the application of this principle. A sister once came to me, saying, &ldquo;If we are not in the spirit as the Holy of Holies, we are still in the body or the soul. How, then, can we exercise the spirit?&rdquo; This question seems quite logical. If we are still in the body or the soul and have not entered into the spirit, how can we exercise the spirit? We cannot answer this question by any mental process. When we are still living in our body or our soul, it does not mean that we are wholly cut off from our spirit. When we exercise our hands or our feet, does that mean that our hands or our feet are cut off from our head? We are a whole being: body, soul, and spirit. We cannot cut this being into three parts. I told this sister that even when she repented and believed on the Lord Jesus, her repentance was an exercise of her spirit. Real repentance requires a contrite spirit (Psa. 51:17; Isa. 57:15; 66:2). If repentance is merely in our mentality, it is not a deep and real repentance. Repentance must be realized deep in our spirit. When we received the Lord Jesus, we exercised our spirit, although we had no conscious knowledge of the term <em>spirit.</em> Every stage in our experience of the Lord is something in our spirit.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we came to the cross, where we were redeemed. In the type of the tabernacle the cross is typified by the altar, which was located in the outer court. We repented and received the Lord Jesus at the cross. At the very moment we were saved, there was a real exercise of our spirit. Because we exercised our spirit, we touched God, sensed God, and had a living contact with God.</p>
<p>But perhaps after being saved, we did not live by the spirit or even by the soul, but by the ways of the world. Yes, we were saved at the cross, which meant that we passed by the altar in the outer court; but we did not subsequently live by the spirit, nor even by the soul; rather, we lived according to the worldly ways.</p>
<p>You may ask what the worldly ways are. Let me illustrate by telling about a brother by the name of Sun, who originally was a judge in a law court. One day he was brought to a gospel meeting where I was preaching. After the meeting this unbeliever came to me with a worldly question: &ldquo;Mr. Lee, please tell me, is God a male or a female?&rdquo; I answered by telling him a little bit about God and Christ. Then he said that he was very impressed by my preaching, but he did not know how to believe. I told him simply to open himself to receive Christ, for Christ is the Spirit and is everywhere. I said, &ldquo;Go home and close your door; kneel down, confess your sins, and open yourself to Christ. Tell Him that you believe He died for you and that you receive Him as your Savior.&rdquo; He promised that he would do it.</p>
<p>That night while he was with his family, who knew nothing about Christianity, he suddenly closed the door to his room. His wife and son asked him what he was going to do, to which he replied that he had some special business and that he had to close the door. He knelt down and prayed. His wife and son, spying through the window, wondered why he was kneeling and laughed at him. After he prayed, he thought something would suddenly happen to him, but nothing happened. The next morning after breakfast he had to go to court to take care of a case, and on his way, all of a sudden, something happened. He told me that the whole universe changed. How wonderful the heavens and the earth became! Even a little dog and a cat, which he formerly despised, were now very pleasant to him. He was so joyful that he began to laugh. He wondered, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; When he entered the courtroom and began his case, he could not control his laughing, and after the case was concluded, he came home laughing more and more. His wife asked, &ldquo;What happened to you? Did you get a lot of money? What makes you so happy and joyful?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I am simply joyful. Everything in the universe has changed.&rdquo; The next day he met a young brother who helped him to realize that he was truly saved.</p>
<p>After this, however, although he was saved, he continued to act and live in a worldly way and look at things as worldly people look at them. In his experience he was still in the outer court under the sun; all his senses were the same as before. On the third day he was brought again to the church meeting. I was happy to see him there. After the meeting he said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, you are a good speaker and are quite eloquent. From what school did you graduate?&rdquo; His remarks revealed the worldly way in which he looked at things. Then he conversed with me about many matters concerning the church. He said, &ldquo;How did you bring in so many people? What means did you use? Did you advertise or use some kind of propaganda like a political party?&rdquo; This is an absolutely worldly way of looking at things. Then he asked me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, I would like to be a Christian. Please tell me the procedure. Do I have to fill out some forms or sign some papers?&rdquo; Of course, I helped him to have the right understanding. But then he asked me, &ldquo;Suppose I become a member of your church; how much money do I have to contribute yearly? And what shall I do with my family? Will your church control my whole family? Will you give many regulations to my wife and child?&rdquo; This is the worldly way. This person was truly saved, but all these things proved that he was still in the outer court and even still in Egypt. He had experienced the Passover, but he had not yet crossed the Red Sea. He was still in the physical world.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST VEIL</h2>
<p>Let us continue to use this brother as an illustration. He was saved in 1938. The next year nothing further happened. He was truly saved, but he was still entirely in the world. For three years nothing happened. Then in 1941 he was revived; something revolutionized him. One day while praying, he dropped everything worldly. He said, &ldquo;Lord, I give up my knowledge, my job as a judge, my family, and everything of the world. Lord, from now on I love You. I was saved three years ago, but now I know that I need to drop everything worldly.&rdquo; He gave up the world.</p>
<p>In so doing this brother passed through the first veil from the outer court and entered into the Holy Place. From that very day he discovered how to fellowship with Christ and how to take Christ as his daily manna through the reading of the Bible. The Bible became very precious and sweet to him. Every day he enjoyed taking something from the Bible as food. From that day he not only enjoyed the bread on the table but also was enlightened by the light within. In addition, he had the joy of praying. He told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee (he never called me Mr. Lee anymore), whenever I close my eyes and pray, I have the feeling that I am in the heavens.&rdquo; What is this? It is the sweet savor of the burned incense. He felt the presence of God because he had the experience of Christ as his daily manna, as the inner light, and as the sweet savor of resurrection.</p>
<p>At this point we need to be very clear concerning where this experience took place. This brother entered from the outer court into the Holy Place by passing through the first veil. He had not yet passed through the second veil. First, his sins were dealt with at the altar, typifying the cross, but the world and the worldly things were still upon him. Three years later, by passing through the first veil, he dropped the world and the worldly things and entered into the Holy Place. Day by day he began to experience Christ as his life, his food, his light, and his sweet savor of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SECOND VEIL</h2>
<p>Still, he was not in the Holy of Holies. The sins and the worldly things were gone, but one thing remained&mdash;the flesh. Hence, there was still another veil of separation. Through recent correspondence from the Far East, I learned that during the last year or two this brother has been experiencing the breaking of the outer man. The breaking of the outer man is the rending of the second veil. It is the rending, or breaking, of the flesh. The letters reveal that from his experience of the breaking of the outer man, this brother is receiving the real discernment of the spirit. He can discern not only his own spirit but also the spirit of others, because now he is more in the spirit.</p>
<p>When we entered the outer court through salvation, our sins were dealt with. When we entered the Holy Place, the world was put to death. The self, however, is still left if we have not entered the Holy of Holies. Day by day we can enjoy Christ as the wonderful manna, as the heavenly light, and as the sweet savor of resurrection, but this experience is still rather shallow, for everything in the Holy Place is openly displayed. The bread is not the hidden manna, the light is not the hidden law, and the incense is not the hidden rod of resurrection. When we come into the meeting, everyone can see that we are showing the manna, shining the light, and spreading the sweet odor of the burned incense. If this is the case, we should not think that we are deep. Many times when we come to the meeting with the sweet odor of burned incense, some may comment, &ldquo;What a nice brother!&rdquo; or &ldquo;She is such a sweet sister! Whenever she opens her mouth, everyone senses the sweet savor of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is not the hidden manna, the hidden law, or the hidden budding rod. However, these good experiences in the Holy Place should not be rejected. On the contrary, we should respect them. Praise the Lord that many are enjoying Christ as their daily manna. Day by day they are also enjoying Christ as their light and as their sweet savor in resurrection. But we must realize that this is not the goal; this is not the land of Canaan. This is only the wilderness, where there is the living rock flowing with the living water and where Christ is supplying us with the daily manna. To partake of the manna from heaven and the living water flowing out of the rock does not prove that we are in the goal of God. It proves only that we are not in Egypt, that is, not in the world. In other words, we are in the Holy Place but are not in the Holy of Holies. It is a holy place, but it is not the holiest place. We must press on to enjoy the best. It is not sufficient to be merely out of Egypt&mdash;this is only the negative aspect. There is something much more positive. We need to enter into the good land, which is the type of the all-inclusive Christ in our spirit. Neither the passover lamb in Egypt nor the daily manna in the wilderness can compare with the good land of Canaan. The good land of Canaan includes not merely one aspect or one part of Christ; it typifies the all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<p>Again we must point out that when we were saved, unconsciously we exercised our spirit. There is no doubt about this. Now in the Holy Place, day by day we read the Scriptures, contact Christ, and experience the shining of the light. All these things also must be experienced by exercising our spirit, even though we may be a person who lives in the soul rather than in the spirit. We may read the Scriptures in the morning by exercising our spirit and thereby feed on Christ as our daily manna, but as far as we ourselves are concerned, we are not yet in the spirit; we are still in the soul. Finally, one day we will realize that the self must be dealt with and broken. When we realize that we have already been crucified, we will apply the cross to our self; and when we realize by experience that the self has been buried, we as a person will be transferred into the spirit. Then we will not only exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, but our whole being will be in the spirit. Thus, there are three strategic points that we need to pass: the altar, the first veil, and the second veil. At the altar our sins are dealt with, at the first veil the world is dealt with, and at the second veil we ourselves&mdash;the soulish life, the natural man, the outer man, the flesh, the self&mdash;are dealt with. Then we become a person in the spirit. This is beyond the mere exercise of our spirit to experience something of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE RED SEA<br />
AND THE JORDAN RIVER</h2>
<p>Let us look further into the geography and history of the children of Israel. In Egypt the people of Israel partook of the passover, which dealt with their sins. They were saved when their sins were dealt with by the passover lamb, but the Egyptian forces, Pharaoh and his army, still enslaved them. Consequently, Israel had to pass through the Red Sea. Under the waters of the Red Sea the worldly forces were buried. As a type, the army of Pharaoh represented a host of people and all the worldly things. With some people, a pair of eyeglasses is a &ldquo;soldier of the Egyptian army,&rdquo; because for them it is a worldly item. With others, the matter of dress is not only a single soldier but a whole division of soldiers in the Egyptian army. Many worldly items bind and control us under their tyranny. But when Israel passed through the Red Sea, the whole world was dealt with. The entire Egyptian army was buried under the water of the Red Sea. The water of the Red Sea typifies the first aspect of the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. All the worldly things are dealt with and buried in the death of Christ (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>Later, after Israel left Egypt, they began wandering in the wilderness and daily enjoyed manna, which was something heavenly as a type of Christ. They could always testify to others how they enjoyed manna, but at the same time they were wandering in the wilderness. One day they passed through the Jordan River, and in the water of the Jordan twelve stones representing the old Israel were buried (Josh. 4:9). Under the water of the Red Sea the Egyptian forces were buried, but under the water of the Jordan twelve stones, representing the self and the old man of the Israelites, were buried. After this, the Israelites entered the third place, the land of Canaan, and enjoyed its all-inclusive riches.</p>
<p>When the people of Israel were in Egypt, they were in the outer court. When they came into the wilderness, they were in the Holy Place. Finally, when they entered into Canaan, they were in the Holy of Holies. The Red Sea corresponds to the first veil, and the Jordan River to the second veil. It is very clear that these two waters typify the two aspects of the cross of Christ. The first aspect of the cross deals with all the worldly things, and the second aspect deals with our soul. In other words, it is the cross that rends the two veils. We must pass through the two veils, just as the Israelites had to pass through the two waters.</p>
<p>Now we must check ourselves and determine where we are. Are we in Egypt, in the wilderness, or in Canaan? In other words, are we in the outer court, in the Holy Place, or in the Holy of Holies? Are we in the worldly atmosphere, where everything is under the sun? Those who are in the outer court do not have the light of the Holy Place&mdash;they have only the sun. All worldly things are under the sun. Are we Christians who believe in the Lord Jesus, accept Him as our Savior, and believe that He died on the cross for our sins, yet still have the worldly point of view and live in the worldly atmosphere? Or are we in the Holy Place enjoying Christ day by day as our manna, our heavenly light, and our sweet savor of resurrection?</p>
<p>Or are we deeper than this? In the Holy of Holies we can experience Christ as the hidden One&mdash;not as Aaron in the outer court but as Melchizedek in the heavenly Holy of Holies. Here we can enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, as the hidden law, and as the hidden authority of resurrection in order to rule over all things. Everything here is hidden, because Christ is now experienced in the deepest way within us. May the Lord be gracious to us that we may know where we are and where we need to go.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HIDDEN CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<p>The tabernacle and the temple, as we have seen, were composed of three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Inside the outer court the tabernacle and the temple were divided into two parts: the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Before we see the items in the Holy of Holies, we must first look at the items in the outer court and the Holy Place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTER COURT</h2>
<p>In the outer court there were two things: the altar and the laver. All Bible students agree that the altar is a type of the cross of Christ (Heb. 13:10) and the laver is a type of the work of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11). Have we experienced the altar and the laver? On the cross Christ was offered as our sin offering. He died for our sins, and He was even made sin on the cross for our sake (15:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). Hence, He is our Passover. The meaning of the Passover is that Christ, the very Lamb of God (John 1:29), bore our sins and died on the cross. First Corinthians 5:7 clearly states that Christ is our Passover. The day that we believed in Christ&rsquo;s death for our sins was the day of our Passover. It was on that day that we enjoyed Christ as our Passover lamb.</p>
<p>After we experienced the altar of the cross, immediately the Holy Spirit began to work, as signified by the laver. The laver was a place for the priests to wash and be cleansed. After we receive Christ as our Passover, the Holy Spirit begins His cleansing work within and without. When the priests entered the tabernacle, they had to pass the altar with the sin offering and the trespass offering, and they also had to wash their feet and their hands in the laver to cleanse away all the earthly dirt. From the time we are saved, the Holy Spirit cleanses us from all the earthly dirt of our daily walk. If we have had the experiences at the altar and the laver, it means that we have been saved and are no longer outside the outer court. Once we are inside the outer court, we are within the boundary and realm of God. In other words, we are in the kingdom of God, for we have been regenerated, redeemed, and forgiven and are now cleansed by the working of the Holy Spirit. Unless we have experienced both the altar and the laver, we can never be a genuine child of God. Even though we may have outwardly entered Christianity, without the experience of these two things, we are still outside the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY PLACE</h2>
<p>However, this is not all; this is merely the ABCs of the Christian life. We must press on further. We have entered the main gate of the tabernacle, but there is still another veil, or gate, which we must enter. From the outer court, from the place to which we came by believing in the Lord, we need to enter into the Holy Place.</p>
<p>The first item in the Holy Place was the table of the bread of the Presence, a table on which the bread was displayed. The bread is a type of Christ as our food, for He is the bread of life (John 6:35). Christ is the supply for our daily life. He is our daily manna, nourishing us that we may live before God. The table of the bread of the Presence did not contain only one piece of bread; it held a large amount of bread (Lev. 24:5-6). This means that we can experience an abundant supply of life, just like the manna that fell from heaven. Every morning there was an abundant supply of manna. After experiencing Christ as our Passover and the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit, have we gone on to experience Christ as our daily manna? If we have, we know the table of the bread of the Presence in a living way.</p>
<p>The lampstand follows the table of the bread of the Presence as the second item in the Holy Place. This signifies that Christ is the light as well as the life. John 1:4 says that life is in Christ, and this life is the very light of men. John 8:12 also states that this light is the light of life. If we enjoy and experience Christ as life, He will definitely become our light. When we feed on Christ, we sense the shining within enlightening us. After we have received Christ as our Passover and have been cleansed by the working of the Holy Spirit, and after we know how to feed on Christ as our daily bread of life, we can sense the inner shining.</p>
<p>The third item in the Holy Place, the altar of incense, follows the table and the lampstand. We experience the incense altar when we sense a savor, a sweet-smelling odor, which is Christ in resurrection, spreading and ascending toward God. When we enjoy Christ as our food and are in His light of life, we are in resurrection. Within us there is something sweet spreading and ascending toward God. This can never be confirmed by knowledge or by doctrine, but must be checked by our experience. Do we have such experiences? Although we may not have enough of these experiences, the main issue at this time is that we have such experiences. I can testify that these experiences are wonderful. Thirty-three years ago I was daily and even hourly in the Holy Place. Christ was my daily bread, and I was full of Him and full of light. I was very pleased with God, and He was very pleased with me, and something of Christ within me was spreading and ascending to God as a sweet savor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ARK IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>But is this the end? This is something holy, but it is not the holiest. It is good, but it is not the best. Therefore, we need to press on again in order to enter the Holy of Holies. The first veil, the screen (Exo. 26:36), must be passed through, but the second veil (vv. 31-33) must be rent (Matt. 27:51). This veil is the flesh (Heb. 10:20), which must be broken before we can enter the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>There is only one thing in the Holy of Holies&mdash;the Ark. All students of the Bible agree that the Ark is a type of Christ. Although Christ can be enjoyed as our food, as our light, and as our sweet savor toward God, Christ <em>Himself</em> is in the Holy of Holies. Christ as food, as light, and as the sweet savor are the three items in the Holy Place, but now Christ Himself must be touched. We must not touch Christ merely as some item; we must touch Christ Himself. This is deeper. We must make contact with Christ Himself. We have experienced Christ as our Passover and the washing of the Holy Spirit, and we have experienced Christ as life, as light, and as the sweet savor; now we need to contact Christ Himself. Very few Christians have entered into the Holy of Holies in order to touch Christ Himself as the Ark.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the contents of the Ark. It is quite meaningful to see that manna was in the Ark (Exo. 16:33-34; Heb. 9:4). The manna in the Ark was not the open manna but the hidden manna (Rev. 2:17); it was not the manna displayed but the manna hidden in a secret place. The hidden manna, no doubt, corresponds with the bread of the Presence. The difference, however, is that the bread was shown forth, but the manna in the Ark was hidden. The bread of the Presence was exhibited on the table, but the manna in the Ark was hidden in the golden pot (Exo. 16:33; Heb. 9:4). Not only was the manna hidden in the golden pot, but this pot was hidden in the Ark. Thus, the manna was doubly hidden. In the wilderness the people of Israel enjoyed the manna, but the manna they enjoyed was public manna; it was manna that had fallen to the earth, not the manna hidden in the heavens. The hidden manna is Christ Himself, a Christ who is deeper than the Christ signified by the public manna.</p>
<p>We need to experience such a deeper Christ, a Christ in the secret place, a Christ in the heavenlies. This is the Christ mentioned in Hebrews 7 as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not according to the order of Aaron (cf. Heb. 5:6, 10; 6:20). Aaron ministered in the outer court, offering sacrifices on the altar; Melchizedek ministers on the throne of grace in the heavenlies (4:16; Rev. 4:2). We may experience Christ as our food, but this enjoyment is only in the Holy Place, and whatever we experience is immediately known by many people. Sometimes the news of our &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; experience spreads across the whole nation. This is nothing but the experience of the open bread of the Presence. We need to press deeper to enter into &ldquo;the secret place of the Most High&rdquo; (Psa. 91:1) in order to touch the heavenly Christ Himself.</p>
<p>In the Ark there was also the law, the regulating and enlightening law (Exo. 25:16, 21; Deut. 10:1-5). The law corresponds with the lampstand in the Holy Place. The law is the testimony of God, and the lampstand in both the Old Testament and the New Testament also is the testimony of God. Though the law corresponds with the lampstand, the principle is still the same: the lampstand shines forth openly, but the law in the Ark is a hidden, inner, and deeper light. Many times the brothers and sisters have only the light of the lampstand. This light may shine brightly within them. In one sense, that is good, but in another sense, these brothers and sisters are still shallow, because everything is showing forth on the surface. They need Christ to become their inner law. Those who have Christ as their living law hidden within them do not show forth much outwardly, but inwardly they know Christ in a deeper way.</p>
<p>Third, the budding rod was in the Ark (Num. 17:10-11). This rod, with sprouted buds, typifies the resurrected Christ. This corresponds with the savor of the incense, both of which signify the resurrected Christ; but again the difference is that the incense is openly expressed, whereas the budding rod is experienced in a hidden and deeper way.</p>
<p>We have seen three things in the Holy Place: Christ as food, Christ as the light of life, and Christ as the sweet savor. But the three things in the Ark in the Holy of Holies are deeper. The bread of the Presence is something that shows forth, the lampstand is something that shines forth, and the incense is something that spreads forth&mdash;all are outwardly exhibited. But the three things in the Ark are deeply and inwardly hidden.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESSING DEEPER INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>We are now clear that the Holy Place represents the wilderness on one hand and the soul on the other hand. In ancient times the Israelites were originally in Egypt. Since it was in Egypt that they experienced the passover, Egypt was their outer court. After the passover, they were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness. In other words, they proceeded from the outer court into the Holy Place.</p>
<p>While the Holy Place corresponds to the wilderness in relation to the Israelites, it corresponds to the human soul in relation to the Corinthian and Hebrew believers. For example, the believers in Corinth had experienced Christ as their Passover (1 Cor. 5:7) and then passed into the wilderness in their experience, where they enjoyed Christ as their manna and as their living water (10:1-5). They too were in the wilderness, like the Israelites of old, but the wilderness for the Corinthians was the soul. By reading 1 Corinthians carefully, we see that the Corinthians were soulish and fleshly (2:14; 3:1-3). Yes, they enjoyed Christ as their food and as their light and had many wonderful experiences of Christ, but their enjoyment of Christ was in their soul. Their flesh, the veil that separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place, had not been broken. Their soul had not been dealt with; hence, they were not in the spirit, which is the Holy of Holies. They enjoyed something of Christ, but they did not enjoy Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Christians also were typified by the Israelites in the wilderness (Heb. 3:5&mdash;4:16). The apostle Paul pointed out to the Hebrew Christians as well as to the Corinthians that the people of Israel were the illustration of their own condition. Chapter 4 of Hebrews indicates that to enter into the rest is to enter into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace, where Christ our High Priest is today (vv. 11, 16). The Hebrew Christians enjoyed something of Christ through the elementary teachings of the faith (5:12; 6:1). First Corinthians deals with the matter of gifts (12:1), whereas Hebrews deals with the matter of doctrines. The Corinthian believers were in the soul enjoying the gifts, and the Hebrew Christians also were in the soul enjoying doctrines; therefore, they could not understand the deeper things. Since both the Corinthians and the Hebrews were addicted either to their gifts or to the elementary doctrines, they had to tolerate the wilderness in their souls.</p>
<p>This is the reason the apostle Paul entreated the Corinthian believers to know the spirit and be spiritual men instead of soulish men (1 Cor. 2:11-15). In Hebrews 4:12 he said the same thing to the Hebrew believers&mdash;that they needed to divide, or discern, the spirit from the soul. The principle in these two books is the same. Only these two books in the New Testament refer to the history of Israel in the wilderness. The reason for this is that the Corinthians were soulish in their gifts, and the Hebrews were soulish in their doctrines. Many Christians today are soulish in their gifts, and many others are soulish in their doctrines. Without a doubt, the doctrines helped the Hebrew Christians and the gifts helped the Corinthians. But these Christians were all in the soul, which is the Holy Place, not in the spirit, the Holy of Holies, where they could touch and experience Christ Himself. In order to contact Christ in our spirit, we must forsake our soul. We should not remain in the soul. If we remain in the soul, we are wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>You may say, &ldquo;Why is this important? I still enjoy something of Christ. Why do you say that the doctrines are only elementary? Through these doctrines I know something about Christ and enjoy something of Him. You say that the gifts are stressed too much. Why, then, do I still enjoy something of Christ through the gifts?&rdquo; Look at the picture in the wilderness. For more than thirty-eight years the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, and day by day through all that time they partook of manna. God is merciful. He is not a small God but an exceedingly generous God. Even when the Israelites were wrong, God still granted them something. But the manna, which fell from the heavens daily, did not justify the wandering of the people of Israel in the wilderness. On the contrary, it proved how babyish and fleshly they were in enjoying nothing more than manna for thirty-eight years. Manna was all right for a short time; but they should have soon left it to enjoy the produce of Canaan.</p>
<p>The lesson for us is simply this: to have the gifts for a short time is permissible, but to insist on having the gifts all the time only proves that we are babyish. We must go on and even press on. The gifts are not our portion&mdash;Christ is the portion that God has allotted us (Col. 1:12). Before the apostle Paul dealt with the gifts in 1 Corinthians, he pointed out that Christ Himself is our portion. We are not called into the fellowship of gifts; rather, we are called into the fellowship of Christ (1:9). God did not make the gifts our wisdom, but He made Christ our wisdom. It is through Christ that we are justified, sanctified, and redeemed (v. 30). We need to thank God for His gifts, but they are a help for only a short time. Israel surely could thank God for their daily manna, but the manna was only a temporary provision until they arrived in the good land. They should not have remained in the wilderness with the manna every day for thirty-eight years. Praise God for His wisdom and mercy, and thank God for His gifts, for when we are wandering in the wilderness, we do need the daily manna and the gifts to help us. But this does not justify our continuing in such a course over an extended period of time. On the contrary, it may prove that we are still young and even babyish. If we would press on, there would be no further need for us to enjoy manna; we could begin immediately to enjoy the produce of the good land of Canaan. Our enjoying the produce of the good land proves that we are in the rest and in the spirit. Otherwise, we are like Israel, remaining in the wilderness of our soul. If we are not in the spirit, the cross must deal with our flesh and our soul.</p>
<p>Hebrews 4, 5, and 6 exhort us to press on, and 1 Corinthians 9 exhorts us to run the race. We must press on to enter our spirit in order to touch Christ Himself and experience the deeper Christ as the hidden manna, the inner law, and the secret budding rod. The writer of 1 Corinthians advised the Corinthian believers to adjust and limit themselves in relation to the gifts. They needed to learn how to use the gifts in a proper way (ch. 14). If we read 1 Corinthians carefully and objectively, we will see that the intention of the writer was not to encourage but to adjust the believers in the practice of gifts. In order to run the race in a proper way, we must know the deeper things of Christ in the spirit (2:6-16).</p>
<p>Now we all need to check where we are. Are we at the altar or the laver? Perhaps we are even outside the main gate. Have we experienced these two items in the outer court and gone on to the table of the bread of the Presence, the light of the lampstand, and the sweet savor of the incense? Have we passed through the Holy Place to be presently in the Holy of Holies? If so, we are in the spirit, touching and experiencing Christ Himself in the deepest way. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may know where we are.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRIPARTITE MAN AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>We must remember that God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into us. This is also the mark of His economy. We were made with three parts: the body outwardly, the spirit inwardly, and the soul in between. God&rsquo;s intention is to dispense Himself into the spirit of man and then work Himself into man&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRIPARTITE MAN COMPLICATED BY THREE PERSONS</h2>
<p>Before God could fulfill His intention, Satan, the enemy of God, wrought himself into the body of man. Thus, in the members of the body there is sin, and this sin is personified. As an illegal king, it can rule over us and force us to do things against our will (Rom. 7:15-17). Satan himself, as the evil nature and as the law of sin, dwells in us to corrupt our body. The flesh is the body poisoned by Satan, and in us, that is in our flesh, nothing good dwells (v. 18). Our flesh serves the law of sin against our mind and against our will (vv. 15, 20, 25).</p>
<p>Satan came into our body as the law of sin, but praise the Lord, when we were saved, the Triune God came to dwell in our spirit as our life. Christ as our life is in our spirit (Col. 3:4; 2 Tim. 4:22). What then is in our soul? Our self is in our soul. We need to be impressed that all three beings&mdash;Adam, Satan, and God&mdash;are in us today. Thus, we are quite complicated. The man Adam is in us, the devil Satan is in us, and the Lord of life, God Himself, is in us. Hence, we have become a little garden of Eden. Adam, representing the human race, the tree of life, representing God, and the tree of knowledge, representing Satan, were the three parties in the garden of Eden, and now these three parties are all in us. Adam, the self, is in our soul; Satan, the devil, is in our body; and God, the Triune God, is in our spirit. But we are more than a little garden; we are a great battlefield. Satan is in us fighting against God, and God is in us fighting against Satan. Satan takes our body, which is the flesh, as the base for his fighting, and God takes our spirit as the base for His warfare.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:17 says, &ldquo;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.&rdquo; According to the context of Galatians 5, the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. This means that our flesh lusts against the indwelling Spirit, and the Spirit lusts against our flesh. These two oppose one another so that we would not do the things that we desire. The corrupted flesh fights against the Spirit in our spirit, and the Spirit fights against the flesh. These two parties are always warring with each other. Satan is in our flesh as sin, and the Triune God is in our spirit as life. Day by day there is a spiritual warfare raging between these two parties in the battlefield of our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRIPARTITE MAN REPRESENTED BY THE MIND</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there are three parts in the soul&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will. The mind as the thinking organ of the soul represents the self. What we think and consider always precedes what we do; therefore, our mind represents our self. For this reason Romans 7, 8, and 12 deal with the mind. Romans 7 tells us that the mind stands with the law of God. My mind desires to keep the law of God and by itself desires to serve God (v. 25); however, my mind, representing my self, is too weak. I myself am too weak. Whenever I make up my mind to do good, there is something else stronger than my self, stronger than my mind. This stronger one is the sinful one in my flesh. Whenever I exercise my mind to do the will of God and keep the law of God, the evil one in my members rises up against me, defeats me and brings me into captivity (v. 23). My mind, representing my self, cannot keep the law of God; if my mind tries to do the will of God by itself, it is always defeated.</p>
<p>The mind in Romans 7 is an independent mind that tries to do good by itself. The apostle brings us into chapter 8 and tells us how the mind must be dependent. The independent mind, trying to do things under its own power, will be defeated. On what then must the mind be dependent? Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; There are two possibilities for the mind: it may depend either on the flesh or on the spirit. If it depends on the flesh, the result will be death, but if it depends on the spirit, there will be life and peace. Have we seen the difference between the independent mind in chapter 7 and the dependent mind in chapter 8? An independent mind will be defeated, but a mind dependent on the spirit will have victory. Since there are two parties within us&mdash;Satan in our members and the Triune God in our spirit&mdash;we can no longer be truly independent; thus, we should never try. If we do, we will surely be defeated. If we attempt to defeat the enemy, we will eventually be defeated by him. We must therefore turn in dependence to another One, to the Triune God within our spirit. The key to victory is to always set our mind on the spirit.</p>
<p>We must all be impressed with this clear picture: Satan is in us, Christ is in us, and the self stands in the middle. The enemy tempts us to do good by our own effort, and the usual response is, &ldquo;I love the Lord and belong to the Lord; therefore, I want to do good to please Him.&rdquo; This is the temptation. When we are independent and making up our mind to do good by our own strength, we are being tempted, and we will surely be defeated. We may be able to do good today, tomorrow, and possibly even for three days, but we certainly will not be able to keep it up for three and a half days. The lesson we need to learn is never to be independent and try to do things in our own strength, but always to depend on the Lord. Whenever we are tempted to do good by our own effort, we need to tell the enemy, &ldquo;No, Satan! I cannot and will not go that way. I don&rsquo;t know anything about doing good; I know only one thing&mdash;to depend on my Lord. I will not be drawn away from leaning on Him.&rdquo; If we respond in this way, we will have the victory with life and peace. It is very simple. The Triune God has dispensed Himself into our spirit as our life and as everything to us; therefore, we must learn never to do anything independently or anything in our own strength.</p>
<p>Before we leave these two chapters of Romans, we must see something about laws. We have seen that sin is in the flesh, and with sin there is a law, the evil law of sin. We all know what a law is. If I pick up a book and throw it into the air, it will inevitably fall to the earth. This happens because of the law of gravity. But let me do something against this law, such as lifting a book with my hand and holding it in the air for two or three hours. I can sustain this for a while, but finally I will have to give up. Why? Because my own effort cannot stand against the law of gravity. Our personal effort cannot contradict the natural law. In the morning we may say to ourselves, &ldquo;I need to be patient. I must not lose my temper. I must endure for a whole day.&rdquo; Perhaps we can be patient for even two days, but on the third day we will lose our temper in a big way. Losing our temper is the result of the law of sin; not losing our the temper is the issue of our own effort. Being proud also is the result of a law operating within us. None of us has ever graduated from a &ldquo;school of pride.&rdquo; Nevertheless, even a little child knows how to be proud. Parents never teach their children to be proud. How then can they be proud? Pride comes from our nature, and this sinful nature is a law, the law of sin within us.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the illustration of holding a book in the air. If I see a table in front of me, it would be foolish for me to exert my effort to hold the book in the air. The table represents another law&mdash;the law of a solid support versus the law of gravity. I can lay the book on the table and shout Hallelujah. I can leave it there and be at peace. The book is perfectly safe on the table, because the law of a solid support overcomes the law of gravity. Who is the real support? It is Christ as the rock (2 Sam. 22:3; Matt. 16:18). And where is this Christ? He is in our spirit. Therefore, we can set our mind on the spirit and &ldquo;leave the book on the table.&rdquo; We can forget about our own effort. We should never make up our mind to do good. We should never say, &ldquo;Before, I was cruel to my husband (or wife, or someone else); now, today, I determine to be kind.&rdquo; We may be kind for a day or two, but we cannot last much longer than that. We should never try to make any resolutions. It does not work. Within us is Christ, the everlasting rock. He is in us as our &ldquo;table,&rdquo; as our rock. We should simply set our mind on Him all the time, leave ourselves on the rock, and go to sleep. This is the way of victory and release. When we set our mind on the spirit, we simply hand ourselves over to Christ. When we rely on Him, we simply say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, here I am, hopeless and helpless. From now on I will never try to make up my mind to do anything. I give my mind to You. I set my mind on You.&rdquo; By doing this, we hand ourselves over to the Lord. The Lord then has the ground and the opportunity to spread Himself through us and saturate us with Himself. How wonderful!</p><h2 class="head1">TRIPARTITE MAN REALIZING THE BODY LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we go on from Romans 8 to Romans 12. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 are parenthetical chapters; thus, chapter 12 is the continuation of chapter 8. In chapter 7 the mind was independent, but in chapter 8 the mind is dependent&mdash;dependent on the spirit. The mind in chapter 7 represents the independent self struggling by its own effort, which always ends in defeat. The mind in chapter 8 represents the dependent self resting on the Lord Jesus. This gives the Lord the opportunity to saturate our whole being with Himself, causing us to become a living member of His Body. We are then brought to chapter 12. Chapter 12 deals with three things for the realization of the proper church life: the body, the mind, which is the main part of the soul, and the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Body Presented for the Church Life</h2>
<p>Once we rely on Christ and He takes possession of our whole being, our body is released from the usurping hand of the enemy. When we lived independently, Satan could take possession of our body and force us to do things against our will. Now, as we rely on Christ, the strongest One, He releases our body from the enemy&rsquo;s usurping hand. Then what is the next step? We must present our body to the Lord (Rom. 12:1). This is one thing many dear Christian brothers and sisters have not yet done. We must present our body definitely to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You that my body, which was formerly a body of sin and a body under death, is now enlivened and released. I present this body to You for Your Body. If I keep my body in my hands, Your Body cannot be realized.&rdquo; If we are going to realize the Body of Christ, we must definitely and practically present our body to Christ.</p>
<p>In these days, while traveling from coast to coast, I have met a good number of Christians who are talking about the Body life. But how about our body? We talk much about the Body of Christ, but what are we doing with our body? Are we still keeping it in our own hands? As long as our body is kept in our hands, there is no possibility for us to realize the Body of Christ. In Romans 12 we are told that if we desire to realize the church life, we must first present our released body to the Lord. Since it is no longer our body, it must be presented to the Lord as a living sacrifice.</p>
<p>Do we come to the meetings with our heart or with our body? Many Christians say, &ldquo;I do have a heart for the church life.&rdquo; Yes, they may have a heart for the church life, but their body is not for the church life. Their body is left at home. We must be able to say, &ldquo;I not only have a heart for the church life, but I also have a body for the church life.&rdquo; Is our heart for the church life and our body for our private life? If so, how can we realize the church life? We can talk very nicely about the church life, but actually everything is just in the &ldquo;air&rdquo; and in the heart. In order to realize the church life, the life of Christ&rsquo;s Body, we must definitely present our body to the Lord. We must pray, &ldquo;Lord, formerly my body was under the usurping hand of the enemy. Now I thank You, You have released this body. I now present it to You. It is no longer my body but Your sacrifice.&rdquo; Then we will be able to realize the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Mind Renewed for the Church Life</h2>
<p>After we present our body to the Lord, the second thing for the realization of the church life must promptly take place. We must be transformed by the renewing of our mind (v. 2). Formerly, our mind always tried to do something by itself for God; now it relies on Christ. This mind that depends on the Lord must be renewed, enlightened, and reeducated.</p>
<p>The following is a real example. A brother who truly loved the Lord and the church life definitely offered his body as a sacrifice to the Lord and to the church. However, after he presented himself to the Lord, he became a big problem to the church. When he was indifferent about the church life, the church was at peace, but when his body came to the church, his mind came also, and his mind had not yet been renewed. The old things of Christianity had not yet been crossed out and purged. When he did not present his body, he was indifferent about the church. He said, &ldquo;If I have time and I feel like it, I will come to the meetings. If I don&rsquo;t, I simply won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; But later he loved the Lord more, and he presented himself to the Lord and the church. He put himself wholly into the church. But as his body came to the church, so did his troublesome mind, bringing with it many opinions, teachings, thoughts, and various considerations, which caused much trouble to the church life.</p>
<p>After our body is presented, our mind must be renewed. When we take our full share in the practical life of the church, we must have our mind purged, renewed, and reeducated. In order to have our mind renewed and reeducated, we need to drop all our old thoughts and natural ideas and all the teachings and considerations of traditional Christianity. This is what it means to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. Through such a transformation and renewing the church life is possible; otherwise, the mind will be the biggest problem and the greatest source of trouble in the church. Some dear ones have brought in many problems since they came into the church. Before they came, the church was very much at peace and in oneness, but since they came in, their minds have created trouble for the church. They may think that their heart is good, but actually their mind is terrible. Many old things need to be stripped off for the transforming of their mind.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Spirit Burning for the Church Life</h2>
<p>First of all, our body must be presented; then our mind, representing our soul, needs to be renewed; and finally, our spirit must be on fire, burning fervently. We need to be burning in spirit (v. 11). A dear brother might have presented his body to the Lord and to the church, and he may be entirely renewed in his mind, having dropped all the old thoughts, teachings, and considerations. However, he may be cold in his spirit. Such a brother is no longer a problem to the church, but he becomes a burden. Every time he comes to the meeting, he sits there as cold as a grave. He is always quiet and never troublesome, but the church must bear him as a burden. When responsibility is shared in the elders&rsquo; or deacons&rsquo; meeting, he just sits there. His attitude is, &ldquo;I am totally with you and I am for the church. I have no problem; whatever you brothers say is all right with me.&rdquo; Suppose all the responsible brothers are like this when they meet together. Who will bear the burden? All those brothers themselves become a burden; not one bears his share of the church&rsquo;s burden. On one hand, we should not be troublesome, but on the other hand, we need to be a &ldquo;troublemaker.&rdquo; In other words, we should have no variance, no crosscurrent, with the brothers, but we should be on fire. We should be burned and burning. We must be burning in our spirit.</p>
<p>The Christian life may seem to be individual and private, but actually it is not; it is a corporate life, a body life. You alone are not the Body; you are a member, and you need others as members in order to realize the church life. When we stop trying to do good by ourselves and learn to depend on Christ and live by Him, we are a living member and are prepared to be a functioning member of His Body. Then we need to realize the church life by definitely presenting our body to the Lord, by having our mind renewed, and by having our spirit on fire. When our body is presented, our soul is transformed, and our spirit is on fire, we will have the church life. We will be a living, functioning member, not a troublesome, cold, or dead member. We will not be a member out of function but a prevailing and aggressive member in function. We will have the reality of the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h1>
<p>There are many more important details to consider concerning the spirit and the soul, but now our attention must be focused on the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We have put much emphasis on the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We have seen that it was composed of the outer court and the two parts of the tent of the tabernacle&mdash;the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Let us briefly review the contents of these three places.</p>
<p>In the outer court there was the altar, which typifies the cross of Christ, and the laver, which typifies the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Holy Place contained the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. These three items are types of the various aspects of Christ as our life. The table of the bread of the Presence reveals Christ as our daily life supply&mdash;He is our very bread of life. The lampstand typifies Christ as the light of life. The supply of life that we enjoy becomes the light, which shines within us. Next, the incense altar typifies the resurrection savor of Christ.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies contained one thing, the Ark, a type of Christ Himself. There were three things within the Ark: the hidden manna, which is the inner life and the inner life supply; the hidden law, which is the inner enlightening within us; and the hidden rod with sprouted buds, which is the inner resurrection power and authority. The hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden authority are all in resurrection and are much deeper than the three corresponding items in the Holy Place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>All these things were the contents of the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. The experiences of all these eight items in the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies are the real contents of the true building of God, the church. If we desire to be the building as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we must experience what Christ has accomplished by His cross and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit. We must also adequately experience Christ as our life, our light, and our resurrection savor. Furthermore, we must have real experiences of Christ Himself as the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden authority. The experience of Christ in all these aspects forms the real content of the building of God and provides the very materials for the building.</p>
<p>In these last few years people have been talking much about the New Testament church. However, the New Testament church is not a church according to a certain pattern, but a church constituted of life and of the experience of Christ. We may attempt to manufacture a man according to the pattern of another man by making an arm out of wax, a head out of marble, a torso out of wood, and legs and feet out of clay. Once these are put together in the exact size and shape and painted the exact color, we may have a true pattern of that man, but we do not have the reality of that man. The real man was not manufactured according to a certain pattern, but was born and matured by the growth of life. This man was first born of a living mother and then grew by receiving daily nourishment. Ultimately, he became a man with a certain form. If a man is produced by any other means, the result will be a &ldquo;man&rdquo; in a certain pattern, but not a real man.</p>
<p>One time when we were in Pittsburgh, I said to a friend, &ldquo;Let us forget about the pattern and pay full attention to life. For example, you have a nice little boy. You don&rsquo;t pay much attention to his outward form. You don&rsquo;t try to shape him day by day in a particular way. First, he is born of his mother, and then you nourish him with milk and baby food. The baby then grows and grows, assuming a certain shape and pattern. That pattern comes out of his birth and the growth of life. Just as you could do nothing to form your child, neither can we form a New Testament church. If we try to form a church, all we will have is a pattern without life. It is possible for us to form a church according to a certain pattern, but we cannot form a church of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last few years I have been continually urging people and pleading with people, telling them, &ldquo;Do not form anything.&rdquo; Whatever we form is not the real church. Not one living person on this earth through the past six thousand years has been formed; every one was born and grew in life. The church is the Body of Christ, and no human hand can form it. We can form many things, but we cannot form a living Body composed of living members. We are never commanded or instructed in the New Testament to form the church, but we are exhorted to experience Christ, to minister Christ to others, and to bring forth many children by spiritual birth. The real church, the Body of Christ, comes only out of spiritual birth and the growth of life. This is why we stress the principle that the tabernacle comes out of the experience of its contents.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEPARATION OF THE OUTER COURT</h2>
<p>Based on this principle, let us see what the main materials of the tabernacle were. First of all, there was the separating wall of the outer court (Exo. 27:9-19; 38:9-20). This wall was like a fence surrounding a property, separating and keeping it from all that is outside. The wall of the outer court was made of three main things: 1) the bronze sockets, 2) the bronze pillars, and 3) the hangings made of fine twined linen. The base of the separating wall consisted of the sockets of bronze. There were twenty sockets on the north side, another twenty on the south side, ten on the west side at the rear, and ten at the front&mdash;altogether sixty sockets of bronze. In each of these sockets stood a pillar, and all the pillars were connected and united with connecting rods. The hangings on the pillars were made of fine linen, twined together with two threads. Therefore, the three main components of the wall were the bronze sockets, the bronze pillars, and the hanging of fine twined linen.</p>
<p>The bronze that formed the base of the separating wall was of the same material as that of the two items located within the outer court: the bronze altar and the bronze laver. The spiritual meaning is that the bronze sockets come from the experience of the altar and the laver. Both the altar and the laver were made of bronze; therefore, all the sockets of the separating wall were made of bronze. The components of the outer court made of bronze were the altar, the laver, and the sockets. The immediate impression people received when they came into the outer court was that the base of the separating wall was bronze, the same material that the altar and the laver were made of. This means that the experiences of the cross and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit are the very base for the separation of the Lord&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>We know that bronze typifies God&rsquo;s divine judgment. All that we have, all that we are, and all that we do must be put on the altar to be judged. The altar, or the cross, is first a place of judgment; God judged everything on the cross. According to Numbers 16:38-39, the bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty rebellious people. When these people who rebelled against God and Moses were judged with fire, God told Moses to pick up all their bronze censers to make a cover for the altar as a memorial. This was a memorial of God&rsquo;s judgment on the rebellious ones. In order to realize the building of the church, all that we have, all that we can do, and all that we are need to be judged by the cross of Christ. This issues in the sockets of the separating wall of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>We may be clear concerning the principle of separation, but we may not be able to apply it. To illustrate this principle, suppose I am a brother who was saved in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Through the preaching of the gospel I heard that I was a sinner, that Christ loved me, and that He died on the cross. As a result, I admitted that I was a sinner. I prayed, &ldquo;O God, forgive me, for I am sinful. I thank You that You have given Your Son, the Lord Jesus, to die on the cross for me. I praise You that He is my Savior and that my sins are forgiven. Hallelujah! I have joy and peace within me.&rdquo; Of course, I then went to a pastor, who was a good friend of mine, and allowed him to baptize me. After being baptized, I became a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of his church.</p>
<p>Suppose further that one day the Lord opened my eyes to see why He saved me. He saved me for a purpose&mdash;that I might be built up together with others to become the dwelling place of God. After hearing a group of believers in my locality talk about the Body life and the building up of the church, I was willing to be built up with them in the Body life. Finally, the Holy Spirit said to me, &ldquo;Do you come to be built up? Do you come to realize the church life? If so, you must first go to the cross. All that you can do, all that you are, and all that you have must be judged on the cross.&rdquo; I then had to confess and repent, saying, &ldquo;Lord, nothing of me is acceptable to You, and nothing is good for Your building. Everything must be judged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we do not follow through with the judgment of the cross, it will be impossible for us to be built up with others; there will be no base, no foundation. If we come into the church in a proud way, it will be possible for us to be organized, but it will be impossible for us to be built up in the church. The foundation, as seen in the sockets of the separating wall of God&rsquo;s building, comes from the experience of the bronze altar. Thus, the solid foundation of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place comes from the experience of the cross. There is no other way. Everything must be put on the altar and must be burned and judged. At the main entrance of the church is the cross. In order for us to enter into the church, we must put ourselves on the altar of the cross.</p>
<p>When our whole being and all our actions have been put on the cross, we can testify how dirty, how worldly, and how sinful we are. We realize that we need not only Christ&rsquo;s redemption but also the cleansing of the Holy Spirit. One day, according to my inner sense, I felt like jumping into the laver. I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, cleanse me. I am sinful, I am worldly. Every bit of me is dirty. I need the cleansing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; By releasing this burden in prayer, I experienced the cross and the laver. At the cross we put everything of ourselves to death, and at the laver we put everything under the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit. This makes us not only pure but also purged. Then we will come humbly to the church by His mercy, by His redemption, and by His cleansing. After a brother experiences the altar and the laver, and after he is purified from all pride and self-righteousness, he has the base, the sockets of bronze, in which the pillars of the separating wall are erected.</p>
<p>The Scriptures tell us that the pillars also were made of bronze (Exo. 27:10a). Furthermore, we are told that the hooks and the connecting rods that fastened the pillars together and the overlaying of the capitals of the pillars were all of silver (v. 10b; 38:17). Silver typifies redemption. This signifies that for God&rsquo;s building we are all joined and united together and covered by nothing other than the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. In order to practice the church life, we need to realize that it is by the Lord&rsquo;s redemption that we are united, and under this redemption we are covered that we may be separated for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>On the pillars were also the hangings of fine twined linen, giving people the testimony that the church is pure and clean in conduct and behavior. This is the separating line. When the tabernacle was erected with the surrounding separating line, one could see from afar the white linen that demarcated it. That is the testimony of the church to a world that is in darkness. The whole world is black, but the linen hangings erected as the separating line of God&rsquo;s building testify that the church is clean, pure, and white. This kind of testimony can come only from the judgment of the altar and the cleansing of the laver, which results in a pure behavior and unsullied conduct before the world. This is the fine twined linen that hung on the supporting pillars, which were based on the sockets of bronze. This is the separating line testifying that the church is purged from the world. Outside this line everything is black, but within this line everything is white.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BOARDS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>Although this is good, it is only the experience of the outer court. There are a number of good things in the outer court: bronze, silver, and white linen. However, there is nothing of gold, which typifies the divine nature. This means that when we are in the outer court, nothing of the divine nature has yet been wrought into us that can be expressed. There is only the judging and purging away of the negative things. In other words, as a result of the judging and purging in the outer court, a brother who was proud when he came to the church becomes very humble and seems to have no self-righteousness, self-glory, and pride. But this is merely in the realm of human conduct and the purifying of one&rsquo;s conduct. At this stage there is nothing of God wrought into this brother that can be expressed&mdash;there is no gold manifested. This situation is good on the outside, but it is only the outer court, not the building. It is still in the open air, with no shelter, no covering, and no building. We need something divine to be mingled with our nature. We need the mingling of divinity with humanity. Therefore, we must press on from the outer court to the Holy Place and even to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>If by the mercy and grace of the Lord we entered into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, nearly everywhere we would have seen gold&mdash;the golden table, the golden lampstand, the golden incense altar, the golden Ark, and golden boards. All the surroundings were gold, the contents were gold, and every piece of the utensils was gold. What is the meaning of this? The wood of the boards (26:15) signifies humanity, the human nature, and the gold overlaying the boards (v. 29) signifies divinity, the divine nature. In the boards of the tabernacle divinity and humanity became one. On one hand, the boards were wood, and on the other hand, they were overlaid with gold. Within the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, divinity is mingled with humanity. That is why the two places are called the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, for anything holy must be of God. In the outer court we are righteous but not holy. Every aspect of our behavior and conduct in the outer court is right, for it is judged at the cross and purified at the laver. There is righteousness there but not holiness, which is the divine nature wrought into man. Not until we enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies do we see everything overlaid with gold. Nearly everything, every part, has the element of wood, but it is overlaid with gold. Humanity is there, but it is mingled with the divine nature.</p>
<p>Unless we enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies and have something divine wrought into us, it is impossible for us to be the boards built up together as the dwelling place of God. The church is built with the mingling of God and man. The mingling of God Himself with us becomes the very material for the building up of the Body of Christ. No matter how much we have been purified, we can only be white linen; we cannot be the boards for the building of the tabernacle. But the more we are overlaid with gold, the more we become the materials for the building of God. This is the reason that we must enter into our spirit, exercise our spirit, walk according to the spirit, and always be mingled with the Lord in our spirit. It is by this mingling of divinity with humanity that we become the materials for the building of the house of God.</p>
<p>The boards overlaid with gold in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies stood on silver sockets (v. 19), which means that Christ&rsquo;s redemption is the base and foundation for the building of God&rsquo;s house. But where does the gold for the boards come from? It comes from the experiences of the golden table, the golden lampstand, the golden incense altar, and the golden Ark. The more we experience Christ as our life, as our light, and as our resurrection savor, and the more we experience Christ Himself in the deepest way, the more the divine nature is wrought into us. The gold that overlays the boards comes from the very experience of the contents of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The divinity that is mingled with our humanity comes only from the experience of Christ as our life, our light, and our resurrection savor, and even from the deepest experience of Christ Himself. This forms the materials for God&rsquo;s building. We must experience Christ daily as our manna, our light, and our resurrection savor, and we must experience Christ Himself in the deepest way, in order to gain the divine mingling.</p>
<p>In order to be built up, there are at least three other things that we must be clear about. First each board was one and a half cubits wide (v. 16). We must realize that we are only one and a half cubits and no more. There were forty-eight boards in the tabernacle, which were combined in pairs, each pair of boards measuring three cubits in width. The reason that each board was only one and a half cubits wide is that each was only half the full measure and needed to be matched by another board. We must realize that we are only a half. When the Lord Jesus sent His disciples, He always sent them out by twos (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). Peter needed John, and John needed Peter. We are only a half, and we need another half to complete us. We should never act and work independently or individually. All our service and function in the church must be accomplished in a corporate way. Two boards must be put together. We are not a complete whole; we need another half. Who is your other half? We must realize that each one of us is not three cubits but simply one and a half cubits. We cannot go alone; we cannot serve individually; we cannot function and work independently. We must be a coordinated member in the building of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each board had two tenons, two extra parts extending into the sockets (Exo. 26:19). Why were there two tenons instead of one for each board? One tenon would have allowed a board to spin around, but two tenons held it firmly in place. Two means confirmation. To illustrate, a human being has two feet. If a man stands on one foot, it will be easy for him to turn or fall, but if he stands on two feet, it will not be easy for him to fall, and it will be awkward for him to turn around. God&rsquo;s building does not need many &ldquo;turning around&rdquo; brothers. In the morning such a brother may be facing one direction, and in the afternoon he may face the opposite direction. By the next morning he may have turned yet another way. He is always turning around. It is difficult for us to know in what direction such a brother is facing. We may say that he is always spinning around on one tenon. With such unstable brothers and sisters there can be no building. In order for them to be built up, they must become stable. No matter what happens, they must stand in their place until they die. When a person is willing to sacrifice his life, the building of the church is possible. We need others to match us, and we need their confirmation continually.</p>
<p>In addition to the boards, there were bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold and rings of gold that connected and united all the boards together as one (vv. 26-29). The rings represent the Holy Spirit. We received the Holy Spirit as the rings at the very beginning of our Christian life, when we were regenerated (Luke 15:22; Gen. 24:47). The rings held the bars, which also typify the Holy Spirit, but with the human nature, signified by the acacia wood within the overlaying gold. As we have already seen, after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven with both the divine nature and the human nature; thus, He is now the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7). It is this wonderful Holy Spirit with both the divine nature and the human nature who combines and unites us together. Through the rings and bars all the boards of the tabernacle became one. Suppose all the gold had been removed from the boards, the rings, and the bars. Then, with all the gold stripped away, all the boards would have become disconnected individual pieces. The oneness of the boards was not in the wood but in the gold. If the gold had been taken away, there would have been no uniting element, and the boards would have been left as separate and individual pieces. By this picture we can clearly see that the unity, the oneness, the building up, of the boards was not in the wood but wholly in the gold. This means that the building up of the church is not in the human nature but in the divine nature. It is in the divine nature that we are all built together. It is the divine nature that joins us, unites us, and holds us together as one.</p>
<p>You and I must learn, first of all, that we are only a half. Second, we must never act independently and individually without the confirmation of others. Finally, we must act, live, and serve in the divine nature. It is in the divine nature that we as the boards are united together as one. In such a oneness by the divine nature, we will have the building of God. Again, it must be repeated that all of this comes from the experience of Christ as the bread, as the lampstand, as the resurrection savor, and as the very Ark, including the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden rod. How meaningful this is! May the Lord fully, deeply, and wholly impress us with this picture. This is the right way for us to be built up together as the dwelling place of God. The church is not a matter of conforming to a certain pattern; rather, it is produced by the real experience of Christ as our life and everything. Therefore, the only way for the church to be built up among us is for us to experience Christ in our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE COVERING OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<p class="indent1">Now the tabernacle you shall make with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet strands; you shall make them with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman. (Exo. 26:1)</p>
<p class="indent1">And you shall make curtains of goats&rsquo; hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains you shall make...And you shall make a covering for the tent, of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above it. (vv. 7, 14)</p>
<p>From the above passages we learn that there were four layers that formed the covering of the tabernacle. The first layer consisted of ten curtains of fine linen; the second was composed of curtains of goats&rsquo; hair; the third was a covering of rams&rsquo; skins; and the fourth was the outside covering of porpoise skins. These four layers of covering formed the roof of the tabernacle. Much has been written by others concerning the tabernacle and its covering, but my burden is to point out how this covering is related to the Lord&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BUILT BY CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the Lord&rsquo;s building is not merely a matter of conforming to a pattern, but a matter of Christ being wrought into humanity. The building of the church cannot be manufactured with human hands, by imitating a pattern or by forming an organization. Of course, by the divine birth and the growth in life a certain pattern will spontaneously come forth, just as the size and shape of a man evolve as a result of his birth and growth in life. No one can manufacture or fashion a man to his mature form. Likewise, the building of the church is not a man-made pattern, not a manufactured imitation, but the spontaneous growth of Christ as our life.</p>
<p>Every part and every aspect of the tabernacle typifies either the work or the person of Christ&mdash;it is much more than a pattern. The tabernacle shows that by means of His redemptive work Christ Himself must be wrought into us as everything. The altar in the outer court typifies the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross, which has ushered us into a right relationship with God. Confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by Christ&rsquo;s death, we receive Christ as our life. Then the cleansing and purging work of His Spirit, typified by the laver, purifies us from the dirt of the world in order to make us fit and suitable for Him to be wrought into us.</p>
<p>After these two items, we can then look at the building of the tabernacle. Immediately, we see that in everything the tabernacle manifests Christ as having been wrought into us. Nearly everywhere in the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies there was wood overlaid with gold, signifying that the human nature is overlaid with the divine nature, that divinity has been wrought into and upon humanity. The table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, the incense altar, the Ark, all the boards that form the framework of the tabernacle, and even the four layers of the covering reveal and emphasize one thing: Christ as the very embodiment of God has been wrought into us that we may experience Him as life and as everything.</p>
<p>The Lord must open our eyes and impress us with all these things. We cannot merely find a pattern from the book of Acts, set up elders and deacons, and call this the church. This is not the church; this is an imitation of the church. If we ask someone how he came into being and became such a tall person, he will tell us, &ldquo;I was born of my mother, I have eaten a great deal of nourishing food, and I have grown up to such a height.&rdquo; We can manufacture a toy or a doll, but there is no way for us to manufacture a man. The church is a real man; no one can make a church. It must be something out of the new birth in the Spirit and the growth of life in Christ. We must say again and again that we should keep our hands off. We should not try to form or organize anything.</p>
<p>In many places during the past few years I have pleaded in this way, yet not many brothers realize what I mean. They say, &ldquo;If we do not form a church, if we do not organize anything, what should we do?&rdquo; We should do one thing: eat Christ and drink of Christ (John 6:57; 7:37). Moreover, we need to be swallowed up by Christ. The more we feast on Him, the more we will be swallowed up by Him. We think that we are only feeding on Him and enjoying Him, but actually the more we feed on Him, the more we are being swallowed up by Him. The church cannot be formulated and organized. It must be born of Christ in the Spirit; it must be the living Body of Christ grown up with the life of Christ. As a result, it will spontaneously assume a certain shape, and a pattern will be seen. The church grows with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ (Eph. 2:21; 4:16; Col. 2:19).</p>
<p>In the outer court we experience the accomplished work of Christ, which is the means for us to enter into the Holy Place. The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are not a matter of experiencing the work of Christ but of experiencing Christ Himself. In these two places Christ Himself is experienced as food for the supply of life, as the light of life, as the resurrection savor, and as the all-inclusive One. Once Christ is worked into us, the materials will be available for the building of the church. Then we will be united and built up together into one through the Holy Spirit, who regenerates and matures us (as portrayed in the gold rings and the gold-overlaid bars). This is the Body of Christ, and this is the dwelling place of God. Again we repeat: the building of the church is a matter of growth, which is Christ being progressively wrought into us as our everything. This alone produces the materials for the building of the church. Through the process of regeneration and maturing by the Spirit, all the materials will be fitly framed together and united as a whole. This building in oneness is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH COVERED BY CHRIST<br />
AS THE EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>However, we must realize that even up to this stage the tabernacle is still without a roof to cover it. Regardless of the degree to which we have been wrought into Christ and Christ has been wrought into us, we are only the boards&mdash;none of us can become the covering. If we are the covering, the church will become the expression of man. Only Christ can be the covering, for the church must be the expression of only Christ Himself. In the type of the tabernacle, as we have seen, the roof consisted of four layers, and every layer signifies an aspect of Christ. The entire roof is a revelation of Christ as the unique covering. The tabernacle thus becomes an expression of Christ through this covering, which covered the tabernacle completely. After the covering was put on the tabernacle, nothing but the covering could be seen from the outside. Even the boards and the utensils were inside the covering. This covering not only protected all the boards and utensils in the tabernacle; it also expressed the whole tabernacle. In fact it was the expression that protected all the boards and utensils. This means that if we do not have Christ as our expression, we do not have His protection. If we expect Christ to protect the church, we must have Him as our expression.</p>
<p>In some places it seems that the church is not covered by Christ, but rather by some kind of doctrine. In other places the covering is the manifestation of certain kinds of gifts&mdash;gifts have become the roof. Different groups of believers are either under the covering of teachings or under the covering of gifts; they are not under the covering of Christ. But the gifts and the teachings can never protect us. No gifts, no teachings, and no doctrines are adequate to cover a group of believers. Only Christ must be uplifted; only Christ must be exalted; only Christ must be expressed as the roof to cover us.</p>
<p>If we read the measurements of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:1-14), we will discover that the covering included not only the roof but also the two sides. From the outside nothing could be seen but the covering. The sockets, the boards, and the contents within were not visible. This means that those outside must see only Christ as the covering of the church. When people came inside the tabernacle, in type they saw nothing but the mingling of Christ with man. Outside they saw nothing but Christ, and inside they saw nothing but Christ wrought into and mingled with humanity. In other words, when I am outside looking at the church, I see only Christ, and when I come inside the church and look at the people, I see the mingling of Christ with every believer. This is the genuine church. From without people can see nothing but Christ, and from within they see nothing but Christ wrought into many persons.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful picture. If I had more than ten Epistles like Romans, twelve like 1 and 2 Corinthians, and sixty like Ephesians, without this picture I could not be so clear. I am like a simple little child, still needing pictures and drawings. When we teach children in kindergarten, we need some pictures. For example, merely spelling the word <em>cat</em> to the children does not convey what the word means. We need to bring a picture of a cat and show it to them. Likewise, by beholding the picture of the tabernacle, we can understand the real building of the church. It is not a matter of a pattern or an organization, nor is it any kind of formation by human hands; rather, the church is Christ wrought into many persons, and these persons uplift Christ and exalt Christ and put on Christ as their expression in order to cover and protect themselves.</p>
<p>Now let us look into the four layers of the covering. From inside the tabernacle the first layer was of the finest materials&mdash;curtains of fine twined linen with embroidery of cherubim and beautiful colors of blue, purple, and scarlet wrought into them (Exo. 26:1). Blue signifies that which is heavenly, purple denotes royalty, and scarlet signifies the blood of Christ shed for redemption. The basic material, however, was fine linen, which symbolizes the humanity of Christ with all His fine characteristics and behavior. The four Gospels give a record of a man with both His human nature and His conduct exactly like fine linen. The curtains of the tabernacle were fine yet very strong, and because they were made of twined linen, they were doubled in strength. The Lord Jesus is very fine, yet He is strong; there is nothing in Him that is crude or weak.</p>
<p>The embroidery of cherubim means that God&rsquo;s glory is manifested in His creature. The cherubim typify God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 9:5), and the embroidered work of the cherubim on the fine linen means that God&rsquo;s glory has been wrought into humanity and into His creature. While Jesus was on the earth, we can realize that in this man with His fine human nature and character God&rsquo;s divine glory was wrought into His creature. He was a real man with a fine human nature and conduct, but He was also the embodiment of the glory of God wrought into His creature. He as man is the very effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (1:3). In other words, upon Him cherubim are embroidered. Can you follow this kind of language? He is not only human but also divine. His human nature bears the divine glory. We cannot exhaust this matter, but we must go on.</p>
<p>The second layer of covering consisted of goats&rsquo; hair. In the types of the Scriptures, goats signify sinners. Matthew 25:31-46 speaks of the division and difference between the sheep and the goats, and the goats are shown to be sinful people. This corresponds exactly to 2 Corinthians 5:21: God made the One who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf. Therefore, the layer of curtains made of goats&rsquo; hair typifies Christ, who was made sin for us. Although He is fine linen, He was made &ldquo;goats&rsquo; hair.&rdquo; He had no sin and did not know sin, but He was made sin for us.</p>
<p>Following the layer of goats&rsquo; hair was a layer of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red. The color red signifies the shedding of blood in Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work. Christ is the sinless One who was made sin on our behalf to bear our sins. This simple sentence explains the first three layers. The first layer typifies Christ as the sinless One, the second layer signifies that He was made sin for us, and the third layer signifies that He bore our sins and shed His blood to redeem us.</p>
<p>After the rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, there was the fourth layer, which constituted the outer covering of the tabernacle. This covering was formed of porpoise skins, which are very strong. It could withstand any kind of weather. This signifies that Christ as our covering enables us to stand against Satan and all his attacks. The outer covering of porpoise skins was not attractive in appearance and was somewhat rough. Today Christ is not outwardly pleasant to the worldly people. As a man, His outward appearance was unappealing, like that of strong porpoise skins (Isa. 53:2). However, although He is not comely without, He is beautiful, wonderful, and heavenly within. He is not like today&rsquo;s Christianity with its great, beautiful buildings&mdash;outwardly pretentious but inwardly and spiritually ugly, empty, and sometimes corrupted. The worldly Christian organizations are indeed ugly. Within the proper church, the building of God, there is something heavenly and beautiful, yet on the outside the church is humble and rough, having no comeliness or beauty.</p>
<p>I wish to take this opportunity to say that we all must try to hide ourselves. We must never put a picture of ourselves in the newspaper. That is not something of the church but something entirely of the fallen, worldly religion of Christianity. If possible, we should not allow anyone to advertise our name in the newspaper. The Lord Jesus never advertised Himself. We read in the four Gospels how He always tried to hide Himself and, if possible, to keep Himself hidden (Matt. 8:4; 9:30; 12:15-19). Our beauty and comeliness must be the experience of Christ in our spirit. That is the real beauty before God (cf. 1 Pet. 3:3-4).</p>
<p>I would take this opportunity to say a further word, concerning the building of meeting halls. If possible, we should build a meeting hall that is very plain and simple in appearance. We should not build a luxurious and beautiful meeting hall. It is not possible to attract people to the Lord by beautiful external buildings. I was in Rome once and saw Saint Peter&rsquo;s Cathedral. I cannot tell you how many millions of dollars the building is worth or how many people are drawn there daily. When I was there, it was crowded. But I am afraid that not one person out of a thousand was a saved one. What is the advantage of drawing people by such means? I would say that it would be better if this kind of building did not exist. It is not a pleasure but an offense to the Lord.</p>
<p>My emphasis, however, is not on these matters but on the very Christ who is full of beauty within and is simple and humble without. Such a Christ must be the expression of our testimony and the covering of the church. This is not man&rsquo;s opinion or thought; this is the picture shown by the Word of God. We must not put up anything else as an expression. We must lift up and exalt only our wonderful Christ as the covering of God&rsquo;s building&mdash;a Christ within who is full of divine comeliness, and a Christ without who is simple and humble in the eyes of the world. It is the church with such a covering that can endure any assault and stand against any temptation. Once the attack of the enemy comes, those in the beautiful buildings of the so-called Christian churches will be the first to fall. Only those who do not bear any outward show but have the heavenly beauty and divine comeliness within them will endure to the end. Christ is their content and their covering. Nothing can damage or overcome the genuine building of the church covered with such a Christ (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<p>Let us learn to put these things into practice and to seek Christ in our spirit. Let us learn to discern our spirit and experience Christ as everything to us. If we will do these things, we will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13) and become available material to be built up with others as the building of God covered by Christ as the expression. Then there will be a proper, strong church that can withstand any attack, endure any trial, and overcome any temptation for the ultimate glory of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h1>
<p class="indent1">If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory. (1 Tim. 3:15-16)</p>
<p>Three aspects of the church are mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:15: the house of God, the church of the living God, and the pillar and base of the truth. Verse 16 continues by speaking of the great mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH&mdash;THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Why is the church mentioned together with the manifestation of God in the flesh? It is because the church is the house of God. When we speak of a person&rsquo;s house, we refer to the place where he dwells, where he lives, where he works out his life. The expression <em>the house of God</em> carries the same meaning. It is not a light or loose expression. The house of God is the place where God dwells, where He lives, and where He works out His life.</p>
<p>The house of God is none other than the church of the living God. Here God is referred to not merely as God but as the living God. God is living, and now He dwells in the church, moves in the church, lives in the church, and works out His whole life in the church. When we say that the church is the house of God, we must have a very deep realization that God dwells, lives, and works out His life in this house. We need to have such a deep understanding concerning the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH&mdash;THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>This church is not only the house of God, in which God dwells, lives, and works out His life, but it is also the pillar and base of the truth. What is truth? Do not think that truth is merely doctrine. The word <em>truth</em> in such a passage means &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; Nothing is real in the whole universe. Nothing is the truth; everything is only a shadow. Everything that can be seen, everything that can be touched, everything that can be possessed and enjoyed is not real but is at best a shadow. Whatever exists in this universe is only a shadow; it is not the real thing.</p>
<p>What is the real thing? It is Christ as the reality of every positive thing. The food we eat is not the real food but only a shadow of the real food. The real food is Christ. If we do not have Christ, we do not have the reality of food. We may think that the human life we have is real, but it is not the real life; it too is only a shadow. The real life is Christ (John 11:25). If we have the Son of God, we have life; if we do not have the Son of God, we do not have life (1 John 5:12).</p>
<p>If a brother sends you a photo of himself, you may say, &ldquo;This is Brother So-and-so.&rdquo; But in truth, that is not Brother So-and-so. It is only a picture, a photograph of the brother. In fact, all pictures are false, for there is nothing real in a picture. The entire universe is nothing but a picture. All the types, all the figures, and all the shadows in the Old Testament were only pictures of the reality to come, which is Christ Himself (Col. 2:16-17). Christ is the truth; Christ is the reality of the entire universe; Christ is the reality of the Old Testament and also of the New Testament. If we have only the teaching concerning Christ, we do not have the reality of Christ. Christ Himself is the reality (John 14:6), and His Spirit is the Spirit of reality (v. 17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6). He Himself is the reality, and His Spirit is the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>The church, in which the living God dwells, lives, and moves, is the pillar and base on which the reality stands. The church bears the reality. Within this church the living God dwells, and on this church the truth, the reality, stands. We are not standing for doctrine; rather, we are standing for Christ, the reality, the truth. We should be able to say, &ldquo;Friends, come and see; come to the church and see the reality of the universe. Come and see the reality of life, the reality of love, the reality of patience, and the reality of many other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon in 1933 while I was visiting Brother Watchman Nee, he suddenly asked, &ldquo;Brother, what is patience?&rdquo; At first, I thought this was a childish question. I was taught what patience was when I was a small child. But since the question came from his mouth, I felt that I should not take it lightly; so I considered further: &ldquo;What does he mean, &lsquo;What is patience?&rsquo;&rdquo; I dared not answer. He was sitting in a rocking chair, rocking back and forth. Finally I ventured, &ldquo;Patience is something by which one suffers and endures the ill-treatment of others. That is patience.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;Well, brother, if patience is not endurance, please tell me what it is.&rdquo; As he continued to rock in his chair, he continued asking, &ldquo;What is patience? What is patience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long period, he suddenly answered, &ldquo;Patience is Christ.&rdquo; It was very short and very simple. &ldquo;Patience is Christ.&rdquo; I simply could not understand this kind of &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; language. I said, &ldquo;Brother, that sounds strange to me. I don&rsquo;t understand. Please tell me what you mean.&rdquo; He would not say anything else but kept repeating, &ldquo;Patience is Christ; patience is Christ.&rdquo; For the whole afternoon we did not talk about anything else. I was more than puzzled.</p>
<p>After three or four hours I left him, very much disappointed. Returning to my room, I knelt down and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, tell me what it means that &lsquo;patience is Christ.&rsquo; I cannot understand.&rdquo; Finally, the Lord showed me that our patience must be Christ Himself. Patience is Christ living within me and through me. When I saw this, it was a real revelation. I was very happy.</p>
<p>We must realize that human patience, which we can attain by ourselves, is not the real patience. Human patience is only a form and a shadow; the real patience is Christ. Everything that we need&mdash;patience, humility, kindness, love for others, and even love for God&mdash;must be found in Christ Himself. Even the Ten Commandments are merely a shadow; Christ is the reality. If we have Christ living out through us, we have the reality and fulfillment of all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>The church must bear the truth, the reality. The church must be the pillar and base of this universal reality, which is Christ Himself. We must be able to tell others, &ldquo;Come to the church and see the real patience and the real humility. Come to us and see the real faithfulness and the reality of being honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the church God dwells, because the church is the house of God. God lives, God moves, and God works out His life in the church. Furthermore, the testimony and the reality stand upon the church. We must consider these two aspects&mdash;inwardly, God&rsquo;s dwelling in the church, and outwardly, the church bearing the testimony and the reality. These two aspects show the real mingling of God with man. Within the church&mdash;this group of redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people&mdash;God dwells; and upon this group of people there is the reality of the universe. All the reality of the universe is centered in this group. If anyone wants to know what life is, he must come to the church and see. If some would like to know what love is, they too must come and see. If the reality of humility and kindness is to be known, the church is the place to see it. Upon this group of people is seen the reality of the all-inclusive Christ. The testimony of the church is not in doctrine but in bearing Christ as the reality. The more we exclaim &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; yet do not have the inner reality, the more Christ is gone. Without the inner reality, we have Christ only in shouting, in talking, and in teaching. We do not have Him in our inner life, nor do we experience Him in our outer living, our daily walk. The church must be the pillar and base, bearing Christ as the unique reality of everything. If we do not know the real meaning of life, we must be able to come to the church to find it.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH&mdash;THE MANIFESTATION<br />
OF GOD IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>This is the right meaning of the expressions <em>the house of God</em> and <em>the pillar and base of the truth.</em> The church is the continuation and the multiplication of God manifested in the flesh. This is the reason that the apostle Paul put these two verses together. The manifestation of God in the flesh has very much to do with the church being the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. When we are the living Body of Christ in a certain place, we are truly the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. We are then the increase, the enlargement, of the manifestation of God in the flesh. God manifests Himself again in the flesh, but in a wider way. The principle of the New Testament is the principle of incarnation, which is simply God Himself manifested in the flesh. In other words, God is mingled with human beings, not in an outward way but in an inward way. The church is the manifestation of God, not the manifestation of doctrines or gifts. The church must be the manifestation of God in Christ through the Spirit, not the demonstration of doctrines or gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BUILT BY OUTWARD CHANGE</h2>
<p>We are burdened because we fear that many brothers and sisters unconsciously think that we are going to form a new movement or train people to form a new pattern for the church. This is our real concern. We must all look to the Lord that this kind of thought and understanding may be entirely abandoned. It must be fully purged out of our blood. We are not here with the intention of forming a new movement. This is absolutely not our intention. If we do this, it simply proves that we do not know God&rsquo;s economy. I must stress again and again that the church is not something formed according to a certain pattern. The living God dwelling in us is not a matter of doctrine. According to their daily walk, most Christians today do not know the way of the inner life and of Christ as their life. This troubles us and burdens us. When people gain a certain kind of realization or learn certain methods, they try to start something new where they live. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>What we need today is not merely a change of clothes but a change of blood. The natural blood must be changed. We need to change not only the outward way but also the inward life. Suppose a person was formerly a pastor with the title <em>Reverend.</em> Suppose he was even dressed in a clergyman&rsquo;s robe with his collar turned backwards. Suppose further that one day he received the light that all these things are wrong: the titles <em>Pastor</em> and <em>Reverend</em> are wrong, the collar turned backwards is wrong, and the black robe is wrong. As a result, he got rid of all these things; he crossed out the clergyman&rsquo;s title and began to wear ordinary clothes. After this, he went to work for the Lord at another place and in another way, without the title and without the robe. <p>Whether this is right or not, I do not want to say, but I do want to say one thing: we need to find out whether a real change has taken place within such a person. No doubt he dropped all the former things, but this change was too outward. Formerly, this person ministered by himself, by his natural life. At one point he had a change in the outward things, but has there been any change in his inward life? It is quite probable that he is still working and ministering for the Lord by the same life that he had when he used the title <em>Reverend</em> or <em>Pastor.</em> Though he had a real change outwardly, inwardly he might still be the same. Such a change as this simply becomes an outward movement. Formerly this person practiced the &ldquo;church&rdquo; by voting and forming an executive committee; then he dropped that practice and gathered a group of elders. Although this was a real change, nothing changed in the inner life. The outward change was not the result of an inward change in life; hence, it became simply another new religious movement.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must go beyond the change in the inner life and realize the church. The church is a mingling of God with man. The reason we have spoken so much concerning the soul, the spirit, and the heart is that this helps us to realize that God is our content and we are His containers. We must know how to adjust our heart so that we can open our heart and allow God to come in. Furthermore, we must know how to exercise our spirit in order to contact Him, contain Him, and even digest Him. If we eat steak for dinner, after this steak has been contained in our stomach for four hours, it will be digested and become the very constituent of our body. This is a true picture of the church. However, today&rsquo;s Christianity is more a religion than the reality of life. The need today is not merely a change of form outwardly but a change of life inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BUILT BY MERE TEACHINGS</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should not pay attention only to teachings. In order to help us, allow me to use a simple illustration. When I was a boy, I and many others studied in a Christian school and received a Christian education. We were taught with the stories of the Bible. Although we were not saved, most of us were brought into Christianity and learned the Christian doctrines. Many times we argued with people that Christianity was the right religion. The missionaries ministered all the doctrines and teachings to us. We learned that God is a God of three persons&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We learned that Christ was born of a virgin and lived, walked, and worked on the earth, and we even believed that He was resurrected. But if anyone asked us, &ldquo;Are you saved?&rdquo; we did not know the answer. To us God and Christ were only terms. I have to testify that at that time hardly any of the several hundred members in that church were clear concerning salvation. They were known, however, as Christians. Sometimes all the members of the church paraded on the streets, holding up crosses and singing &ldquo;Onward Christian Soldiers.&rdquo; I share this in order to illustrate how empty mere teachings are.</p>
<p>Today some insist on ministering a set of teachings such as predestination, man&rsquo;s free will, absolute grace, and eternal security. It is possible to minister all these teachings, but the life and the spirit within people may never be touched. To continue my testimony, one day a member of our family was saved, and later I was saved. We finally had a genuine touch with God, and life touched us deeply within and wrought a real change in us. Even our outward living and our outward walk were changed. The real change in our lives influenced others also to be saved. Thereafter we knew that we needed something more than teachings. All the teachings in the Scriptures should simply be a vehicle to transmit Christ into us. If they do not fulfill this purpose, we are desperately short of something.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BUILT BY MERE GIFTS</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to the matter of gifts. Many Christians today think that since they have certain gifts, they are quite spiritual. In fact, however, this is not so. If we read 1 Corinthians, we can see the condition of the Corinthian believers. They exercised the gifts very much, but did they have the real growth of life? No, they were fleshly and childish (3:1-3). Just as the teachings should be the means to convey Christ to others, so also the gifts should be the means only to convey Christ. God&rsquo;s intention today is not to give us many teachings and gifts but to minister and impart Christ into us.</p>
<p>I once met a person who was full of the knowledge of the Bible, but although he spoke concerning the Bible, he still had the habit of smoking. After speaking on the book of Matthew and the ten virgins for half an hour, he said, &ldquo;Excuse me; I need to smoke a little. I know this is wrong, but I am weak.&rdquo; Then he went into the book of Revelation and spoke of the ten horns, the seven heads, and the forty-two months. He had the strength to teach, but eventually he had to say, &ldquo;Excuse me, I need to smoke a little more.&rdquo; Though he was strong in Bible teaching, he was very weak in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>I also saw many people who spoke in tongues. After the demonstration of this gift, they were very careless in their daily living. Some were even more careless than unbelievers. It was easy for them to lose their temper at home. All these things simply prove one thing: that God&rsquo;s intention is not to give us teachings and gifts but to give us Christ, the living One. God uses teachings, when ministered in a proper way, to convey Christ to us. Sometimes He uses certain gifts as the means to minister Christ to us and to stir up people to receive Christ. But we all must realize that God&rsquo;s intention is that we know the living One, the Triune God, and experience Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament a donkey once spoke in a human language (Num. 22:21-30). That was a genuine speaking in tongues. I doubt whether all the tongues are as genuine today. I read an article recently in which the writer reported that he had contacted more than one hundred persons who spoke in tongues. He said that every one without exception doubted whether the tongue he spoke was genuine. Yet the writer still encouraged people not to doubt but to continue their experience. After I read that, I said to myself, &ldquo;At the time of Pentecost, did Peter doubt whether the tongue he spoke was genuine? Was there anyone at that time who had such doubts?&rdquo; But today, why do so many people question whether or not their tongue is genuine? The simple answer is that many tongues today are not genuine.</p>
<p> Even if you are speaking a genuine tongue, I must tell you that tongue-speaking is not life. Even King Saul received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (1 Sam. 19:22-24), but we should not think that he experienced life. On the contrary, his experience simply exposed him. After he received the outpouring of the Spirit, he made himself naked. This illustrates that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is different from life. Life is not the outpouring of the Spirit; rather, life is only Christ Himself in the Spirit.</p>
<p>I am not trying to criticize, but my burden is very heavy. When I see the desperate situation of the Lord&rsquo;s people, I do not know what to say or what to do. When Christians hear sound Bible teachings, they are very responsive. When they hear of spiritual gifts, many are stirred up. But when the inner life and the indwelling Christ are ministered, how great is their need for an inner revelation! The doctrines and the gifts are outward, but Christ is hidden within us. How the Lord&rsquo;s people need to know Christ as the indwelling One, who is living and powerful&mdash;converting, regulating, strengthening, refreshing, and always transforming and saturating us!</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BUILT BY POSITION</h2>
<p>We must also see that the building of the church is not a matter of position or responsibility but a matter of life in our inner being. It is not a matter of putting someone into a position, but a matter of the growth of the inner life unto maturity. Our inner being must be constituted with God through His inward working. The more we put people into a position, the more we will have nothing. But the more we help people to realize the growth in life, the more life will multiply. The growth of the inner life is the sure way of building up the church. Then through the matured life we will spontaneously be qualified to exercise responsibility.</p>
<p>Again we need to repeat: God&rsquo;s intention is to impart Christ into us and make Christ everything within us. God uses teachings to help some people, and He uses the gifts to help others, but these are not the main thing. Inner revelation is needed to see the goal of the living Christ dwelling within us. If we see this goal, wherever we meet together, we will be the living house of the living God. The living God will dwell, live, and work in us, and we will bear the testimony of Jesus, who is the reality of the entire universe. Then we will be the genuine manifestation of the living God in the flesh. This is the way of God&rsquo;s recovery today. Let us look to the Lord for the inner grace that we may have the reality of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VISION OF THE MARK OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h1>
<p>The economy of God with its mark was unveiled at the beginning of this book, but after reading all the foregoing chapters, it is still possible to miss this economy. In simple words, God&rsquo;s economy is to work Himself into us, and in order to accomplish this, He must do it in three persons&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. From the beginning of this book we have spent much time on this economy of the Triune God. God never intended to give us the doctrine of the Trinity in the Scriptures. The doctrine of the Divine Trinity only involves us in many different concepts. But the Scriptures do reveal how God accomplished His divine economy in three distinct persons.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the word <em>economy</em> in Greek means &ldquo;administration, stewardship, government, arrangement, dispensation.&rdquo; The word <em>dispensation</em> is used here without any thought of periods of time, but with the denotation of the dispensing of God into us. Again we repeat, God&rsquo;s intention is to dispense Himself into us. This intention is the center of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption. God created and redeemed man for this purpose, that man might be the container into which He could dispense Himself. In the entire universe&mdash;time, space, and eternity&mdash;the center of God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into humanity.</p>
<p>Eventually, the ultimate consummation of all God&rsquo;s work of creation, redemption, and transformation is the universal mingling of God with man. Thus, the New Jerusalem comes into existence as the ultimate result of all God&rsquo;s work as recorded in the sixty-six books of the Scriptures. This result is nothing other than the universal mingling of God with man. The New Jerusalem is a mingling of God Himself with a corporate body of people. At that time these people will no longer be natural, but every part and every aspect of their being will have been regenerated, transformed, and conformed by God and with God as life. They will have been transformed in nature and conformed in appearance to God Himself. In order to serve the Lord in a proper way, we need to have this vision. This vision is not new; it is the original vision from the beginning of the church age. But it must be new and renewed day by day in us. It must be the controlling vision of all our work, life, and activity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MARK OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH FOUR STEPS</h2>
<p>What is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy? First of all, the Father, who is the source, has put Himself into the Son. The Father with all His fullness has come forth in the person of the Son. The Son is both the embodiment and the expression of the Father (John 14:9-10); no one but the Son has ever seen God the Father (6:46). In the Son God has accomplished all that He planned through four major steps: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. These four steps have fulfilled all that God planned in eternity.</p>
<p>Through incarnation God was brought into man. God was brought into the human nature and lived in that nature for thirty-three and a half years on this earth. Whatever human sufferings there were on this earth, God suffered (Heb. 2:18; 4:15). It was not merely a man by the name of Jesus who suffered; rather, it was also God within this man who suffered.</p>
<p>The second step in the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s plan was crucifixion. All the twelve negative items listed in chapter 14, such as Satan, fallen man, sin, the world, death, etc., were brought to the cross and put to an end. All the negative things were terminated on the cross.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection followed His crucifixion. Resurrection recovered and uplifted the standard of the humanity created by God and brought the human nature into God. Through incarnation the divine nature was brought into man; through resurrection the human nature was brought into God. Now it is possible for man to have more than a created human nature, for the human nature has been regenerated, uplifted, and brought into God. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christ was exhibited to the whole universe as a &ldquo;model.&rdquo; In this model God is in man and man is in God. Since all the negative things have been dealt with and terminated by the cross, there is nothing negative in this model.</p>
<p>This model then ascended to the heavens and was enthroned with glory and authority. The human mind cannot apprehend this picture. At this point everything was accomplished; nothing was left unfinished. This model, who is God mingled with man and man mingled with God, ascended far above all things in space and in time. He transcended to the highest place in the universe and was enthroned with glory and authority (Acts 2:36; Matt. 28:18; Eph. 1:21-22; Heb. 2:9; 4:14; 7:26).</p>
<p>Then from this glorified One the Holy Spirit came like the outflow of a liquid composed of many elements (Acts 2:17-18, 33). The divine nature, the human nature, the human life, the human suffering, the death of the cross, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement are all elements included in the Holy Spirit. As we have seen, this wonderful outflow is the all-inclusive dose&mdash;whatever we need is in this dose. As this outflow the Holy Spirit has been poured into us (Rom. 5:5). On the day of resurrection and on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit who includes all the aforementioned elements, came into and upon the early Christians (John 20:22; Titus 3:5-6). On the one hand, this Spirit comes into us, and on the other hand, He comes upon us. In this way God in His three persons mingles Himself with us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MARK OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
OPERATING IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The mark of God&rsquo;s economy is this: God in three persons has come into us. The New Testament deals more with the fact that God in the Spirit has come into us than with the fact of His coming upon us. The little word <em>in&mdash;</em> referring to Christ being in us (Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27), Christ living in us (Gal. 2:20), Christ being formed in us (4:19), Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17), Christ abiding in us and we in Him (John 15:4), etc.&mdash;occurs many times in the New Testament. If you have time, you can count how many times this little word is used in the New Testament. God made man purposely with three parts so that He could come into man and man would fit His purpose. As we have seen, man is a tripartite being&mdash;body, soul, and spirit (1 Thes. 5:23)&mdash;corresponding to the tabernacle with its three parts&mdash;the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Only the innermost part, the Holy of Holies, was the place where God&rsquo;s shekinah glory dwelt and where the Ark as a type of Christ remained. This shows clearly that God and Christ have come to dwell in our spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22). Our spirit is our innermost part as the Holy of Holies within us.</p>
<p>We can trace this from the Scriptures very clearly, especially in 2 Timothy 4:22, which says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; Also, according to Ephesians 4:6, God the Father is in us, according to 2 Corinthians 13:5, God the Son is in us, and according to Romans 8:11, God the Spirit is in us. The Triune God in the persons of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is now in our spirit. This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy: the Triune God is in our spirit to be our life and our everything. How regrettable that God&rsquo;s economy has been neglected in the past centuries by His children! We must recover this mark of God in our spirit.</p>
<p>Using our spirit as His center, God works Himself out from our spirit into all our inward parts. The Triune God is in the center of our being. This is most wonderful! God came into the human nature, brought the human nature into the divine nature, and put an end to all negative things; now the Triune God and all that He has accomplished are in our spirit as our life and everything. From this central point the Triune God spreads out to saturate the inward parts of our being with Himself. The human spirit is the very spot of the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. If we miss this spot, we miss the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. I do not say that this is the goal of God&rsquo;s economy; rather, I say that it is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. This mark has been neglected by most Christians today. We may talk about many scriptural things and not hit this spot. In fact, we must realize that all the teachings of the sixty-six books of the Bible are for this mark. All the different gifts and all the different functions are for this mark and must be centered on this mark.</p>
<p>How can we realize the Triune God indwelling our spirit? How can we experience the indwelling Spirit in our spirit? We must realize that the Triune God is always operating within us (Phil. 2:13). He is operating within us, not merely outside of us. Furthermore, He is operating within us even more than He is operating upon us. The Greek word translated &ldquo;operates&rdquo; is equivalent to the English word <em>energizes.</em> The indwelling God is energizing within us all the time. He is also living within us through Christ, who lives in us (Gal. 2:20). In other words, the Triune God is within us today as our life (Col. 3:4). With this life there is also the inner law, the living law&mdash;not the law of letters but the law of life (Rom. 8:2). This divine law of life is always regulating us from within (Heb. 8:10). In addition to inwardly regulating us, the indwelling Triune God is anointing us within all the time (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>Let us consider these four words further&mdash;<em>operating, living,</em> regulating, and <em>anointing.</em> How much the church needs the inner revelation and experience of these four things! We should not consider these things as teaching, but we should experience the Triune God every day operating in us, living in us, regulating us, and anointing us. We should allow this wonderful Triune God to continually regulate us in our thinking, in our motives, in our words, in our attitudes, and in our relationships with others. Even our eating and our clothing should be regulated by Him. We must experience Him to such an extent and in such a practical way. This must not degrade into a doctrine; doctrine does not work. When we practice to experience the Triune God according to these four words, we will be revolutionized. We must realize that such a wonderful Christ is indwelling our spirit for the purpose of operating and living in us and regulating and anointing us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MARK OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
BUILDING UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If we do not experience Christ in such a practical way, it is absolutely impossible to build up the church. This is illustrated in the type of Eve, who was brought into being out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:30-32). Eve was a part of Adam, something out of Adam. Only that which came out of Adam could be the wife to Adam. Every part and every aspect of Eve was something of Adam. This confirms that the church can be built up only with that which is out of Christ. Doctrines and gifts do not build up the church. Christ Himself in the saints is the only material with which the Body of Christ can be built up. If we lack the experience of practically living by Christ, we will be only a certain kind of &ldquo;religious church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must learn to experience Christ not only as our life but also as our food, as the bread of life. He is the food supply within us. Day by day we need to feed on Christ and be nourished by Him. This must not be merely a teaching to us; it must be our daily and hourly experience. In John 6:57 the Lord says that he who eats Him will live because of Him. In order to live by Christ, we must eat Him; then He will be real to us. It is sad that many Christians are not eating Christ daily.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate in this way. A newborn child normally weighs between six and eight pounds. After he is full grown, he will weigh more than one hundred pounds. His body has been built up, but please tell me, by what means? He certainly was not built up by going to restaurants and looking at menus. His body was built up by the things he ate&mdash;by many eggs, chickens, potatoes, apples, bananas, and so forth. How, then, can the Body of Christ be built up? It cannot be built up by teaching, for the more we are taught how to eat, the more we will be reduced. In fact, if we learn only the art of eating, we will soon need a funeral. We may learn many things and even be the best dietitian, but we will soon die if we do not eat. In the spiritual realm, we may know all the good, scriptural, and even spiritual teachings and yet be starving from the lack of food. The churches today need &ldquo;mothers&rdquo; to nurse the young ones and give them not teachings but something of Christ to eat and drink (1 Thes. 2:7).</p>
<p>If you ask me what is troubling me these days, I will tell you that there are only two things. One is that although so many dear brothers and sisters have truly seen the negative things of Christianity and have seen something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way with His church, I am afraid that they will practice the church life by outward methods. Someone may say, &ldquo;Formerly I pastored a church in a certain way, but now I see that this way is wrong. Therefore, I will drop that way and use another way.&rdquo; This is still a religious activity, not the building up of the Body of Christ. The building up of the Body of Christ is something from within. To build up Christ&rsquo;s Body, we must feed on Christ, eat Christ, and drink Christ so that we will be nourished with Christ. When we are full of Christ, we will minister something of Christ as food to others. Then the Body of Christ will be built up.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of method. If we read the entire New Testament, we will discover one method. If I have any method at all, it is this: first, we must be put on the cross; second, we must feed on Christ in the spirit day by day; and third, when we are nourished and full of Christ, we need to nourish others with Christ. Then the church will come into being. The only method is to go to the cross, feed on Christ, and nourish others with Christ.</p>
<p>The other thing that troubles me is this: Though we have been speaking much concerning Christ as our life, I fear that we know this only as a message, as a term, as a subject; we do not have the daily and hourly experience of this. We need to be continually regulated and anointed by Christ. Daily and hourly we must feed on Him and have intimate fellowship with Him. We need to forget about ourselves and contact Him, enjoy Him, be regulated by Him, and be anointed by Him all the time. This is the inner life, the inward experience of the indwelling Christ. I would recommend to you a book written by Andrew Murray entitled <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> This book will be a great help to you, not to gain knowledge but to experience the indwelling Christ in your daily life. As you allow Christ to be your daily food, you will be able to testify to the whole universe, &ldquo;I am tasting Christ day by day. I am experiencing an intimate, living fellowship with Him hour by hour. I am under His regulating and His anointing all the time.&rdquo; We all need to pay full attention to this matter. This is the mark of God&rsquo;s economy. If we miss this mark of God&rsquo;s economy in our spirit, how can God&rsquo;s economy be worked out in the church? When we drive our car, we know where to put the gasoline and how to start the car; that is the mark of operating a car. If we lose that mark, although we may have a very beautiful car, it will not run.</p>
<p>This is the reason that the book of Hebrews includes a verse like 4:12: &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; The word of God is so living and penetrating that it divides our spirit from our soul. All the experiences taught in the book of Hebrews must be realized by discerning the spirit. The all-inclusive Christ as the good land is in our spirit, and His dwelling in the Holy of Holies also is in our spirit. If we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we will miss the mark and will be unable to enjoy Christ. Every day we must deal with the living Christ, who is subjective to us. Christ is within us, and He is living, real, and practical. When we eat Him, drink Him, and feast on Him as our daily nourishment, we will live by Him and with Him and be under His constant regulating and anointing. This is what we need to experience all the time if we would impart Christ as food to others. If people are fed with Christ, He will become the material in them, and the Body of Christ will gradually grow and be built up (Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:16). I do look to the Lord that our eyes will be opened to see the heavenly vision and the inner revelation of this living, indwelling, subjective Christ in our spirit as the mark of God&rsquo;s economy.</p></body></html>
