   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Having Lost the Sense of Morality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lot's daughters had lost their sense of morality, having been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they had had any sense of morality, they never would have considered lying with their father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first daughter laid with her father without any sense of shame and encouraged her sister to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They talked peacefully with one another about this without any feeling of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they were all in Sodom, Lot even proposed sacrificing his daughters to satisfy the Sodomites who were indulging in their sodomitical lust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could a man with a proper sense of spiritual morality have proposed such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should have said, "Let them kill me and my guests, but I will never do this to my virgin daughters."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where was Lot's sense of morality?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lot had been drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The result was that his daughters had no sense of morality and that their humanity was degraded to the lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some free groups today have also been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world and only care for success, not for the means.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They need the de-drugging of God's sobering word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 Desiring to Have the Seed Regardless of the Means</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lot's drugged daughters were desirous of having seed regardless of the means 19:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They cared only for the goal, not for the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christian groups are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They say, "What is wrong with preaching the gospel in this way as long as we bring people to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have won a great many people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How many souls have you won?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They care for soul-winning, but they do not care for the proper way of doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 Having Committed Incest</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lot's daughters committed incest, breaking the governing principle ordained by God 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we need to refer to Matthew 7:21-23.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said that when He comes back, some so-called Christian workers will say, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matt 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they had not done these things, they would be unable to talk like this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord will not deny that they did such works.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Matthew 7:23 the Lord said that He will "declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the Lord to say, "I never knew you" means "I never approved of you because you are a worker of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The runners in a race must stay in their lane.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However fast they run, they are not permitted to run lawlessly outside the boundaries of their lane.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, we need a governing principle for our spiritual activity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a matter of prophesying, casting out demons, or working miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a matter of the Father's will Matt 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spiritual activities must be the doing of the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our preaching, loving one another, and all we do must be the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we lack the assurance deep in our spirit that what we are doing is the Father's will, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do things without this assurance, we shall break the governing principle and commit spiritual incest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is lawlessness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord will never approve of such lawless workers.</S>
