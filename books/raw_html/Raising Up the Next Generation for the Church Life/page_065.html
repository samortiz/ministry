        <h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>We expect the children&rsquo;s work among us to be very prevailing. Therefore, we need to have a proper realization and preparation for this work. When we speak of the children&rsquo;s work, we are referring to children who have not graduated from elementary school but are more than five years old. These are the target of our children&rsquo;s work. If we are unable to take care of the children who are younger than this age group, we will leave them to the care of their parents. In order to give a message to young people or college students, we know that we must be well prepared. Some may think that it is easy to care for the children who are between the ages of five and twelve by simply giving them a piece of candy. However, to handle the children in this way will not yield a good result. According to my observation, the most difficult work to do effectively is the children&rsquo;s work. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 311)</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING THE HOMES FOR CHILDREN&rsquo;S MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The saints should open their homes for children&rsquo;s meetings. When the children&rsquo;s work is carried out in a good way, I estimate that there will be about three hundred groups with twenty-five to thirty children in a group. This is close to ten thousand children. This means that we will need several hundred places for the children&rsquo;s meetings. Of course, we can use the meeting halls, but the number of meeting halls we have will not meet this need. We need many brothers and sisters to open their homes. It would be good to have three hundred meeting places for the children every Lord&rsquo;s Day. How beautiful this service will be! And how much the Lord&rsquo;s work will be propagated! (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 305-306)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH<br />
ENDEAVORING IN THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Whether or not we succeed in the children&rsquo;s work depends partly on the teaching material and partly on the brothers and sisters who take the lead. The responsible brothers and the co-workers in every place must see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work in God&rsquo;s family. How can a family not take care of its children? This should be a great matter to us. No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them. Hence, we must serve the many children in God&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>From this time onward, the co-workers should give more thought to the way they lead people to know the Lord. They must pay attention to the sisters and the children. The co-workers should not say that they are not gifted for these two aspects of the work and therefore cannot do the work. If they cannot do it, they must learn how to do it; they should always learn. The co-workers do not need to be personally involved in doing the children&rsquo;s work. They can meet with the leading sisters in a locality and entrust the burden for the children&rsquo;s work to them, and they can encourage them. They must lead the church to receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work. The church should concentrate its effort on this work. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 314)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>The first matter for the sisters&rsquo; service is the children&rsquo;s work. Concerning the children&rsquo;s work, within me there is truly a heavy burden. All the churches must have a children&rsquo;s work. According to statistics, forty-five percent of the population of Taiwan is under fifteen years of age. This is roughly six million people. Many local churches have quite a few families with children. I estimate that there are about ten thousand children in the church in Taipei and about the same number of children in the churches in the rest of Taiwan. If we work with these twenty thousand children, they will all be young brothers and sisters after six to seven years. This is what the sisters should do.</p>
<p>In the past the church in Taipei did not pay adequate attention to this. Of the ten thousand children in Taipei, only about five hundred come to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; eight to nine thousand children are without any care. In spite of all the effort we use to preach the gospel in Taipei, we may not be able to bring three or even two thousand people to salvation in a year. If we cultivate our ten thousand children, they will all become young brothers and sisters in six or seven years. This means that we will have an average increase of a thousand people every year. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 304-305)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We cannot continue to work as we have in the past; we must change our ways. In the past we neglected the work with the children, the young people, and the sisters. We highly regarded a general work, but we paid little attention to the young people&rsquo;s work, and we merely prayed for the children&rsquo;s work. Now we must concentrate our efforts on the children, the young people, and the sisters. Moreover, the messages we give must minister Christ as the Spirit in a simple and direct way. We should focus on these primary matters and nothing else. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 270)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>The leading sisters in the churches must receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work. Under the arrangement of the church and the leading of the elders, they should concentrate on the children&rsquo;s work and lead all the sisters to participate. The elders are too busy to take care of the details. Instead of waiting for the elders, the sisters should pray much and make plans. They can then present their plans for the children&rsquo;s work to the elders for their approval. This is just like a family in which the husband is busy with his job and cannot plan the details for the household. The wife can make plans and carry things out with the consent of the husband. In this way the wife does not do anything independently and will still be able to take care of the details of the household in a timely way. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 314)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
