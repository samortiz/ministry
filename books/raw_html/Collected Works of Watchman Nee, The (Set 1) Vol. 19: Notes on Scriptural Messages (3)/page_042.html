<P>Christ is now waiting for His kingdom to come. He is also calling His believers to wait with Him and endure with Him. While we are on earth, we should renounce all our legal rights and endure men's despising and opposition. The position of a Christian in the world should be the same as the position Christ took when He was on earth. This is to keep the word of the endurance of Christ. The Lord will keep such persons out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.</P><P>Those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation say that keeping does not refer to the rapture but to a deliverance from the tribulation only; it is merely a preservation from falling away. For example, if this house is on fire today, and the kitchen is preserved while the rest of the house is burned to ashes, one can only say that God has provided a place in the house that keeps a person from the fire while the rest of the house is burning; God has not kept him away from the house. These ones say that to be kept from the hour of trial means to be preserved by God in the midst of the great tribulation; it does not mean to be taken away from the tribulation.</P><P>We have to notice that the Greek text here does not mean that one is preserved in the midst of the tribulation, but that one is kept away from the tribulation. It is like the word church, which means to be called out, and those in the church are the called-out ones. The original meaning of the expression "keep you out of the hour of trial" means to be brought out. It means literally to be delivered from. It is not to be preserved in the midst of the tribulation but to be brought out so that one does not have to go through the tribulation.</P><P>According to the direct translation of this verse, is the Lord Jesus promising the church in Philadelphia that they would be kept from the trial or from the hour of trial? It is not from the trial but from the hour of trial. For example, last year on January 28 there was war in Shanghai. This was like the tribulation. At that time some of our brothers were living in Jia-pei. Although the bombers, bombs, and tracers all flew over them, thank the Lord, they were preserved. This means that God had saved them from the trial. Some other brothers who were also living in Jia-pei moved away the first day the fighting started on January 28 to Southeast Asia. They were delivered from the danger of that day. In this case God had saved them from the hour of trial. There is a great difference between being kept from the trial and being kept from the hour of trial. Those who are kept from the trial need not leave the place of trial; they only need to be kept from the trial. But those who are kept from the hour of trial are kept from seeing the trial at all; as such, they must be delivered completely from the scene of the trial. Since such ones are delivered from the time of the trial, they must also be delivered from the place of the trial. A man can be preserved in the midst of the trial, but he can never be kept from the hour of the trial and still go through the trial.</P><P>Some have said that to be preserved from the trial is like the Israelites in the land of Goshen in Egypt; when God punished the Egyptians, the Israelites were preserved by God. But the Bible (Rev. 3:10) says that they will not even see that hour. If the Bible only says that they are kept from the trial, there will still be the possibility for them to go through the tribulation; they can still pass through the tribulation and be preserved by God in the midst of it. But the Bible says that they are kept from the hour of trial. They will not even meet the hour. How then can they pass through the tribulation? Therefore, our friends' argument cannot stand that being kept means to be preserved from falling and being hurt.</P><P>How can one be kept from the hour of trial? There are only two ways: one is by death and the other is by being raptured. Once a man dies, the tribulation will not come to him. Once a man is raptured, the tribulation also will not come to him. Which kind of preserving is the one spoken of here? It is the rapture. If a believer is living today, is God going to preserve him by sending him to death? He will not. Although Revelation 3:10 does not mention the rapture explicitly, nevertheless, it clearly hints at the rapture. From this verse we can see that the rapture does not all take place before the tribulation nor all after the tribulation. Those who keep the word of Christ's endurance will be kept by the Lord from the hour of trial. The Lord has opened up such a way for us.</P><P>The believers' condition on earth today should not be different from that of Christ in heaven today. This is the time of Christ's endurance, and believers should endure the same on earth today as Christ endured when He was on the earth. If they do this, they are qualified to be raptured.</P>
