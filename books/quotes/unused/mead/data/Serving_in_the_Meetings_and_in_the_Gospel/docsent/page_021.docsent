   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Way of the Result of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second way to catch people is according to the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would advise you not to use this way very much, but with some persons we must use this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It always depends on what kind of person we are talking with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a person is conscious of his sins and is more or less afraid of the result, we should take advantage of this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may compare this to fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not attack the stronghold; rather, we should find and attack the weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we contact people, it is easy to find their weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person is afraid of death or has a consideration about the future, this is his weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are two kinds of suffering as the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One is the suffering in the present age, which we can illustrate to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the present age, one who sins in dancing, drinking, and gambling will suffer physically, financially, and in other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A gambler, for instance, will suffer in his health, have a loss in his business, and damage his family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, one who drinks too much will shorten his life on the earth; he will die too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The other kind of suffering as a result of sin is from the judgment and punishment after death, which we can show from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again, we need to know the best verses of the Scriptures for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Way of the Vanity of Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third way to deal with people is according to the vanity of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is almost the best way to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Especially today people have the sense that human life is empty, nothing but a vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we find that this is a person s weak point, we must take advantage and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to point out that they sense the emptiness in human life because they do not have God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they have Christ, they have God, and their life will be full and their sense of vanity will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, they are short of Christ, so there is a gap in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best verses to use for this purpose are from Ecclesiastes, which speaks of vanity of vanities Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Way of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fourth way to catch people is according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people on the earth have a problem and question concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They ask, Is there a God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What have I to do with God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we talk with a person, we should sense whether he is one who has this sense about God, whether he fears God or desires to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this, again we should know the best verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Way of the Love of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fifth way is according to the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should take this way with persons experiencing trouble, sickness, loss, and sufferings, persons who are disappointed, suppressed, and oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to show such persons that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is one of the best ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very easy to use this way to win people, but we must use it with the right people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not take this way with people who are rich and well off in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is when people are suffering that they need the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times God prepares people s hearts by allowing them to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When people suffer, it is easy for them to be won by the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Way of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sixth way is the highest way, the way of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, this way is not easy to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is hard to preach the gospel with the subject of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the highest standard for the gospel, but some people need this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The people of high class and standard, the highly cultured and educated people, have a certain philosophy of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we talk with them about God or sin, they will not care.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should talk to them according to the Scriptures about Christ as the center of the universe, the central element of all things, the goal of God s plan, and the need of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this message we do not have the adequate time to speak about this subject in detail; we need an entire morning and evening for six months to study this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not speak about sin, hell, or heaven to this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can never convince such a person in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have met some professors who told me in principle, We are not so selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not care about hell.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We want something high.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I learned from them, and I changed my way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The subject of Christ is their weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should simply speak about Christ as the goal, the aim, the standard, the center, the element, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should point out to them the highest standard and ultimate goal of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we should give them the right passages of the Scriptures and the right illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have done this, and many people have been saved in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we take this way, this kind of person will be won over.</S>
