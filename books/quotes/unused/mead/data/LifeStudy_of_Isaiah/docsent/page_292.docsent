   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message we want to see the all-inclusive Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, He is the Anointed of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a very precious term in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, He is the Angel of the presence of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may think that to say "the Angel of the presence of Jehovah" is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may prefer to say "the Angel in the presence of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the text of the Scripture says "the Angel of His presence" Isa 63:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The most striking chapter on the Angel of Jehovah is Exodus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Angel of Jehovah was the One who escorted the entire race of Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness and into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually this One, the Angel of Jehovah, is in Zechariah 1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the One who rides on the red horse, who was suffering with God's suffering people in order to serve them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Angel of Jehovah served the children of Israel in their whole journey of forty years in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Exodus 14 we can see that He was taking the lead at the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Egyptian army was chasing after Israel, the Angel turned to the rear v. 19 . He Himself protected Israel from the Egyptian army.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That Angel of Jehovah was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The last item of the all-inclusive Christ in the book of Isaiah is the Angel of, not in, the presence of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His being the Angel of the presence of Jehovah means that He is the presence of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of indicates apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I am with you, that means you and I are two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I am of you, this makes us one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A husband may say that he is of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That means that he and his wife are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the presence implies two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of the presence means one person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Angel of Jehovah is just Jehovah's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I say, "the life in Christ," this means the life and Christ are two.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I say, "the life of Christ," this means the life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Angel of the presence of Jehovah means that this very Angel is the presence of Jehovah.</S>
