   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUB-SECTION FIVE SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REFORMED CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>3:1-6 VERSE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 1:"And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to remember that these last four churches are special.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although historically they come one after the other, all of them will remain until the Lord comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are not like the first three churches, which follow consecutively one after the other and replace one another, Smyrna replacing Ephesus and Pergamos replacing Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here, Sardis does not replace Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is only produced after Thyatira, and it will exist together with Thyatira until the Lord comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must remember this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we know that Sardis comes after Thyatira and will exist simultaneously with Thyatira, it will not be difficult for us to discover which period of the church Sardis refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, Sardis must represent the Protestant church, or the Reformed church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the word "Sardis" in the original language has the meaning of "recovery," we have to be careful not to take Sardis as the church during the time of Luther's Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we know that Sardis refers to the Protestant church, we must find out which part of the long history of Protestantism Sardis refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to this letter, the situation of the church described here does not seem to be that at the time of the Reformation, but after the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The testimony Luther and his co-workers bore in their homeland and elsewhere was a direct work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can say that it was the Reformation of the Holy Spirit and not the Reformation of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What the Lord described in this letter was not the condition of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reformation is God's own work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not judging the Reformation itself for He cannot judge His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here, what the Lord held the church responsible for was its condition after the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Luther, the Jezebelian church was very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Other than a few who lamented for the sin of the day in private, almost no one rejected the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's children had completely joined themselves with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It became a strange thing not to eat the idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than God's remnant, no one seemed to know how to depart from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was in this circumstance that God chose and prepared Luther to be His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God honored Luther and gave him the privilege to call God's children back to the Bible, to realize that they were justified by faith and that they should listen to God's own words rather than man's words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under such circumstances, a ray of light seemed to have pierced through the dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God was now pouring the living water out of the heavens on high and nourishing dried-up lives, providing them the strength to break away from the bondage of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thousands of people began to join the great movement of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this situation did not last for long!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, no one can doubt the work of the Holy Spirit in the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after the Reformation, we saw a gradual decline in the zeal for the Word and God's wonderful blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That which was once God's work had now become a cold fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Protestantism had become a great force.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When man tries to exploit this force, the power of the Holy Spirit is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the end, Protestantism becomes nothing but a protest against Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The light and truth that it has received become nothing more than weapons against the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sardis does not represent the Reformation that was full of the power of the Holy Spirit, but the Protestantism that is void of power and life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is gradually corrupted, all the way to the end.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to realize that this letter of the Lord to the church in Sardis was a most solemn one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This letter was sent to a nominal church and covered the responsibility of this nominal church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Lord's view, and in considering the name, nature, and responsibility of this nominal church, this letter should arouse every saint to a heart of solemnity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While it is true that we are presently dealing very much with the traditions of Thyatira, that is, Roman Catholicism, we do not have much of a direct relationship with the church in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What our eyes see and our ears hear presently are mostly things related to Sardis, the reformed church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we know the tremendous responsibility Sardis takes and the dangerous position Sardis has, we will be taught some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although the Lord's letter to Sardis was so solemn, the beginning of this letter gives us the greatest comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The greater the responsibility, the greater the comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although everything can fail, the Lord Christ is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He can meet the need of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was in this circumstance that the Lord unveiled His never-changing riches to show the church that His name is full of what we lack.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said that He is the One "who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here the Lord mentions His own power and the fact that all those responsible for bearing the light belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only He has the right to direct them and to demand submission from them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this book, the Holy Spirit reveals to us the various aspects of His works.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As such He is called the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is related to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is unlike the oneness found in His relationship with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In chapter one, we see a distinction between the seven Spirits and Christ; we see Him as being before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In chapter four, we see Him as "seven lamps of fire burning before the throne" v. 5 . The throne signifies God's supreme authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It also signifies the glory and honor that God is about to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The seven lamps before the throne speak of the power of the Holy Spirit in shedding forth light to judge sin and to accomplish what the throne decrees.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The accomplishment of this matter is based on the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is given in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There we see the Lord Jesus Christ as the Lamb, and the seven Spirits are the "seven eyes" of the Lamb sent to all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not talking about the work of the Holy Spirit in the church; rather, it is about the different ways the Holy Spirit works and His different attributes for the execution of God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here, the Holy Spirit is manifesting His own power for the fulfillment and accomplishment of God's purpose on earth.</S>
