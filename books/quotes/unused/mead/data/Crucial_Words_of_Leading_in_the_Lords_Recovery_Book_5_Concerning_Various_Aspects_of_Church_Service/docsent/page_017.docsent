   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPREADING THE BENEFIT OF THE LORD S RECOVERY TO THE ENTIRE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These examples show that what we are cultivated in influences the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we planted spread from mainland China to Taiwan and even overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This proves that all the situations in the world today are to facilitate the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This also shows that the seed of the gospel that we plant, the truth that we release, and the divine life that we supply are of manifold value.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The benefit they bring will spread to the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was saved as a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, a young woman came to my town and held a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I went to listen to her out of curiosity, and the Lord gained me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As I was walking home, the Lord called me, and I said, O Lord, even if You give me the whole world, I do not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I want to take my Bible and preach the gospel in village after village.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if I must eat tree roots and drink water from streams, I desire to preach Your gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the summer of that year I went to the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was still a student, but I resolved that this would be my work for the rest of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was a small dream that I had for the countryside of Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Little did I know that the Lord would take me to country after country.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, the gospel and life have spread from here to millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this we worship the Lord from the depths of our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We rejoice that so many young people have consecrated themselves to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They must be faithful and loyal to bring in the unlimited blessing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are around two hundred full-timers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not know when the Lord will return, but there is a great need before us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only do the unbelievers need the gospel; if we open our eyes, we will see that Christianity is desolate and in need of the gospel, the truth, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1949 I began the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I came to Taiwan with virtually nothing and a household of twelve people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We lived in a house that was less than three hundred square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I wrote the first publication on a coffee table.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I came to Taiwan, I had only enough money to cover my family expenses for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before 1949 there were less than twenty churches overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, thirty-five years later, there are more than six hundred churches in the Lord s recovery on all five continents, and this does not include those in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, the literature work has also spread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two main stations in America: one is in Anaheim, California, and the other is in Irving, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Taipei we have the Gospel Book Room with at least fifty to sixty full-time brothers and sisters serving in three departments.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The literature work began in the less than three-hundred-square-foot house where I used to live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LABORING WITH A GOAL AND CARING FOR THE BASICS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to labor in the Lord s work solidly and care for the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should always begin small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The young serving ones need to understand two points.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, if you have a desire and are willing to receive a burden for the gospel, the truth, life, and the church, the Lord will bless you and use you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, you should always remember not to aim high in your work and not to neglect the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should not do a work that is a display, having no substance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our work must be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It should begin small and gradually extend to a larger scale.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the first day until now, this work has not been thwarted by frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A work that is all show with no substance cannot withstand frustrations, but a work that begins small cannot be thwarted by any frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It will grow step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if there are some frustrations, they will only bring in valuable experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, when the young full-timers labor on the campuses, if there is an opportunity to do something big, you should not do it, because you are not able to bear up a big work, and your foundation and roots are not firm.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should begin on a small scale and work step by step, never attempting to make a show.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While you are still young, you should learn to plant your feet on solid ground, care for the basics, and not aim high.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must begin in a solid way from the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should preach nothing but the truth, the gospel, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you take the way of caring for the basics and move forward in a stable way, you will surely bring in the Lord s blessings.</S>
