   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE 3 Scripture Reading: John 3:1-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of this message I would call your attention to John 3:16, a very familiar verse to us all: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Please notice that this verse begins with the little word "for."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered "for" here, gar, is often used in a very significant way, especially in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul's Epistles show that he was a very logical and reasonable person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often he uses the word "for" to explain his thought.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, in Romans 8:1-27, twelve verses begin with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The use of the word "for" at the beginning of John 3:16 indicates that this is not an isolated verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, this is a verse that depends upon the foregoing word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Based upon what is covered in 3:1-15, verse 16 explains, "For God so loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>" GRACE AND GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before considering this matter further, I would like to speak concerning grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace refers to a gift, to something given free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you were to give someone a free gift, that gift may be regarded as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word for grace, charis, may be rendered either grace or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A gift is always a grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the common understanding among Christians, grace denotes unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gospel of John uses the word grace in a very emphatic way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in 1:16 and 17 John goes on to say, "For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The law is lifeless; hence, it was given.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Grace, however, is a person; hence, we are told that grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Students of the Bible know that the law is a great matter, but grace is an even greater matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may say that the Bible teaches two main things: the law of the old dispensation and the grace of the new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No other book in the New Testament emphasizes grace in the way the Gospel of John does.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would know what grace is, we need to come to this Gospel, a Gospel that emphasizes grace to the uttermost, and inquire of the Apostle John what he means by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter three of John we have a definition of grace, even though the word grace is not used in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not told here that God gave us some kind of unmerited favor; we are told that He gave us a Person, His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Person whom God gave is the gift, and this gift is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 3 we have a link that connects this chapter with John 1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter one of John we have grace, and in chapter three we have God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Grace is the giving, and this giving is grace.</S>
