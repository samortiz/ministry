   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST HAVING THE FIRST PLACE IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth main point in Colossians is that Christ has the first place, the preeminence, in all things 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That Christ would be the first in everything is according to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CHRIST OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fifth main point is that Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 1:12 says, "Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the allotted portion given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Strictly speaking, God has given only Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All other things are simply shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt God gives us food, sunshine, air, breath, and many good things, but all these things are merely shadows of Christ; the reality is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the entire universe what else is our portion?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not have Christ, we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we do have the shadows, they are vanity, because it is easy for shadows to depart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if we had a palace, in only one night it could burn up in a fire or be brought down by an earthquake.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything soon fades away because it is all a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only Christ is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only He exists forever without change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the present time I am almost sixty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can say from my heart that I love nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only Him do I love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All night and all day I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing is so dear to me as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the past half century from my teenage years to the present time, I have noticed all the changes in international and national affairs, in families, and in society.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything is a shadow that passes away quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this I have learned that nothing on earth is lovable or trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only One is so dear to me, and He is so real to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In nothing or no one else can I put my trust; I can trust only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the reality, and He is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not have Christ, you are a person of vanity, but if you have Christ, you are a person of reality; you have Him, and He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that we all would learn to realize Him and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply love Him, and do not seek anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything else is merely a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, while we are still on this earth, we need many things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we must use these things in the way of realizing Christ as our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only portion which God gives to us is this wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to know Him, to live Him, to take Him, to experience Him, and to realize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not a religion, a doctrine, a set of teachings, or even Christianity, but an all-inclusive, real, and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is worthwhile for us to have Him, and we can never regret having Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since my youth, for more than forty years, I have loved Him without any regret.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the portion of the saints in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHRIST OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sixth, this very Christ is life to us 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is very intimate, tender, subjective, and near.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nothing is as dear, precious, and available to us as our life, yet even our own life, the very life we received from our parents, is not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is only a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, he who does not have Christ does not have the life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is not only our portion for us to enjoy, but He is our life for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though I have been teaching and ministering for more than thirty years, I still do not have the adequate words to explain what it means that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is something beyond human expression and human utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can simply say that this wonderful Christ today is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How precious and how wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is everything, He is our portion, and even more He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In all the sixty-six books of the Bible, Colossians 3:4 is the clearest word about Christ being our life.</S>
