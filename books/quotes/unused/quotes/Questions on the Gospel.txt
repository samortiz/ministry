The book is composed of fifty questions and answers related to the basic truths concerning salvation, justification, law, and grace, etc
Romans 4:4 says, 'Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due'
Freely in the original text is the same word as 'without a cause' in John 15:25, where the Lord said, 'They hated Me without cause'
If thirty percent of man's salvation was by works, man could boast of that thirty percent, while God would lose thirty percent of the glory
If ten percent of man's salvation was by works, man could boast of that ten percent, while God would lose ten percent of the glory
The questions of whether or not God should give and whether man is worthy cannot be placed side by side with grace
When the Lord said, 'If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor' , the young man was not able
Man cannot rely on his own merit before God; it would overthrow the Lord's work, as though He had died in vain
God does not withhold His grace because of man's unworthiness; instead, He bestows grace because of his unworthiness
The bestowing of grace is neither according to a person's condition nor the result of comparing one person to another
In the parable of the shepherd seeking the lost sheep, the shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep to seek the one lost sheep
Whether you are a great sinner or a small sinner, as long as you are a lost sheep, you need the Lord Jesus to die for you
A debt means that you have been loaned a sum of money, which allows you to enjoy it for the present, but that you will later pay it back
Grace is neither the giving of wages according to one's labor, nor a temporary borrowing of something which one has to repay
Men have a wrong concept: we think that salvation is by grace, but that maintaining our salvation depends upon our own selves
Having good works and serving the Lord faithfully are neither for obtaining salvation nor for maintaining salvation
Rather, God devised and worked out a solution to the problem of our sins, affording us the opportunity to be saved
If we misunderstand God's grace and consider it merely as God's generosity, the cross of Christ would be unnecessary and totally meaningless
Since we have no way to settle this sin, He caused His Son to bear our sins on the cross and solved the problem of sin once for all
A sinner is reckoned as a sinner because: his conduct is bad; his nature is corrupted; and God's righteous law has judged him
In saving a sinner God must: forgive his sins, that is, his bad conduct; regenerate him by giving him a new life; and justify him
From these verses we can see that iniquity is the condition of man before God after committing transgression and sin
Exodus and Leviticus frequently mention the things the priests had to do in the Holy Place in order to bear man's sin
Consequently, when Daniel 9:24 speaks of transgression and sins, it says, 'To close the transgression, and to make an end of sins'
Proverbs 28:24 says, 'Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer'
Micah 1:5 says, 'All this is because of the transgression of Jacob/And because of the sins of the house of Israel
Thank God, the problem of our transgressions and iniquity has been solved through the redemptive work of Christ
The word blessed in verse 7 refers to a negative aspect; whereas the word blessed in verse 8 is speaking of a positive aspect
Hebrews 9:26 says clearly that the Lord was manifested once at the consummation of the ages to offer Himself as a sacrifice to put away sin
For 'He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant '
Let us first remember that 'redemption' or 'atonement' in the Old Testament means 'to cover up' in the original language
Hebrews 9:12 says, 'But through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption'
Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself'
Hebrews 10:10 and 12 says, 'By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
In those sacrifices there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
Red typifies sins because it says in Isaiah 1:18, 'Though your sins are like scarlet though they are as red as crimson'
When the Lord bore our sins on the cross, the work was absolute and unlimited, and nothing else can be added to it
Only when you come before God with the blood can He forgive you, for without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins
Although God is merciful and willing to be gracious and although it is His will to willingly forgive us He cannot forgive without the blood
If they were also forgiven, there would be chaos because murderers could be freed simply by pleading for mercy
In Matthew 8:1-4, when the Lord Jesus healed the leper, He also commanded him to offer the gift that Moses charged
We dare to draw near to God because of the effectiveness of the blood which the Lord Jesus shed, not because of ourselves
Let us list all the occurrences of the word sin , in both its singular and plural forms, that are found in the New Testament
39 20 48 512 13 20 21 61 2 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 20 22 23 77 8 9 11 13 14 17 20 23 25 82 3 10 1423 1 Cor
After reading the many Scripture verses above we will see how wise God was in the writing of the Bible and we will truly say to Him O God!
The singular form, sin, in the Bible never refers to the outward sin, but it does have two different kinds of usage
All 'confession of sin' in the Bible should be 'confession of sins,' the plural number and not the singular number
When the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, 'You will die in your sins' , He was saying that they would die in their sins and not in sin
Since the blood of the Lord Jesus has obtained for us the forgiveness of these sins, our conscience is no longer conscious of sins
For if the blood washed sin it would mean that we would never again feel the power of sin which is the power that drives us to commit sins
We are no longer slaves to sin, because the old man that directly instigated the body to commit sins has been crucified
The sins mentioned here is plural, referring to the removal of punishment for sins and not to the purging of the root of sin
If so, then not only would the root of sin in the believers be eradicated, but even the root of sin in the whole world would be eradicated
The preceding part shows that if we walk in the light as God is in the light, we will have fellowship one with another
If this cleansing referred to our sinful nature, and we walked in the light as God is in the light, we would have no sin
We can see that sin refers to the sin that dominates within us as master, while sins refer to our outward conduct
If the Lord Jesus had become sins, then He too would have had sins in His conduct and would have been a sinner
In the second section, except for the one instance in chapter seven where sins is mentioned, all the references are to sin
The second section says that God not only forgives us of our sins , but He also frees us from the sin that dominates us
God not only forgives our sins and does not punish us anymore; He also saves us from sin and from committing sins
Because your sins had been forgiven, you were able to stand in God's grace, rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God
After becoming a Christian, not only do you feel the evil of outward sins, but you also feel inward sin lording it over you
If the blood were all that God required, God could have used a different way to cause the Lord Jesus to shed His blood
In this way, although sin is still alive, it cannot seduce one who is already dead, for a dead person is freed from sin
Once a man has died, sin cannot interfere with him any longer, because even though sin is alive, the person is dead
Does it say, 'If we confess our sins, He is merciful and loving to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'?
With the blood on the propitiation place, the law cannot condemn man's sin, because the requirements of the law have been fulfilled
When he returns the one hundred dollars, you should return the promissory note to him in order to cancel the debt
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
The same is true with being in Christ; when Christ died, we also died, and when Christ resurrected, life flowed into us
Peter 3 says that the Lord Jesus Himself is righteous; He is qualified to be a substitute for us who are unrighteous
He has given the same precious faith to all, to those believers who have come first or come last, and to both the Jews and the Gentiles
But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
The righteousness of Christ refers to the goodness of Christ, whereas Christ becoming righteousness refers to Christ Himself
The meal offering contains no blood because it signifies the living, good conduct, and virtue of the life of the Lord Jesus
The sin offering is offered as the propitiation for the sin of our entire life, and the trespass offering is offered for our daily sins
The Lord Jesus' persecution expresses the love of God, and His being put to death expresses the righteousness of God
If the earthly life of the Lord Jesus had expressed only righteousness, there would not have been so much opposition
He said, 'Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me' because He was afraid that some would be stumbled because of His abundant grace
There were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian'
He first loves us and then works so that we can believe and receive the redemption He has accomplished on the cross
If Christ is a third party, then God is unrighteous toward Him because He has no sin and does not deserve to die
These verses say that when we have sinned against God, not only is an offering of rams of no avail, all the sacrifices are of no value
Why does Romans 5:18 say, 'One offense one righteous act,' yet verse 19 says, 'The disobedience of one man the obedience of the One'?
Paul, therefore, put in a parenthetical explanation, verses 13 to 17, which may be subdivided into three sections
Verses 13 through 14 say, 'For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account when there is no law
Paul's reasoning was that since Adam's sin caused the many to die, could not the grace of God be gained more by the many?
If one offense could affect so many, it is not known how many would be condemned by ten offenses or a hundred offenses
If you can say that all men were condemned in Adam, why can you not say that in Christ all men were justified to receive life?
Putting it in another way, the other act was inferior to this act because the former man was inferior to the latter Man
Verse 19 tells us that the reason the act of Adam was not as good as the act of Christ is that Adam was inferior to Christ
Verse 20 says, 'And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has superabounded'
What has saved us is Christ's death and the righteousness accomplished through His death, not the righteous acts of Christ
Paul says, 'Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin'
But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets'
To justify is not only to forgive a man or reckon him to be without sins but, even more, to pronounce him righteous
Paul was afraid someone might think that since man was justified through faith, the law would be abolished through faith
The law has only two requirements: the law commands man to do good, and the law punishes those who do not do good
Although we cannot establish the law by keeping it and deserve to die, praise and thank God that we have died in Christ!
The believers are not under the law because, on the one hand, they are already dead, and on the other hand, they are resurrected
Once we are clear about this point, we can conclude that 'the husband' in this section refers to the flesh and also to the law
On the other hand, the verse says, 'If the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband'
One picture is that through the body of Christ, we are dead to the law and have completely broken away from it
Not being under the law, but being under grace, means that the resurrected Christ is living in us and enabling us to overcome
When the people heard this, they might have thought that the blessings spoken by the Lord were absolutely different from the Old Testament
Contrary to what these two schools say, the meaning of 'fulfill,' was for the Lord to fill to the brim; it was to make up the lack
In Matthew 5:23 the Lord spoke concerning the matter of offering sacrifices on the altar, indicating that the Lord was not against the altar
After healing him the Lord commanded him to show his body to the priest and offer the gift which Moses had commanded
Although the Lord acknowledged that the law and the prophets came from God, He also said that the law was not complete
The Lord agreed with Moses when he said that it was right for one not to kill or commit adultery, but even this was not complete
The word 'fulfill' refers to the Lord's work of fulfilling as a teacher, not to His work of fulfilling as a Savior
If anyone says that the disciples refer to the Jews, there is at least one verse in the Bible that says that they are Christians
There is no verse in the Bible that says, 'the disciples are the Jews'; nor is there the term 'Jewish disciples'
When we preach the gospel, we also need to teach people to keep the Lord's teachings, which include the Lord's teaching on the mount
It is true that the teaching on the mount is difficult, but we cannot push all the difficult matters onto the Jews
The things that the Lord said include not only believing in the Lord Jesus and receiving eternal life, but also the Lord's commandments
The disciples were not only commissioned to preach the gospel; they were also commissioned to teach people to obey the Lord's teachings
One iota' refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and 'one serif' refers to the diacritical marks in the Hebrew alphabet
It is because the law only goes as far as the end of the millennial kingdom, while the prophets cover eternity
The Lord said that heaven and earth could pass away only when each iota and each serif of the law was fulfilled
Later, when others ask them about the matter of baptism, they make up a set of doctrines about not being baptized
On the other hand while the Lord was on the earth and before He died and resurrected He was the expression of the law and all the ceremonies
Regarding the law, we have to either keep all or none of it; we cannot take what we want and reject what we do not want
Some think that even though Christians do not have to keep the ceremonial laws, they still have to keep the moral laws
Verse 17 says, on the negative side, that the law is not to be abolished, and on the positive side that it has to be fulfilled
Verses 18 through 19 show us the Lord's attitude toward the law on the negative side: the law is not to be abolished
Verse 20 shows us the Lord's attitude toward the law on the positive side: the law is to be fulfilled, that is, filled to the brim
We can obtain eternal life in this age, but the kingdom of the heavens will only be established when the Lord comes again
Once we believe, we obtain eternal life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we have to pursue it daily
If we, the saved ones, want to reign at the Lord's second coming, we have to work out our own righteousness through the Holy Spirit
The Galatians thought that the promises came after the law; Paul proved that the promises were made before the law
Among Christians there is the mistaken concept that God had to save man by grace because He failed to achieve His purpose through the law
The reason God gave the law to the children of Israel was because they failed to realize the preciousness of grace
What Galatians 3:21 means is that if the law could have given life to man, it could also have given righteousness to man
Verse 21 says, 'So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'
When we believe in Him, we receive the righteousness attained by Him; then this righteousness becomes our life
Our salvation is based on the righteousness attained by Christ, which renders it impossible for God not to forgive us
The word redemption means to buy back, that is, a certain object that was once held as a pledge has now been bought back
They say that because we were slaves under the devil's hand, the Lord Jesus shed His blood and redeemed us out of his hand
If this is the case, does this not mean that God acknowledged that it was lawful for us to be in the devil's hand?
Galatians 3:13 says, 'Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf'
We were sinners before God under the curse of the law, but the Lord Jesus died for us and redeemed us from the curse of the law
Whoever violates the law has to be punished; by the shedding of His blood, the Lord Jesus answered the demands of the law
We were saved by the righteousness of God because the Lord Jesus died, and God must save us if we have believed
In the future there will only be voices of pain in hell but no voices of complaint, because hell is God's most righteous punishment
Since the basis of salvation is the death of Christ why does the Bible tell us to believe not only in His death but also in His resurrection
God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead in order to show them that 'it was not possible for Him to be held by it'
He was the One whom 'God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
Without the touch of the Holy Spirit, man is not able to believe that the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead
When Christ said, 'It is finished,' on the cross, it meant that redemption was finished; it did not mean that salvation was finished
If the Lord had only died without being resurrected, we would no longer be sinners, but we would still remain dead men
If we only preach Christ's death, without preaching His resurrection, we are preaching only one half of the gospel
In reading the book of Acts, we see that the apostles paid a great deal of attention to the Lord's resurrection
Without resurrection there can be no salvation, because we are regenerated by God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
Today gospel preachers have an inclination to put an adequate emphasis on Christ's death but not on Christ's resurrection
The world believes that the Lord Jesus has died; but it is not easy for them to believe that He died to bear our sins
When we tell someone that the Lord Jesus has died for his sins and if the Holy Spirit reveals the resurrected Christ to him he will believe
Not only does the Lord Jesus' resurrection prove that His death is for our sins, His resurrection also gives us a new life
Even though His death paid our old debts, we would still not have the strength to avoid new debts if the Lord Jesus had not resurrected
We not only have to believe that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins, but we also have to realize that He has resurrected and now lives in us
God has put a new life into us; this life is a resurrection life with no bounds, which will raise us in the same way Christ was raised
Many people make a basic mistake of receiving only the work of the Lord Jesus' death but not the work of His resurrection
Some Christians often feel that their circumstances are too difficult and their families have too many problems
We have clearly seen that death has solved the problem of sins, and resurrection has given us a new life that enables us not to sin
Just as the action of the one man, Adam, included all of mankind, the work of the one man, Christ, included all of mankind
The Bible reckons Abraham's offering of tithes and receiving of the blessings as Levi's offering of tithes and receiving of the blessings
Christ as the Son of Man has terminated everything of Adam, and Christ as the Son of God has begun the new creation
In the Old Testament, the most crucial miracle is the miracle of Jonah, which refers to the Lord Jesus' resurrection from the dead
God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah, and he remained in the belly of this fish three days and three nights
When God commanded the fish to vomit Jonah out upon the dry land, Jonah obeyed God's command to go to Nineveh and preach the gospel
Jonah had to be cast into the sea, the Lord Jesus had to die, and we too must die and partake of the Lord's death
After we believe in the Lord and have the experience of resurrection, we are willing to do what we previously were very unwilling to do
It is not to think less about ourselves because when we think less about ourselves, we are still thinking about ourselves
Justification, according to the Bible, has two meanings: A believer has been forgiven of his sins, and God sees him as righteous or perfect
When he comes before God, he is not only free from any defilement of sin, but he is also clothed with the robe of righteousness
We should, no doubt, rejoice in the forgiveness of sins, but God gives us more than just the forgiveness of sins in Christ
The thief who was saved at the time of his death was accepted by God as much as the apostles John, Peter, and Paul
The blood of the Lord is able to purify our conscience to the point that we no longer have a conscience burdened by sin
More than twenty years before, she had committed a most disgraceful sin, which lasted for a period of several months
Although she later repented, there was always condemnation within her that the sin she had committed could never be forgiven
The preacher said, 'Let us read together the last clause of that verse: 'The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin'
He then entrusted her to God with a few simple words, asking God to make her believe that her sins had already been forgiven and cleansed
Since many people have not seen this point clearly, they look daily at their sins instead of the sinner's Savior
On the objective side, we appear before God in Christ and have a new position so that God sees us just as He sees Christ
Many Christians do not grow because they are under the accusation of their conscience, and they have no freedom before God
Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God
When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him
During the first three hours, the Lord spoke three sentences, and during the last three hours, He spoke four sentences
In order to answer this, we must be clear that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to bear the sin of the world
The righteous God could forgive our sins only by the cross because 'without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness'
Many martyrs, who experience man's persecution and severe punishment, do not show any sign of sorrow or self-pity
If He was only crucified on the cross through the persecution of man, God should have been much nearer to Him!
After the Lord spoke the first three sentences, God heard the Lord Jesus' prayer and put all the sins of mankind upon Him
At that moment the Lord suffered the punishment of hell on man's behalf and tasted death for every man because He bore our sins
Here He was able to say, 'Father,' because after the redemptive work was accomplished, His fellowship with the Father was instantly restored
These passages show us that even when the Lord was on the earth, everyone who believed in Him could have eternal life
Although the work of redemption has already been accomplished, many Christians have not clearly comprehended it
Some think that if they are good in their behavior, they are qualified to go to heaven and able to go boldly and confidently
If a saved believer misbehaves, he is not disqualified from heaven, but he will not be able to enter the kingdom
We fall short of the glory of God because of sins; whereas we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God because of the blood
Christ preached the gospel only to the people who contacted Him directly, and His preaching was limited only to those in that generation
The meaning of Christ dying for our sins is that Christ died for the sins which we, the sinners, have committed
In God's redemption, Christians do not exchange their positions with Christ; rather, they are united to Christ
In God's redemption, if we said that Christ only stood in the position of the sinners in order to die for us, it would make God unrighteous
If redemption were only a matter of 'carrying,' then it could be accomplished by merely carrying something on the body
The Lord Jesus is united to us to such a degree that He not only bore or carried our sins, but He also was made sin
Because there was a union of God and man, the Lord Jesus was able to die for us, resurrect for us, and become the mighty Savior
If we are clear on this point, then the number of problems that we encounter in our daily life will be greatly reduced
When were we united with Christ on the objective side, and when were we united with Him on the subjective side?
We were united with Christ objectively at the time Christ died on the cross: 'One died for all, therefore all died'
By reading Romans 6:3-5 and 8, we can see one thing: our subjective union with Christ is altogether in His resurrection
Rather, we acknowledge that we have died in Christ, and we daily allow the resurrection life to be lived out through us
We must remember that the Bible only tells us the truth: 'We have died with Christ,' not 'Christ died with us'
Why does the Bible say that we are 'in the Lord,' 'in Christ,' and 'in Christ Jesus,' but never 'in Jesus' or 'in Jesus Christ'?
The Bible does not use the phrase in Jesus or in Jesus Christ because we are not united with the Lord in His living on the earth
For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ'
Although He is addressed with the title Jesus in Acts and in the Epistles several times, these are special references to His humanity
Was it between the time He was put on the cross and the time He expired, or was it at the very moment He expired?
If we understand question thirty-two, we can conclude that we were crucified with Christ at the moment He expired
If we were crucified with Him during that time we would have been participating in His redemption and thereby we would have become saviors
What is the difference between the significance and function of the blood and the significance and function of the cross?
Or could we change 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him' to 'Knowing this, that our old man shed blood with Him'?
If the significance and function of the blood are the same as that of the cross, then they are interchangeable
Perhaps some may ask, 'Does not 1 John 1:7 tell us that 'the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin''?
It does, but we must remember that whenever the Bible mentions cleansing from sins by the blood, it always refers to a cleansing before God
It does, but we must realize that 'purify' refers to the purifying of the conscience, not to the purifying of the sinful nature
In the entire Bible, there is no mention of the blood purifying our old nature, nor does it mention the blood purifying the flesh
The cleansing spoken of in 1 John 1:7 does not refer to the cleansing away of inward sin or to cleansing away the root of sin
Whether we feel that our sins are great or small, rough or refined, forgivable or unforgivable, all these sins are cleansed away before God
When we read Numbers 20:2-9 and 21:4-9, we realize how bad the children of Israel were when they were in the wilderness
Leviticus 1630 says For on this day propitiation shall be made for you to cleanse you you shall be clean from all your sins before Jehovah
The 'sin' in 'sin of the world' is singular in number, and the 'sin' in 'cleanses us from every sin' is also singular in number
Neither the 'takes away' in John 1:29 nor the 'cleanses' in 1 John 1:7 can be interpreted as the taking away or cleansing of the root of sin
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
Once God crucified the old man, the body which was subject to sin became useless; it is no longer a slave to sin and is unemployed
Christians ought not to sin; but the way to be victorious is based upon the Word of God and not upon our own concept
Since the Lord Jesus death is a death for all it might seem that a person will not have to die even if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus
Matthew 20:28 says, 'The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many'
The Lord Jesus, on the one hand, died for and on the behalf of the many; on the other hand, He died for all men but not on behalf of all men
John 2:2 says, 'And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world'
Even though they will not pass through the second death, the Bible says that they will suffer the hurt of the second death
Once the gate has been entered, we can turn around and see that 'You are predestinated' is written on the inside of the gate
Once a student of theology went to a servant of God and asked, 'The Bible says God predestinated man to salvation
We should realize that God tells believers that their salvation is predestinated in order to create a thankful heart in them
When we believe, we have eternal life; when we believe, we are saved; and when we believe, we are justified, etc
By His question, the Lord meant, 'You are the one who fell among the robbers, so now which one of these is your neighbor'?
The Lord answered him by saying that the lawyer had fallen among the robbers and that his neighbor was the One who saved him
In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime?
And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself'
Even though man commits sin and evil, God does not punish him by instantly striking him to death with thunder and lightning
But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead'
The Scripture speaks of two kinds of justification: one is justification by faith, and the other is justification by works
We know that the books of Romans and Galatians speak of justification by faith, whereas the book of James speaks of justification by works
He feared that some might not know what God had done, what Christ had accomplished, and how effective the precious blood was
They might have thought that just believing was insufficient and that there was an additional need for man's works in order to be saved
Consequently, we can see that there is a close relationship between justification by faith and justification by works
Verses 2 and 3 say, 'For if Abraham was justified out of works, he has something to boast in, but not before God
Circumcision is like a seal stamped by God, which declares that one is justified by faith and that nothing will change this fact
In any case, the seal has been stamped, and those who are of faith are blessed together with believing Abraham
Being saved in these verses is not a matter of going to heaven in the future, but a matter of being physically warmed and fed in this age
James indicates that faith without works is like the devil who, even though he believes in God, is still the devil
Verse 21 says, 'Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar'?
Since Paul spoke of justification by faith, they might have assumed that just believing is enough and there is no need for any works
Of overturning justification by faith, James actually strengthens it by using justification by works to prove what true faith is
Abraham's offering up of Isaac on the altar was a work, and this work was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness
Abraham gladly received the promises of God; he believed in what God had told him: 'In Isaac shall your seed be called'
God required him to offer up Isaac, the one appointed to be his heir, on the altar, even to be slain and burned
If Abraham truly loved God and was willing to offer up everything to Him and burn Isaac how could Gods promise be fulfilled and accomplished
James says, 'And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 'And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness'
It seems that justification by faith is a prophecy, and justification by works is the fulfillment of that prophecy
Hebrews 1131 tells us By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient since she had received the spies with peace
Finally, he used one illustration: 'For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead'
A living faith must have works, because faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead
The good shepherd looked for the sheep outside the house, and the Lord Jesus left the Father's house to come to the world to look for us
God not only sent the Lord Jesus as a good Shepherd to seek for us, but He also sent the Holy Spirit to enlighten us
The Savior has come, and the Holy Spirit has come to seek so that the Lord's accomplished redemption will not be in vain
If the good Shepherd did not come to lay down His life for the sheep, redemption would not have been accomplished
If this were not so, God would be unrighteous, act contrary to His righteous nature, and be only tolerant of us
The Holy Spirit convicts man of judgment, causing him to question why he follows Satan who has been judged and is no longer his master
We should believe in what the Lord has accomplished and also pay attention to what the Holy Spirit will accomplish
One group of people only stresses what the Holy Spirit will accomplish, neglecting what Christ has already accomplished
Another group emphasizes what Christ has already accomplished, neglecting what the Holy Spirit will accomplish
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
If we only want the Holy Spirit without receiving what Christ has accomplished, it is also impossible to receive the Holy Spirit
The three parables in Luke 15 are not repetitious; they are a portrait of the sequence in God's way of redemption
A proper understanding of these three parables will give us a balanced life, and we will not be biased in any way
Once they are filled with the Holy Spirit, they think that they will be good Christians and have the power to preach the gospel
The Bible tells us that there is only one price for having the Holy Spirit and that it has already been paid by the Lord Jesus Christ
After the resurrection of the Lord, He breathed into the disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Since that day, there is no longer a need to ask for the Holy Spirit; the need now is to receive the Holy Spirit
Consecration is the way to be filled with the Holy Spirit, but the flow of the Holy Spirit is based upon the Lord's blood
The Old Testament records that when the Israelites were in the wilderness, Moses smote the rock and water flowed out of the rock
The priest put the oil in his left hand upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot
The coming down of the Holy Spirit on the leper was not because he declared that he was cleansed, but because of the blood
In order for our ears to listen to Gods voice our hands to do His work and our feet to walk His path we must first be cleansed by the blood
The Holy Spirit had not yet come because Jesus was not yet glorified, not because there was a lack of prayer and desperate begging from men
From this we see that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was the result of the death, resurrection, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus
Others think that only special Christians can receive the power of the Holy Spirit and that a common Christian cannot receive this power
Its price is very high, but it has already been paid by the Lord Jesus Christ through His death and resurrection
If we understand the source of the Holy Spirit, and if we realize that the price has been paid, we will not need to beg desperately
You can thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ which has already paid the price, and you can receive the power of the Holy Spirit
The Bible says that the Lord Jesus Christ was sent to accomplish God's will and that the Holy Spirit has already been poured upon us
On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God'
There is a common misconception that if a person wants salvation, he must desperately plead until God changes His mind
He feels compelled to constantly plead for pity and forgiveness, fearing that God will change His mind toward him
The apostles preached in order to beseech men to be reconciled to God; they never pleaded for God to be reconciled to man
On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God'
Whoever thinks that he must believe and hope does not have a reliable faith and will eventually be one who does not have genuine faith
If a person is willing to deny himself and confess the Lord on earth, the Lord will confess him before the Father in the future
Whoever is afraid of losing face and being put to shame today will certainly lose face and be ashamed in the future
Whoever is not afraid of losing face and being put to shame for the Lord today will certainly be glorified in the future
Romans 10:10 says, 'For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation'
When a person is saved by believing with his heart, he confesses with the mouth and spontaneously calls, 'Abba, Father'
Romans 4:4 through 6 says, 'Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due
To the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness
The faith of the one who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly is accounted as righteousness
For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them'
Verses 8 and 9 tell us that we are saved by grace through the faith which God has given to us and not by our own works
Since the Lord Jesus Christ has already borne our sins and been judged by God, we do not even need to pray; all we have to do is believe
The cross has fully accomplished the work of redemption so that whoever believes in what God has done shall be saved
Let us read the following verse which says, 'How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed'?
Even though Mark 16:16 says, 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved,' we have to pay attention to what the word 'saved' refers to
Having eternal life is a personal matter of receiving eternal life, but being baptized is to be saved out of a sinful realm
If a person only believes but is not baptized, although he has eternal life, in the eyes of the world he is still not a saved one
In other words, the requirement for not being condemned is just believing; it is not baptism in addition to believing
When we confess one sin, one strip is taken off the cross, while the sins which we have not confessed are still hanging there
We cannot find a passage in the Bible that says a sinner must believe and confess his sins before he can be saved
Jesus Christ has accomplished redemption, and whoever believes the testimony God gave of His Son will be saved
The book of Romans presents the matter of salvation very clearly, yet this book does not mention that salvation is by any kind of work
The Gospel of John is the clearest book concerning the gospel, yet it contains no indication that salvation is by repentance
If a person never has a change in his view concerning sin, himself, the world, and the Lord, he cannot be saved
Ephesians 1:13 says, 'Having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing'
Some people say that they believe, but actually, they only agree with the doctrines-they do not really believe in Christ
We should have good works, confess Christ before people, confess our sins, repent, be baptized, and pray frequently to be pleasing to God
Let us first explain the meaning of this sin and then come to the conclusion that it is not possible for anyone to commit this sin today
Verse 29 says, 'But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an everlasting sin'
We have not said that wonders and miracles were done by the devil while assuredly knowing that they were done by the Holy Spirit
He said, 'If you can grieve for your sins, you have not committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit'
The devil knows that man will be saved when he believes; therefore, he is fearful lest any man believes and is saved
Whoever blasphemed against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, because he 'is guilty of an everlasting sin'
In hell, there is suffering because of a lack of water to the point that there is not enough water to even wet the tip of the finger
Do not say in a light way that the work of this person is of the Holy Spirit or the work of that person is of the evil spirits
There are several books in the New Testament which closely resemble one another, such as Ephesians and Colossians, and Galatians and Romans
Ephesians says that the church is the Body of Christ; Colossians then turns around and says that Christ is the Head of the church
Paul told them, 'You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
From Galatians 5:1 we know that they had entered into grace: 'Stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again'
When a Christian who is free comes to the presence of God, he only remembers that he is acceptable to God because of the Lord Jesus
He forgets himself and does not look at himself, but only remembers that his coming to God's presence is by the blood of the Lord Jesus
If he treats people well, reads his Bible with joy, and prays long prayers during the day, he is bolder when he comes to a meeting
He thinks that God is pleased with him if he does well and that God is displeased with him if he does not do well
Consequently, from morning until evening he makes an iron yoke for himself, a yoke composed of the strictest laws to keep
Hebrews 10:29 tells us that it is a great sin to count the blood of the covenant by which man was sanctified a common thing
If this is the case, then this means that although one has been saved and has gained eternal life, there is a possibility for him to lose it
They should have been able to take in solid food and learn the word of righteousness yet unfortunately they were still those who needed milk
When building a house, one does not lay a foundation and then not build upon it but instead lay another foundation
The word 'again' in 'renew themselves again unto repentance' is the same Greek word used in 'not laying again a foundation'
If one has experienced these four items, it is impossible for him to renew his repentance again just because he has fallen once
It is impossible for him to crucify the Son of God again and put Him to open shame, even if he wishes to do so
If a person falls, it does not mean that he has forsaken the course which he was on; his direction is still correct
It is used once in verse 1: 'Not laying again a foundation,' and also in verse 6: 'To renew themselves again unto repentance'
In the second section, he tells them that even if someone falls, he cannot renew his repentance again and cannot lay a foundation again
Not only does one not need to lay another foundation or repent again, but even more, it is impossible to do so
Although verses 1 through 3 tell us that we need not and verses 4 through 6 tell us that we cannot verses 7 and 8 tell us that we should not
We should not fall away again and again, nor should we sin, as if to put the Son of God to open shame by crucifying Him again
Paul said he buffeted his body and brought it into subjection lest by any means when he preached to others he himself would be disapproved
God's punishment for the believer who sins is to put him outside of glory and into darkness, so that he has no share in the kingdom
On the one hand, our salvation is sure, yet on the other hand, if we do not do well, we will receive punishment
Hebrews 6:1-3 tells us that we do not need to lay a foundation again; verses 4 through 6 tell us that we cannot lay a foundation again
Those who think in this way think that this passage is for Christians and that if a Christian sins willfully, he cannot be saved
We have to look into this portion of the Word carefully to find out if the ones who sin willfully are Christians or other people
We must also consider the meaning of sinning willfully and see if this refers to sin in general or to some particular sin
The people mentioned here are different from those in Hebrews 6:4, 'who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift'
There are certain people who know about the death of the Lord Jesus, the shedding of His blood, and the purpose of His body being broken
There no longer remains a sacrifice for sins for this kind of people, who sin willfully after they have known these truths
Does this not show that Paul clearly knew that he should do good but did not do good and instead did the things he hated?
Even though a person has heard God's Word which says that Jesus is the Son of God, he says that Jesus is a bastard
For this kind of people, the Bible declares, 'There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins'
Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself
Hebrews 10:10 through 12 says, 'By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
If he committed a trespass a second time, he would have to offer up a sin offering as an atoning sacrifice again
One offering had to be made for the trespasses of last year; another offering had to be made for the trespasses of this year
In the Old Testament, if a person missed the opportunity for atonement one year, he might still have an opportunity the following year
If he knows the truth and still rejects Him, then 'there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins'
His end is nothing but 'a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries'
The fourth consequence is chastisement in this age; whereas the fifth consequence is chastisement in the coming age
Matthew 26:28 says, 'For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins'
Do not think that we were forgiven because we repented for our past sins and resolved not to commit any sins in the future
If we believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus, we will see that our sins have been laid upon Him and that we are forgiven
Let us read 1 John 2:12: 'I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name'
They are not will be forgiven but have been forgiven not expected to be forgiven or waiting to be forgiven but have been forgiven
John 20:23 says, 'Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained'
Whosever sins you forgive' means that the church declares that the sins of a certain man have been forgiven and he is saved
If the brothers are not clear from within, they cannot make such a testimony for such a one; therefore, they cannot receive him
Based upon the power and instruction of the Holy Spirit, the church determines whether one's sins have been forgiven
If a person is saved, and the church is not sure and asks him to wait for a little, this will not affect his forgiveness before God
Only after Barnabas testified for him was Paul able to be with the disciples coming in and going out in Jerusalem
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
The Gospel of John deals with the matter of salvation; whereas 1 John deals with the matter of fellowship with God
The beginning of 1 John speaks of the matter of fellowship, and chapters one and two speak on the forgiveness in this fellowship
Some may commit a sin and stay in their bad feelings for several days, thinking that God could not forgive them so quickly
While we should have a sorrowful and penitent heart for our sins, our forgiveness does not depend upon our sorrow
If we confess our sins, God will forgive us through the blood of the Lord, and the fellowship between God and us will be restored
Samuel 22:26 and 27 say, 'With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,/and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright
Galatians 6:7 and 8 say, 'Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap
For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life'
He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh; but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life
Committing sin not only causes man to have a sinful record before God but also brings suffering as a consequence
We gain eternal forgiveness as soon as we believe; we gain forgiveness for the restoration of fellowship as soon as we repent
His hair grew back again, and the fellowship between him and God was restored, but his ministry as a judge was not recovered
If God had not disciplined David, the whole world would have said that Jehovah was pleased with David in committing these sins
We need to pay attention to the fact that if we sin against a brother, a sister, or someone, we must take care of the matter
Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
Nor is it forgiveness to restore fellowship, because the forgiveness of fellowship can be obtained as soon as one confesses his sins
The Lord, however, has already been chastened for us; chastening is a part of the work of the Lord's crucifixion
Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world
On the other hand, we need to exercise our will daily to resist the devil, proclaiming that we refuse to be sick or weak
For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves
His fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place
If we cannot differentiate between the various kinds of forgiveness in reading the Scripture, we will encounter difficulties
He said, 'So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts'
The fourth kind of forgiveness is received when God sees that the time of chastening is fulfilled, and He takes away the rod of discipline
The works which many consider as superior may be judged as impure, improperly motivated, and quite mixed in the eyes of the Lord
James 2:13 says, 'For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment'
If you are daily forbearing, do not try to find fault, and are generous with others, God will also forgive you on that day
For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you'
Do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God'?
If we give to others, God will give to us abundantly and richly repay us with a measure not only full to the brim but also running over
God will not allow two people in His kingdom to be divided against each other, nor will He permit hatred in the hearts of His people
Do not think that serving in the church is a great thing; in the future, the things of the kingdom will be much greater
If we cannot deal with things pertaining to this present life, how can we be qualified to judge angels in the future
The first kind of salvation is eternal salvation before God, which we obtained the moment we believed in the Lord
Acts 15:11 says, 'But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved in the same way also as they are'
By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead, we are born again, given eternal life, and become the children of God
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
We have been made children of God and have received sonship not according to our condition but according to the predetermined will of God
God has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose
Our love may easily change, but God's love is deeper than the love of a mother ; it is eternal , to the uttermost , and unchanging
The grace of God is sufficient and superabundant; it is able to bear all our burdens, meet all our needs, and save us to the uttermost
The Lord Jesus received the judgment of God's righteousness on the cross for us, thereby satisfying the requirement of God's righteousness
A life relationship can never be broken, and since we have the eternal life of God within us, we shall never perish
It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
No one can negate the Lord's redemption which He accomplished for us by His death and resurrection, and no one can condemn us
He must rise up and be baptized, proclaiming to men that his sins have been forgiven and that he belongs to the Lord
Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them'
Paul said, 'Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us'
God had delivered them in the past, He was delivering them then, and they expected that He would deliver them in the future
God will send His angel to encamp round about those who fear Him to deliver them out of the troubles in their environment
Since our whole being is composed of three parts-spirit, soul, and body , our salvation involves the salvation of these three parts
The salvation of our spirit occurred at the time we believed in the Lord, when we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
The salvation referred to here requires a price; one has to lose the soul and sacrifice the soul in order to gain the soul
He sacrifices his own soul for the Lords sake and by doing so will enter into the millennial kingdom and participate in the joy of the Lord
If we can endure the suffering and sacrifice temporary joy for the Lord's sake, when He comes we shall enter into the joy of the Lord
If we deny the self today for the Lord's sake, the Lord will give us something that is truly our own in the future
Believers who preserve their soul and the pleasure of their soul in this age will lose the joy during the kingdom age
Whosoever will lose his soul and its pleasure in this age, will save his soul and have the enjoyment in the coming kingdom
Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls'
The salvation of the soul requires that we put away all filthiness and malice in our conduct and receive the implanted word in meekness
For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you'
The salvation of the soul is the salvation into the kingdom of the heavens- the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
From the Old Testament to the New Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, sanctification means to be separated unto something
They all needed to be separated, and a declaration needed to be made that they were sanctified and belonged to Jehovah
The Lord is different from any other man because He is the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father , and He is holy
In the Old Testament times when a man offered a gift, did the gift sanctify the altar, or did the altar sanctify the gift?
Before offering the gift on the altar it belongs to man, but once it is offered on the altar it belongs to God
The people do not change in themselves, yet they become separated and are sanctified because of their believing husband, wife, or parents
When a Christian receives the Lord, not only is he forgiven of his sins and justified; he is also sanctified before God
Romans tells us that although we are sinners, God has forgiven our sins and justified us through the death of His Son
The believers at Corinth had the position of sanctification, but they did not yet bear the fruit of sanctification
But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
God has not only forgiven our sins and justified us, but He also reckons us as worthy, as being saints because of the Lord Jesus Christ
Whenever we stand on this position and come to God through Christ, God sees us as holy in Christ and accepts us as He has accepted Christ
But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life'
Thank God that having been freed from sin and separated unto God, we are enslaved to God and should have our fruit unto sanctification
For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness'
