   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Is this identification the result of the work of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Submission to the Discipline of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bringing In Identification</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Nee answered: Identification is not a oneness of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, if the feeling within me is different from yours, we will not be the same no matter how much we try to talk things over with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Water is water, and wine is wine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One does not see the water turned into wine every day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we do not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our circumstances, we will fall behind in the matter of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a platoon of soldiers is marching along, and one of them disobeys the captain, he will automatically become out of step with the rest of the platoon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Christians there is no such thing as circumstances; there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, the Lord has given us His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything around us is under His sovereign arrangement, and nothing is a coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What the Holy Spirit is doing within us matches what He has sovereignly arranged outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is for our good Rom 8:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever He sees that we need, He arranges those things outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man does not submit himself to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he will come into conflict with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If he is not under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, surely there is no possibility of identification, and surely he will not be able to identify himself with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Identification with the Head Being Mystical, whereas Identification with the Body</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being Practical</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believers' identification with the Head is a doctrine that has been preached for years, but we have to say that the result is quite abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, I consecrate myself to the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Tomorrow, I may take back my consecration, and nobody will know anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, everything mystical has to be turned into something practical.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once something is turned from a mystical one to a practical one, it will not be so easy to dispense with the matter any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, if a person has consecrated himself in a practical way, it will not be easy for him to take back his consecration anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he does, everyone will see that this brother has drawn back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to realize that the oneness of the Body is something that is visible; it is not empty talk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fact, if we are identified with the Head, we will surely be identified with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a person identifies himself with the Body, he is identifying himself with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is something visible and measurable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John said that if a man cannot love the brothers whom he has seen, he cannot love God whom he has not seen 1 John 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible to have two persons submitting to the Head, yet fighting with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would rather declare that I am submitting to the Body than to declare in a falsely spiritual way that I have no problem with the Head and that I am submitting to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To Be Identified with the Head</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>without Being Identified with the Body</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being to Live in Deceit</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, everywhere we see men living in deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These ones should learn to go along with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you go along with the church, you will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man identifies himself with the Body, he will surely be identified with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if a man says that he is identified with the Head, yet does not identify himself with the Body, he is living in deceit.</S>
