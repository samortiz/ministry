   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Recently the Cleveland area called a gathering for those who had been in the full-time training in Taipei to train some of the other full-timers and anyone available to go.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For three days fifty saints went out, and they baptized over forty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Saints, wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not think that there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord that He has shown us the way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fifty saints going out and baptizing over forty people within three days should be enough to wake up all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would we remain in a drugged situation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I were one of the elders or co-workers, I would tell the saints that from now on I will go out to knock on doors morning and evening, every day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our main work from now on is to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you went out in such a desperate way, do you not think you could gain one per day?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have aggressive desperation, you have to be "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person is in a burning building and is desperate for his life, he will jump out of the window.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not get someone baptized within a short period of time, we need to be desperate to "jump out of the window," to do anything and everything it takes to get someone baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why would we not go out in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the elders need to "go on strike" from their congregation and go out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then every home you gain will be a "chapel."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After one year, you can set up one hundred "chapels."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some of the homes you go to may even prepare a dinner for you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The trainees in Taipei reported that some homes even gave them gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They felt that they owed the saints something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Saints, wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now is the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders need to realize that the church is not theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the church of God 1 Cor 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the saints will not fire you as their "pastor," you need to fire yourself by the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Blessed are all the elders who fully give themselves to go door-to-door.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The elders should leave some of the prayer meetings and the Lord's table meetings to the saints and go to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a month of going door-to-door, you can have the Lord's table in the homes you gain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders need to go to create the increase, and their wives need to give up all their opinions and follow their husbands to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You do not need to close the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The hall is not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It belongs to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just go to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can gain sixty within a short time and have the Lord's table with these new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not say there is no way; there is a way, and the Lord has shown us the way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has dedicated this way; He has cut this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matthew 25:14-30 is a parable for faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The slothful slave seemingly did not do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not lose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What the Lord gave him, he kept throughout all the years until the Lord came back v. 25 . He even gave the Lord a message pointing out that the Lord was a hard man, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not scatter v. 24 . Did the Lord justify him? He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Right away the Lord condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The slothful slave should have taken the Lord's word solemnly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was not desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just to keep what the Lord gave you is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wants the interest, the fruit.</S>
