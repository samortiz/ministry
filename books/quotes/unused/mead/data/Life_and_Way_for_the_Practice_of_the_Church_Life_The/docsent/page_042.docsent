   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FACTORS OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Divisions come into existence due to two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One factor is related to the Lord's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no doubt that the ministers, the servants, of the Lord work for the Lord by trying their best to help people through preaching and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But eventually nearly all the servants of the Lord keep the results of their work in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A servant of the Lord may be called by God and sent by the Lord with a real ministry and a real commission.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then he goes out to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He works hard and effectively to help people, and he eventually gains some real results.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the problem or the danger here is that this very servant of the Lord may keep the results of his work in his own hands to form something as a support to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this happens, a division is created.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us illustrate in this way: Here is the apostle Paul, who is sent by the Lord with a real commission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He comes to Los Angeles and works very hard with much effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, a great number of people are saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So his work issues in a great result, and he keeps the result of his work in his hands for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then after three years, Apollos comes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is also sent by the Lord with a real commission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He works hard and effectively, and a great number of people are saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Like Paul, he keeps his work in his hands and forms something in Los Angeles other than what Paul has formed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So now in Los Angeles there is something of the apostle Paul and there is something else of the Lord's servant Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After another two years, Peter comes and he does the same thing as Paul and Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So now in Los Angeles there are three groups of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should not call them churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best you can say is that they are three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter what you call them, whether denominations, missions, sects, congregations, assemblies, or "churches," they are divisions, and even if you call them nothing, they are still divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here the servants of the Lord have to learn the lesson from history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of us should keep the work in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to work for the Lord, for His church, and for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result, the issue, of the work must go to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing should be kept in the hands of any of the Lord's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did go to Corinth and worked there effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although many were saved through him, he did not set up his own group.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He worked for the local church which was in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apollos and Peter also did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There were not three "churches" in Corinth, one of Paul, another of Apollos, and still another of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was only one church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, although Paul, Apollos, and Peter did not do this kind of divisive work, the pitiful Corinthian believers did something to separate themselves from one another 1 Cor 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some would say, "I appreciate Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am of Paul."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others would say, "I appreciate Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is an eloquent man and is powerful in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am of Apollos."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And still others would say, "Peter is the greatest one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am of Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, some would say, "You are all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not belong to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We belong to Christ alone, so I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So there were four groups in Corinth, and they were condemned by the apostle for being carnal, fleshly 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Look at today's Christianity, and you will see that the same situation exists there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that the local churches do not belong to the apostles or the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the churches of God 1:2 , the local churches belong to God; as the churches of Christ Rom 16:16b , they belong to Christ; and as the churches of the saints 1 Cor 14:33b , they belong to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The churches must not belong to any of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The churches are neither for the workers, the ministers, nor for the work, the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, the workers or ministers and their works or ministries must be for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I come here to carry out a work, and keep the results of my work in my hands, this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After much laboring, the apostle Paul had nothing in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything was left in the hands of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to realize that as long as you keep the results of your work in your hands, you have a sect, a division, in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to keep your hands off the results of your work and leave the results to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us follow the footsteps of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many churches were established through him, yet in the end he kept nothing in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So Paul did not create any division.</S>
