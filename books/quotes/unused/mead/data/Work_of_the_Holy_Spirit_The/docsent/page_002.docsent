   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; John 20:22; 14:16-17; Rom 8:2; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30; 1 John 2:20, 27, 1; John 14:26; 15:26; 16:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of the Holy Spirit is a great and deep subject.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages we cannot go into detail on this subject, but we will cover some main points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE DIVINE TRANSMISSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we know, God is one God in three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we call Him the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that there are three Gods, but rather one God in three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the communion, the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is the source in eternity, in a realm to which we cannot go and which we cannot touch 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Word of God, the expression of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we still need another Person, the Spirit, so that all that God is as the Father and is expressed in the Son might be transmitted, communicated, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Spirit is the transmission, the communion, of what the Father is and what the Son of God expresses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may illustrate the Triune God in His divine economy with water in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first stage is the water in the source, the fountain, and the second stage is the water in the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The water comes out of the fountain as the source, and the spring contains the water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third stage is the flow, the current to flow out the water, to bring the water to all places, to reach other places with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are not three different waters, but one water in three stages the water at the source, the water in the spring, and the water in the current.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God the Father is the source; Christ, who is God the Son, is the divine well, the divine spring; and the Holy Spirit is the divine flow, the divine current to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is as the Holy Spirit that God in Christ can visit us and reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Himself, God the Father cannot reach us, and even when expressed in God the Son, He still cannot reach us today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is as the Spirit and by the Spirit that God the Father in God the Son can reach us, visit us, come upon us, and come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, in the divine economy, the Spirit is the third and last stage in which God comes out to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the teachings of the Scriptures, the work of the Holy Spirit is in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not clear about the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit, we cannot properly know the truth concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several verses speak clearly concerning these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 7:37-39 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this passage, there are two main points to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, the Spirit, whom the disciples were about to receive, would be in them and would flow out from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the Holy Spirit here is likened to water for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anyone who thirsts can come to the Lord and drink of this living water, who is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, John 14:17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These verses clearly say that the Spirit is the living water to drink, and He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is one aspect of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke 24:49 shows us the other aspect of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It says, "And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The promise of the Father is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please notice the word upon; it is different from in. We all know the difference between upon and in. In this verse, the Holy Spirit comes upon us, not into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To put on power is to be clothed with power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Gospel of John the Holy Spirit is likened to living water to drink, but in the Gospel of Luke the Holy Spirit is likened to clothing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Water is different from clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we drink water, it is within us, and when we put on clothing, it is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit upon us as clothing is the power from on high, while the Spirit within us as the water we drink is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, we have the Spirit within us as life, and on the other hand, we have the Spirit upon us as power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit within us as life is likened to water for drinking, and the Spirit upon us as power is likened to clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament, when Elijah was taken up into the heavens, he left his outer garment, his mantle, to Elisha 2 Kings 2:9-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In that way Elisha received the power which Elijah had.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The mantle is an item of clothing, signifying that Elisha was clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord ascended to the heavens as Elijah did, and He sent His Spirit as clothing down from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we are clothed with this power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit is within us as the water we drink, and on the other hand, the Holy Spirit is upon us as our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are two different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Luke also wrote the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Acts 1:5 says, "For John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 8 continues, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 5 says the disciples would be baptized in, not merely with, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are baptized in water, we are put into the water, and the water is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same way, we have been baptized in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the power in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This baptism was accomplished on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven upon the disciples, and they were baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
