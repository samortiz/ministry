   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the degradation of Christianity this life matter has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as the life matter is lost, the expression of God is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's recovery is just to recover the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not to recover baptism by Immersion or other kinds of truths or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those are too small.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those are not so central.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The central recovery of the Lord is to recover the divine life within us that God may have His expression among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the main item, the central thing, that needs to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are here in the Lord's recovery, in the church life, not for the recovery of certain doctrines or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are here for the recovery of the divine expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are here for the central recovery of the divine life which we are possessing and enjoying and living by day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we have this central recovery, we have all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We don't need any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This central recovery regulates and governs us everyday.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church we don't have regulations as to what the members should wear, but surely the life within would not allow you to wear certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The recovery of the divine life within us for God's expression governs us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes you may be tempted to dress in a certain way, but the divine life is within you regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We don't have a regulation that says all the sisters in the church life should have their skirts a certain length.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But sometimes sisters have burned their short skirts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why would they do this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The living God within them who is their life required this of them!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A few days ago I went to the department store to buy a tie.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I picked up the ties and looked at them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We don't have a regulation in the churches of the Lord's recovery which says not to wear fancy ties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I just simply don't have the permission to wear such a fancy tie.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who regulates me?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not Jesus outside of me and not even Jesus on the throne, but the very Jesus who is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the living Jesus who is my life daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life within me regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you like to eat bitter things?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you put something bitter in my mouth, I would spit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if you put something sweet in my mouth, I would swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within us there is a taste of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life works, life serves, life regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the regulation today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one who has Christ within surely wants to be buried under the water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He wants to get rid of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not that there is a kind of doctrine and practice concerning immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the life within causes us to want to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among all the saints in the churches in the Lord's recovery there is no regulation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We only have the divine life within recovered to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Also we have the Holy Word in our hand for the development of the inner life and for the light of our pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We don't have any regulations; we only have the recovery of the divine life within us for the expression of God.</S>
