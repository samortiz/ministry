<h2 class=head2>To Repent Being to Have a Change of Concept</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, “Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God,” He seemed to be saying, “Nicodemus, you are wrong. I did not come to be a teacher. You have already had Moses as your teacher. He was quite old and lived to be one hundred twenty years of age. You have already received a great amount of teaching from him. I did not come to be such a teacher. For such a long time Moses taught you how to conduct yourselves as humans, yet regardless of how much you Pharisees and Sadducees have tried, you do not look like humans; rather, you look like vipers. You have to give up! No matter how much you are taught, you cannot get into the kingdom of God. The only way to enter into the kingdom of God is to receive God as life and to gain God Himself. This is regeneration. Therefore, to repent is to have a change in your concept. You have to change your concepts about Moses, your concepts about the law, and even your worldly, natural concepts about serving God. All these concepts need to be changed. Therefore, you must repent!”<p>In our study of the Bible we need to pay attention to the background. John the Baptist came out and said, “Repent!” In actuality, this word may be translated as “have a change of concept,” which means to have a change in our thinking and in our philosophy. In Greek, the basic definition of this word is to have a change of mind issuing in regret and thereby to have a turn in purpose; hence, the sense it conveys is stronger and more serious than the common understanding of the word repent. At that time the Jews, particularly the Pharisees, were filled in their mind with Moses’ teachings and laws. They thought about and discussed Moses and the law all day long. This is why John told people to change their concept.<p>The changing of one’s concept is a strict requirement. Unless this happens, no one can enter into the kingdom of God. The law of Moses taught people how to conduct themselves. It said, Do not murder, do not lie, do not steal, do not bear false testimony, honor your parents, and earnestly care for others. Moses’ teachings, however, could only cause people to be lawful in the human kingdom; they could not bring them into the kingdom of God. It was in this situation, with this background, that John came. From the very beginning he told people to have a change of concept because God’s world, God’s kingdom (which is God Himself) had drawn near and was right at the door. Hence, John charged people to change their concept quickly, not to hold on to Moses any longer, and to have a turn in purpose by receiving Jesus Christ (who was God become man, who was the very God Himself, and who was the reality of the kingdom of God). This is to have a change of concept, a change from the law to God Himself and from Moses to Jesus Christ. Only by receiving Him can men enter into the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head2>To Enter into the Kingdom of God Being to Receive God into Us</h2><p>Now we all understand that the kingdom of God is God Himself. Following John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God has drawn near” (Mark 1:15) when He went out to minister. In other words, John was saying, “God is on the way; He has drawn near.” For example, if you have a friend who is coming to visit you, and he is already on the way, then you will say, “My friend has drawn near. He will be here in just a short while, so I have to prepare to receive him.” Similarly, to proclaim that the kingdom of God has drawn near is to declare that God Himself has drawn near and that men should get ready to receive Him into them. The way to prepare is to put away the old, natural concepts and to hold on to the New Testament revelation, knowing that to enter into God’s kingdom is to receive God Himself. This is the central thought of the preaching of John the Baptist as the forerunner in the New Testament dispensation.
