   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 The Bible does not say that the elders' white garments have been washed in the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In other places, when a white robe is mentioned, it says that the robe has been washed in the blood of the Lamb Rev 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Bible mentions white garments, does it not refer to the righteousness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the elders' white garments have never been washed in the blood of the Lamb, does this mean that they have no sin?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the church has been washed in the blood of the Lamb, how can the elders who are not washed in the blood of the Lamb represent the church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 The song that the elders sing is not the song of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 4:11 says, "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The song that the elders sing is concerning God's creation; it is not the song of their redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 5:8-10 says, "The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb...And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this is the song of redemption, they praise the Lord for redeeming others, not for their redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the old Chinese translation and the English King James Version are wrong in translating "men" into "us."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the "men" is translated into "us," then how can the following word "them" make sense?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Chinese version translates "them" in verse 10; but the English King James Version translates "us."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among all of the reliable scholars who have studied the manuscripts, none consider it reliable to translate "men" into "us."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But those who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation hold onto such an unreliable translation tenaciously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can this be a valid reason?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can we say the twenty-four elders are the church, even though the song they sing is for the redemption of others?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does this make sense?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6 The elders are the elders in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 4:4 says, "And upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 4:7 says, "And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The things mentioned here are not the church, the Jews, the Gentiles, or the earth; the sphere here is the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can the church be considered as the elders of the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If not, then the twenty-four elders here surely are not the church; they are the elders of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>7 Revelation 5:8 says, "And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is interesting to see that in this verse the prayers of the saints were brought to God by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church can pray, and the church can pray for others, but the church cannot bring the prayers of others to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not what the church does; the church has never done this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is obvious that the elders are not the raptured church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>8 In 7:13-14, it is interesting to note that there are three kinds of people: the elders, John, and those who came out of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elder asked John who they were and where they had come from.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John answered, "My lord, you know."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we say that the twenty-four elders represent the church, and John also typifies the raptured church, then we face a tough problem, because the elders asked John, and John asked the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This would mean that the representative is asking the representative, the type is asking the type.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This would make the church asking the church who they were, and the church asking the church where they came from.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>9 In Revelation 7:14, John called one of the elders "my lord," but the elder did not correct John by telling him not to call him lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is obvious that John's position is lower than that of the elder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John confessed that the elders' position was higher.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the elders are the church, then John is an elder too.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If John is also an elder, he would only need to call the elder "brother."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did John call him "my lord"?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We conclude that the elders are not the raptured church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>10 The number twenty-four should be interpreted literally: it is not a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the book of Revelation, John said that one of the twenty-four elders was speaking to him a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is obvious that there were literally twenty-four elders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the number twenty-four is a literal number and not a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the twenty-four elders are the church, then one of the twenty-four elders speaking to John means that one twenty-fourth of the church was speaking to John.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If twenty-four here is a literal number, the elders must be literal too.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the number twenty-four is not a sign, the elders are not a sign either.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot consider the elders as a sign and consider the number twenty-four as a literal number.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, it becomes completely absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, it does not make sense for some to say that the twenty-four elders are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The twenty-four elders cannot be the church.</S>
