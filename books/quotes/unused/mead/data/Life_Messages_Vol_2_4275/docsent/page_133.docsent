   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD PROGRESSIVELY REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is revealed in the Bible in a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The different names for Him are gradually introduced, each indicating something further about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 1:1 He is called God, and we are told that He created the heaven and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 2 the title Jehovah is added, and we are told that "Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul" v. 7, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come to the New Testament, we have Jesus Christ Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that God, Jehovah, and Jesus Christ refer to three different Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are all names for the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word Jesus simply means Jehovah is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus Christ is not distinct from the Jehovah of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout the Gospels He is usually called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Acts the Spirit descends 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This term, the Spirit, is used over and over again in the Epistles e.g., Rom 8:5; Gal 3:2-3; Eph 4:3; 1 Tim 4:1; 1 John 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in Revelation there are the seven Spirits Rev 4:5; 5:6 , and finally, in the last chapter, the Spirit and the bride 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Be assured that all these terms refer to the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe in this one God, as revealed throughout the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If your God is only God and Jehovah, you are in the same position as the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most Christians claim to believe in all sixty-six books of the Bible, but as far as their practical living goes, their experience does not reach to Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the Spirit, they have not much understanding nor experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus today is more than the Savior, the One who shed His blood to cleanse us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After His resurrection, as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last Adam is simply the incarnated Jesus Christ, who was crucified for us, was buried, and then in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Corinthians 3:17 states, "Now the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That "Lord" here is referring to Christ, not God, is clear from the context.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 14 says the veil is done away in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 16 continues that when the heart "shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Obviously Christ and Lord are interchangeable here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A few verses farther on, in 4:5, there is another confirmation: "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that Christ is the Spirit offends some Christians; it seems to them we are mixing up two of the Persons of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have no obligation to support the traditional explanation of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our interest and our concern is with what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Martin Luther in his day defied the traditions of Catholicism when he saw the light regarding justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now that truth has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Catholic Church, however, still rejects it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we were in Switzerland last year, we saw a carving of a woman, representing the Roman Catholic Church, who was kicking away two men, Luther and Calvin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity today has a traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The light conflicts with that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have no choice as to which we will accept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible clearly tells us that God took the step of becoming flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He shed His blood on the cross to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He arose from the dead, He took the second step and became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He became flesh to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He became the Spirit to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He can be with our spirit because He also is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The general view is that the Lord Jesus has ascended into heaven and is now sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has sent the Holy Spirit down to us to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such an explanation is based upon one aspect of the divine revelation but disregards all the verses which clearly say that Christ is in us e.g., Gal 2:20; Col 1:27; 2 Cor 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To say that it is the Holy Spirit representing Christ in us is a complicated explanation to support this shortsighted belief, which leans heavily on the side of God being three and is weak on the side of God being one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ and the Spirit are like electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The source of the electricity is the power plant where it is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That electricity is the very electricity which comes into the meeting hall, transmitted as the electric current.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The electric power we use in the meeting hall is not a representative of the electricity in the power plant!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus is the Spirit; He is both in the heavens and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the simple, clear teaching of the Scripture; we do not distort it to fit traditional beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the beginning of the Bible God is revealed as the Creator and later as Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then He became our Redeemer by passing through incarnation, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now He is the life-giving Spirit, with all the experiences through which He passed incorporated into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This all-inclusive Spirit, the processed Triune God, is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The two spirits are mingled as one.</S>
