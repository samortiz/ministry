   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITHOUT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is very meaningful that this letter follows 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that if we would be a person like Paul, living by Christ and taking Him as our person, we must be aware of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we become religious, we become ensnared in the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we look at today s Christians, we can see that so many of them are simply in a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have the teachings, the regulations, the traditions, and the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past I have mentioned several times what a religion is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A religion is the act of doing things for God without the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we worship God without the presence of Christ, that is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we work for God without the presence of Christ, that is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we try to be a good person without the presence of Christ, that is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything for God without the presence of Christ is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Religion is simply to worship God, to work for God, to keep the law, and to improve ourselves and do so many good things religiously without the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It may be good, but it is still a religion because it is without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Jewish religion never taught anyone to worship idols, to commit sin against God, or to be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather it always taught others to worship God sincerely, to serve God faithfully, and to behave honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely this is good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this is what the Apostle Paul called religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was the foremost in such a religion, keeping the law, keeping his forefathers tradition, and observing all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we would enjoy the indwelling Christ, we must beware of all these religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why Paul said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no doubt that the present evil age of the Apostle Paul was the typical Jewish religion, a religion supposedly founded according to the verses of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, if we would realize the real experience and enjoyment of the indwelling Christ, we must beware of anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, I realize that this word does not sound well to religious ears.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we read our Bible in Galatians, we can see that religion is not a positive word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Religion persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Religion damaged the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Religion opposed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we need to be delivered from all the religious teachings, all the regulations, all the traditions, and all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what it means to be delivered from the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST REVEALED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul told us that he was exceedingly zealous in his forefathers religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers Gal 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But then something happened to Paul, and he expresses it in this way: But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me Gal 1:15a, 16a .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ is revealed in us, all the religious matters simply fall off.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul was so zealous for his religion, but on the way to Damascus a voice came from the heavens and smote him to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was blinded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually he was already religiously blind, but he didn t know it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now his blindness became exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the case of so many dear ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They thought they were clear, but they did not realize that they were religiously blinded.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then one day the Lord touched them and exposed their blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul had been so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He knew where to go, and he took the lead to take others there, but now he needed someone to lead him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was made blind by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But, praise the Lord, this blindness eventually became a real vision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul became blind to religion, yet he became clear with a vision concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>CHRIST LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From that time, Paul began to see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It had pleased God to reveal Christ into him, and he was delivered from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why he said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now he is writing that the Galatians might obtain the same deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They had been trapped in a snare of religion, and needed deliverance from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now it is not a matter of keeping the traditions, but of having Christ revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And it is not a matter of keeping the law, but of having Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ should not only be revealed in us, but also live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ has to be both our life and our living.</S>
