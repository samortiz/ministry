There are two supporting factors to show that they have been and are being fulfilled:</P><P>(1) In Revelation 5:2 the angel asked, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?" In verse 7 the Lamb has already taken the scroll. Then how could there be a lapse of two thousand years before the loosing of the seven seals?</P><P>(2) If God does not first take care of the matter of the church (filling up the number of the Gentiles) and then put the church aside, He cannot acknowledge and deal with the Jews (see Rom. 11:25-26). It is in Revelation 7:1-8 that God begins to acknowledge the Jews in choosing them as His servants. But 7:1-8 comes after the first six seals. Hence, we see that the period of time before these six seals is the age of the church.</P><P>By these two proofs we may conclude that during the past two thousand years, these six seals were and still are being fulfilled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRST SEAL-THE WHITE HORSE<br>(REVELATION 6:1-2)</H2><P>"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, Come. And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer."  </P><P>Four horses are declared by four living creatures. We do not as yet know the meaning of this. Perhaps they are declared by four living creatures because there are four horses.</P><P>Who does the "white horse" signify? Three different explanations have been offered:</P><P>(1)It signifies Antichrist. This school gives three reasons for its assertion: (a) Christ will not be riding on a white horse until chapter nineteen; therefore, this is not Christ here. (b) In speaking of the tribulation, Matthew 24 mentions four things, one of them being false Christs; therefore, it should be Antichrist here. (c) There is a bow but no arrow. This shows that there is no real victory.</P><P>(2)It signifies an international peace treaty. The reasons given by this school are: (a) White signifies righteousness; hence, the saints wear white garments, and the Lord rides on a white horse. Peace comes through righteousness. (b) The bow without arrows signifies peace. By these we see that what we have here is the maintaining of international stability and peace by the power of righteousness.</P><P>(3)It signifies Christ. The reasons are: (a) Since the One who sits on the white horse in chapter nineteen is Christ, the One who sits on the white horse in chapter six must also be Christ, whom God crowns. (b) Since the other three horses are given power and authority by God, the first horse must also be given power by God and be crowned by God. Who could that be except Christ? (c) Only Christ goes forth "conquering and to conquer." (d) He carries a bow before He puts on a crown. If there is a bow, there had to be arrows. Since at this time there is only a bow, it means that the arrows have already been shot and that the devil has already been injured. Therefore, God has crowned Him and given Him glory. (e) Among the four horses, only in Revelation 6:4 is the word "another" used. We see from this that the last three horses are different from the first horse. (f) In God's plan the first thing is His Son's victory, the victory of the gospel. (The living creatures say, "Come." In an old manuscript "come" is rendered "go," because the four living creatures do not speak in an imperative tone.)</P><P>Which of the above three assertions is correct? Of course, the third one is more reasonable (the one referring to Christ). Hence, our conclusion is that the white horse signifies Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SECOND SEAL-THE RED HORSE<br>(REVELATION 6:3-4)</H2><P>"And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, another horse, a red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him authority was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and to him a great sword was given."</P><P>"Red" is the color of blood. "To take peace from the earth" means to cause war. The first horse conquers by the bow, so it battles at a distance. The red horse fights with a sword, so it battles face to face. "To take peace from the earth" shows that it is war for the sake of war and not for a just cause. According to the Bible, a war in which men "should slay one another" is the worst kind of war. It brings nothing but death, destruction, and devastation. (See Judg. 7:22; Zech. 8:10; Jer. 25:15-31; Lev. 26:25. All swords bring death, destruction, and devastation.)</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
