<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>1</b> One day when heaven was filled with His praises,</div>
<div class='line'>One day when sin was as black as could be,</div>
<div class='line'>Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin -</div>
<div class='line'>Dwelt among men, my example is He!</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;</div>
<div class='line'>Buried, He carried my sins far away;</div>
<div class='line'>Rising, He justified freely forever:</div>
<div class='line'>One day He's coming - O glorious day!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,</div>
<div class='line'>One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;</div>
<div class='line'>Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;</div>
<div class='line'>Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> One day they left Him alone in the garden,</div>
<div class='line'>One day He rested, from suffering free;</div>
<div class='line'>Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;</div>
<div class='line'>Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,</div>
<div class='line'>One day the stone rolled away from the door;</div>
<div class='line'>Then He arose, over death He had conquered;</div>
<div class='line'>Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,</div>
<div class='line'>One day the skies with His glory will shine;</div>
<div class='line'>Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;</div>
<div class='line'>Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!</div>
