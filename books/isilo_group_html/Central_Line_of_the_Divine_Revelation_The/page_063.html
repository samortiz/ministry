Becoming the Spirit of Sonship<br>for Us to Call God "Abba, Father"</H2><P>After our regeneration, the regenerating Spirit becomes the Spirit of sonship for us to call God "Abba, Father" (Gal. 4:6; Rom. 8:15). Abba is an Aramaic word, and Father is from the Greek word Pater. In Mark 14:36 the Lord Jesus called the Father "Abba, Father." We also should call God the Father "Abba, Father." This calling is sweet because to have such a Father is a great blessing to us. A mother can love us and sympathize with us, but a father is a blessing to us because a father can do many things for us. If we have a good, strong, capable, and rich father, we are very blessed. God is our begetting Father; we have been begotten of Him. This is a blessing to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. As the Writing Ink,<br>Sealing and Saturating Us</H2><P>As the writing ink, the all-inclusive Spirit seals us as a mark of God's inheritance by saturating us to dispense the substance of God into us to form the image of God (2 Cor. 3:3b; Eph. 1:11a, 13; 4:30b; 2 Cor. 1:22a). A seal on something forms the image of the seal on that thing. The Spirit is the writing ink, the sealing substance. The more He seals, the greater is His mark upon us and the greater is His image within us. We bear the image of the sealing God. This is a deeper blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Being the Pledge of God as Our Inheritance</H2><P>As the pledge of God, the Spirit is our inheritance that we may enjoy God today as a foretaste unto the glorification (the redemption) of our body, to guarantee that God will be our full taste in the ages to come (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22b). The pledge is a guarantee that our God is our inheritance. As God's inheritance, we need the sealing, but for God to be our inheritance, we need the guarantee, the pledge. Today we have the Spirit as a foretaste of God, and this foretaste is a guarantee of the coming full taste. Both the foretaste and the full taste are God Himself for us to enjoy.</P><P>The preceding points are some of the items of the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ. This all-embracing blessing is Christ, the threefold seed in humanity, becoming the Spirit. The entire Bible is a book that is concerned with the Spirit. Thus, the more we touch the Spirit, the better. To touch the Spirit requires that we contact Him in prayer and in fellowship with Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
