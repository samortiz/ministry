   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. For the Redeemed of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Return and to Come to Zion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with a Ringing Shout and Eternal Joy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The arm of Jehovah's arising and putting on strength as in the days of old is for the redeemed of Jehovah to return and to come to Zion with a ringing shout and eternal joy 51:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, we are told that God's people need God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because we as God's elect often become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever there is a fall, there is the need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we fell into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Humanly speaking, because we fell into sin, we may feel that we need deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But legally speaking, according to God's economy, we need God's redemption to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human beings do not have such a thought because human beings do not know God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's government always involves the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our falling into sin involves God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For God to come to rescue us is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before God can rescue us, there must be a redemption that fulfills the requirements of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God's elect in both the Old Testament and the New Testament have fallen into sin, they first need God's redemption to fulfill God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, to redeem us from sin is to redeem us from God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we fell into sin, we immediately came under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we were sinful, we were condemned by God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we needed something to fulfill God's righteous requirement so that we could be redeemed from God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, as God's elect, we quite often fall into some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament the children of Israel fell into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In their captivity they needed to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, instead of using the word released, the Old Testament uses the word redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah 51:11 begins, "Therefore the redeemed of Jehovah will return...."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word return indicates what it means to be redeemed here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be redeemed here is to be released from captivity, after which the redeemed ones can return.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, to be redeemed out of a troublesome situation is another aspect of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Israel was under Pharaoh in Egypt, they were suffering as slaves under the Egyptian tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So God came in to send Moses to redeem them Exo 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By these examples we can see that God's Old Testament people had at least three kinds of needs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, they were under God's condemnation; second, they encountered environmental troubles; and third, they were enslaved under a certain kind of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From each of these three things they needed to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the same with God's people in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God redeemed Israel out of Egypt, He established an ordinance that every family had to kill a lamb and then put the blood of the lamb upon their doorposts as a mark for the angel who came to kill all the firstborn sons in Egypt Exo 12:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the killing angel saw that blood, he passed over that house v. 13 . The lamb that was slain was called the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That lamb was for the redemption of God's people out of God's condemnation.</S>
