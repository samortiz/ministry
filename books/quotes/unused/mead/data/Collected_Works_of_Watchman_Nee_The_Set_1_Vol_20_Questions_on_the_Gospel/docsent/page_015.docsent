   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION ELEVEN CONCERNING JESUS' PERSECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What aspect of God is revealed by the persecution of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What aspect of God is revealed by the putting to death of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus' persecution expresses the love of God, and His being put to death expresses the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the earthly life of the Lord Jesus had expressed only righteousness, there would not have been so much opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But since He received the tax collectors and sinners, the Lord Jesus expressed love also, not just righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why the Pharisees criticized Him Matt 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus healed the sick on the Sabbath, the Pharisees took counsel to destroy Him Matt 12:10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus answered the disciples of John the Baptist, saying, "Go, report to John the things that you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them; and blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me" Matt 11:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything that the Lord Jesus has done here is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said, "Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me" because He was afraid that some would be stumbled because of His abundant grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land; and to none of them was Elijah sent, except to the city of Sarepta of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian" Luke 4:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This also expressed love because a widow is a most pitiful person, while Gentiles were despised by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the Lord said these words, the people in the synagogue were filled with rage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They rose up to cast Him out of the city, intending to throw Him over the cliff.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During His entire life, the Lord was under persecution because whatever He did expressed God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's death, however, shows forth God's righteousness because He bore man's sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was judged by God and He fulfilled the requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We thank the Lord that He first becomes the Friend of sinners, and then He becomes the Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He first loves us and then works so that we can believe and receive the redemption He has accomplished on the cross.</S>
