   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TIME OF OUR REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a wonderful point!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, we were reborn when Christ was resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, our regeneration was accomplished once for all nineteen and one-half centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our experience we were reborn some years ago, but from the divine perspective, our regeneration was fully accomplished when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our experience of regeneration is based fully upon its already having been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is one of the many wonderful bequests given to us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>REGENERATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regeneration is an eternal birth relationship and can never be dissolved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No birth can be reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can become unborn once he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as this is a fixed principle in physical life, it is even more solid and substantial in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once we are born of God, we are eternally His children, regardless of our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though we might turn away from the Lord temporarily, the birth relationship can by no means be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This great fact gives us much confidence and boldness in the face of our failures and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No failure can terminate the birth relationship we have with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once our heart is turned again we can come boldly to our Father as His dear child.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE POSITION OF REGENERATION IN GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That purpose is to have on the earth a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This new man is in God's image to express Him and has been committed with God's authority to exercise dominion over the Satan-usurped earth Gen 1:28; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's purpose cannot be accomplished apart from God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only God's life within us enables us to be in the reality of God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only God's life within us enables us to exercise dominion over the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regeneration is our first experience of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The salvation of God is not primarily to save us from hell and to bring us into heaven, but rather to impart His divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By regeneration, we receive His divine life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From our spirit, He is spreading into our soul by the process of transformation, and at His second coming, He will even saturate our body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah for regeneration!</S>
