We must not only be a good Christian, but must also be a good head. Those who do not have a family should first have the qualifications for being the head. Otherwise, they are not qualified to be a husband. Every father and husband must know how to deal with his own family. Once the male becomes loose in a family, the female will assume the headship. Our nation has a president and a vice-president. If the president does not do a proper job, the vice-president will have to take his place. Hence, husbands and fathers must learn to assume the headship in the family. They cannot be too lazy or allow their wives to seize any opportunity to become the head.</p><p>Every male must learn to be a strong head. They should not be cruel, heartless, or severe. But if God has charged them to be the head, they should be proper heads. It is good for husbands to love their wives. But if they love them so much that they allow them to become the head, they have gone beyond God's boundary. A question that may arise is what a husband should do when the wife does not abide in her place. The real issue is that the husband must assume the headship. If he does not assume the headship, the woman will naturally become the head. A woman becomes the head because the man has given her the ground. Is the ground in your family vacant or occupied? As long as you leave a little crack, the woman will try to assume the headship. No one is more desirous of assuming the headship than the woman. The first woman Eve tried to assume headship, and every woman born of Eve is the same as her. Mankind fell to its present condition as a result of Eve assuming the headship. Hence, a man has to stand firm on his ground and not allow the woman to assume an improper standing.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE WIFE'S ASSUMING<br />OF THE HEADSHIP</h2><h2 class="head2">Confessing the Sin of Neglecting to Be the Head</h2><p>What should a man do if he has given up the headship to a woman? First, before the Lord, he must know the reason that he has allowed her to become the head. He has to confess his sin of neglecting to be the head. It is a sin to instigate rebellion in a nation. It is a sin to be disobedient in the church, and it is a sin to relinquish the place of headship in the family. One must thoroughly deal with the Lord concerning such a sin and confess his sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding the Reason That<br />the Wife Assumed the Headship</h2><p>Second, a person has to find the area in which the woman has usurped his position. There can be many reasons for losing his headship. It can be caused by his decline in spiritual life, or his neglect of responsibility. I know of a family whose husband cannot be the head because he only knows to eat; he does not do anything. His wife supports him. As a result his wife spontaneously becomes the head. Another reason that a wife usurps the headship is because the husband cannot be trusted in his opinions. We do not allow some brothers to express their opinions in the church. But such ones think that while their opinions are not accepted in the church, they probably can be accepted in their own family. Many people find that their opinions are unapproved and unacceptable outside their home, yet they try to impose them at home. Their wives cannot go along with their foolish opinions and naturally come up with their own ideas and assume the headship. A third reason that a wife assumes the headship is that the husband has sins which he has not confessed. Others may not know it, but the wife knows it and consequently despises the husband. If one does not have a clear confession, he cannot be the head in a clear way. There are specific reasons that a person cannot assume headship. It may be a difficult thing for a person to find the reason, but there is no alternative other than finding it and dealing with it thoroughly before the Lord. Only then will such a person be able to assume headship once again.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
