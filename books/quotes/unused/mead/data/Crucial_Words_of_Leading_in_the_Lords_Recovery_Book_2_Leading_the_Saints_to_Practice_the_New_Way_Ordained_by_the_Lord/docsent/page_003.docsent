   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TITLE ELDER AND THE ELDERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ORIGINATING FROM EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the title elder and the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two matters were first spoken of in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, the record is mainly regarding individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis speaks of eight great figures Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their history, however, does not reveal much regarding the corporate aspect of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although this aspect is briefly touched upon in the record of the age of Noah, it is addressed in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Noah was then followed by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Beginning with Jacob, the corporate aspect began to come into view more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Jacob, the record in Genesis no longer speaks of individuals; rather, it speaks of the twelve sons of Jacob becoming the twelve tribes of Israel and these twelve tribes becoming a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this point, the corporate aspect appears.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Exodus, the second book of the Old Testament, the age of individuals becomes the age of a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus speaks of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Exodus 19:6 says, You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A kingdom surely refers to something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since a kingdom is a corporate body, it must have an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It cannot avoid the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Exodus not only says that God decreed the law but also speaks of a corporate body, a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without a corporate body, a kingdom, there would be no need for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the law is necessary because a nation, a kingdom, is a corporate body that needs a government.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The basis of this government is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout the six thousand years of human history, regardless of man s experiences, changes, and studies, law has always been the foremost matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in a kingdom there is a great need for law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Exodus there is a kingdom involving the matters of law and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In human government there is often a legislative and executive branch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Exodus, the administration in the Old Testament depended upon a group of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The title elder first appears in Exodus 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter 24 later speaks of seventy of the elders of Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, a corporate body of elders, or an eldership, was formed in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both the title elder and the eldership, a corporate body of elders, are first spoken of in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although elders are spoken of in the Old Testament, this does not mean that they cease to exist in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some teach that everything in the Old Testament comes to an end in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who say this must be very careful; God is in the Old Testament, and God is also in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, the heavens and the earth are in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Knowing the Bible is not an easy matter; one should not simply repeat what others say but must study the Bible carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The heavens, the earth, God, the promise of the gospel, and many other items are found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Galatians 3:8 Paul clearly says that, even as far back as at Abraham s time, God announced the gospel to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God announced the gospel to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, saying that in Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This gospel did not cease to exist in the New Testament simply because it was preached in the Old Testament; on the contrary, this gospel is greatly developed and enriched in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The promise God gave Abraham in the Old Testament is the basis of the gospel in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the New Testament gospel did not begin with John the Baptist; rather, it began long ago in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we read the Bible, we must learn to know the principles and the facts and to see that God s intention is consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From Genesis to Revelation, from eternity past to eternity future, God s intention has been consistent and has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, there are some particular considerations and needs that are reflected in the various procedures, dispensations, and ages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, a door was opened for the law that was neither the front door nor the back door but a door added alongside Rom 5:20 ; this means that the law was not the starting point of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Galatians 3:19 says that the law was added by God because of the transgressions of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, God s intention, from Adam to the New Jerusalem, has always been the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that those who read the Bible are able to see this point.</S>
