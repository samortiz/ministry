<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS NEEDING<br />
TO PRAY MUCH AND TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is not easy to be an elder, because being an elder requires much prayer, learning, teaching, and fellowship. The elders need to fellowship with the saints every day and lead them one by one. The elders should fellowship with and lead one brother today and should fellowship with and lead another brother tomorrow. Then the work of the elders will be effective because brothers will learn how the elders lead the church. This is the way for the saints to be perfected.</p>
<p>Some churches might not have any offspring; in other words, they might not have a second generation. I am afraid that the elders in these localities do not care for people, nor do they pray much, and when they pray, they pray only about problems. This cannot produce offspring. We should not pray concerning the problems of the saints; rather, we should pray for them to be perfected. We should be able to bring the saints into their function, to perfect them, and to build them up. The extent of building up depends on the growth of life, and the growth of life depends on how well a person is fed. If parents do a good job of feeding their children, the children will grow up. Hence, there must be no officials, no self-assumed authority, and no rulers if a local church is to be built up. The Bible says that the elders should not lord it over the allotment entrusted to them by God but should be patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:3).</p>
<p>If the Lord permits, some local churches could practice having no elders for a period of time so that every brother has the opportunity to advance and develop. I am making this proposal because in some localities the eldership has become a system, and the saints have lost their inner spiritual sense. This is not right. If this situation continues, organizations and regulations will be formed among us. The responsible brothers and the elders must understand that they are not officials; they are merely brothers and slaves serving the church.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the elders should live in their spirit and pray much. Everything related to the church should pass through prayer; nothing should be done without prayer. If the restrooms need to be cleaned, the elders should pray, &ldquo;Lord, which brother should be put in charge of cleaning the restrooms?&rdquo; Arrangements can be made after prayer. The elders should bear every saint in prayer and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading on behalf of the saints. Then the elders will receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and know how to lead the saints, including where to place them in the service. This is building. Materials cannot install themselves into a house; they must be built into the house by the builders, according to the need. This is what the elders should do.</p>
<p>The elders should not rule or lord it over people. We should not say, &ldquo;The elders are the authority in the church. Only what they say counts.&rdquo; A brother with this thought should not be an elder. The service and responsibility of the elders are to cultivate the saints, develop their spiritual life, and activate their spiritual function. The elders do not need to rule. Only the Lord Himself is the ruling One. He reigns in everyone. The elders only need to bring the saints into the spirit.</p>
<p>A good elder must be a person of prayer and a person living in the spirit. If a person does not know what it means to live in the spirit or to pray, he will not and cannot be an elder. A person who lives in the spirit and prays at all times will not contact the saints or arrange matters, things, and persons in the church until he has had thorough prayer. Such a person is able to bring others into the spirit of prayer and into fellowship and to build them up in life. The church is not a society that needs socializing. Secular interactions and socializing are the customs of the nations and are filthy leprosy. Only those who pray themselves into the spirit can build up the church and shepherd the church.</p>
<p>If the brothers are to be elders, they must learn this lesson. We must learn to live in the spirit and to pray. If we live in the spirit and pray concerning every matter, we will be different, and the church will also be different.</p>
