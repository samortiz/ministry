	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">CHRIST RECOVERING THE ONENESS<br />
BY LIFE THROUGH THE CHURCH<br />
AND FOR THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; Heb. 2:8-10</h1>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 reveals that God is heading up all things in Christ. God is accomplishing the heading up of all things by His life and through the church. His life is working and operating in the church to the extent that it will shine forth from the church as light to all things; all the nations will walk by its light (Rev. 21:24), and all things will be headed up in the light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Satan Damaging the Oneness by Death,<br />
and Christ Recovering the Oneness by Life</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness in creation by death. When death came in, it brought in darkness, and darkness brought all things into confusion. In contrast, God&rsquo;s recovery is through Christ&rsquo;s life. Life brings in light, and light brings all things into oneness. The following is a simple chart showing the damage caused by Satan and the recovery carried out by Christ:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736330127_06.gif" width="326" height="45" alt="" /></p>
<p>All things are in confusion because Satan brought in death, and death brought all things into darkness; hence, the oneness in creation was damaged. Death carries out a passive work of separation, causing all things to be alienated from God as the center; whereas, darkness carries out an active work of confusion, bringing all things into a chaotic situation. When darkness enters, it causes all things to lose their proper direction and stray from the proper way. For a person to move about on the earth, the way, or road, he takes is important, and even the order of a city is reflected mainly in its roads. However, if there is no light in a city at night, people will not be able to see the roads clearly, and cars might hit electric poles and pedestrians. Hence, the lights in a city maintain the order, harmony, and oneness.</p>
<p>Darkness causes all things to reverse their order and to lose their proper position. When darkness comes, it causes man to lose his position and bearings. For example, if there were no light in our meeting hall, we would need to grope about in the darkness in order to find our seats. However, we are able to sit in an orderly way because the meeting hall has light. Darkness prevents matters from being carried out according to the proper arrangement and order. As long as a person, matter, or thing is in darkness, it is in a state of confusion. The principle is the same in the church. In order for all things to be in oneness rather than confusion, all persons and all matters, whether great or small, need to be headed up under the same administration. Oneness is brought in through light. Without light, all people, matters, and things lose their order and are in chaos.</p>
<p>The principle that life brings in light and light brings in oneness is consistent. We must not receive this merely as a doctrine. We must allow Christ&rsquo;s life to operate in the church to the extent that it shines forth from the church to all things so that all things may be headed up in the light. If the saints are not in oneness when they gather together, it indicates that there is no light among them and that they are in darkness. Death brings in darkness, and the issue of darkness is confusion. In our service, if we do not have a clear and definite way and if our position is not accurate and proper, then darkness, the shadow of death, is still within us. The confusion brought in by darkness can vary in degree. We may be eighty-five percent in light and fifteen percent in darkness, but even with so much light, there is still the shadow of the factor of death.</p>
<p>For example, several sisters may have been touched by the sense of life to consecrate themselves, but they may be unwilling to do so and instead keep asking others for their advice. The result of their asking only brings in more confusion and darkness. If one of these sisters would obey the sense of life and consecrate herself to the Lord, His life would shine out from within her. She would even become a light among the sisters. Whenever she would open her mouth, the other sisters would receive the shining.</p>
