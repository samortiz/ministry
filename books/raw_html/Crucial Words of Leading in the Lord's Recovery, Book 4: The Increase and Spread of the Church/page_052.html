	 <h2 class="head3">The More We Preach, the More We Have<br />
the Moving Power and the Word</h2>
<p>A brother or sister may say, &ldquo;My meeting life is only now becoming normal. I have been greatly blessed by joining a small group gathering, but I am not sure if I am ready to preach the gospel.&rdquo; According to experience, however, we must realize that a normal spiritual life is always advancing. The more we try to merely maintain what we have, the more we will lose it; the more we try to keep it, the more it will leak away. When we go out by faith to speak for the Lord, He will be with us, and our spirit will rise up. The more we go out, the more active our inner man will become, and the more we go out, the more we will have the Lord&rsquo;s word. I believe many of us have had this experience. For example, when we saw saints put on gospel vests, we were scared and even a little embarrassed, but when we put on a gospel vest ourselves, the Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s word emboldened us. This shows that when we go out, the Spirit of the Lord will be with us. The small groups not only join brothers and sisters together through mutual love, care, and concern; they also provide the saints the way to move. Preaching the gospel keeps us in a normal spiritual condition, full of the moving power of life.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the economical Spirit is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. If we want to experience the economical Spirit, we must be in God&rsquo;s move. If we are not in this move, we have no ground to claim the outpoured Spirit. We all desire to experience the Lord, to have a life that is full of power, and to be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. We can achieve this by entering into the Lord&rsquo;s move to carry out His economy. When we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s gospel move, the economical Spirit of the Lord will be upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">New Faces Being the Life Pulse<br />
of Small Groups</h2>
<p>In order to be blessed by the Lord, a small group must be fully related to the gospel. Whenever a small group loses its gospel nature, it will come to a standstill. Whenever there are gospel friends in a small group gathering, the gathering is full of freshness. Without gospel friends, the gathering gradually goes downhill. Every new face, regardless of whether it is weak or even opposing, fills the brothers and sisters with a fresh burden. Before a new one comes, the direction of the meeting may be uncertain, but once he arrives, the direction and utterance become clear. New faces are the life pulse of a small group. As long as there are new ones, there will be burden, feeling, and utterance. Hence, the small groups truly need the offensive function of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Every Brother and Sister<br />
Being a Witness of the Lord</h2>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord said that the disciples would receive power to be His witnesses. This shows that every believer should be a witness of the Lord. We should not have the concept that only preachers and missionaries can be witnesses of the Lord; we all are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In the church there are gifts and offices. With regard to the gifts, there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. With regard to offices, there are elders and deacons. A brother may think that he cannot do anything if he is not an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd-teacher, elder, or deacon. However, he surely can be the Lord&rsquo;s witness. As long as we have the Lord&rsquo;s life, we are witnesses. A witness does not need eloquence or even any gift.</p>
<p>When we hear about preaching the gospel, we often make many excuses, such as saying that we are not eloquent or gifted. We must cast aside all our excuses for not preaching the gospel. We need to strengthen our spirit of gospel preaching as well as the atmosphere of gospel preaching. We need to raise the value of gospel preaching. Some may think that they are not eloquent, but eloquence is not needed. Even the apostle Paul did not have regard for the &ldquo;excellence of speech or of wisdom&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1). There is even no absolute measure of eloquence. Even though some may speak more and others speak less, no one can exhaustively speak of the Lord&rsquo;s grace or fully speak of the mystery of Christ. When we speak of spiritual things, eloquence does not matter, because we all can speak. As long as we open our mouths, we will be able to speak of the things that we have seen.</p>
<p>A witness is one who sees and then testifies. To different degrees, we all have seen the Lord and His grace and mercy. If we have not seen anything, we would not be in the church; if we have not seen anything, we would not come to the church meetings. Since we have seen the Lord, we can be His witnesses. We can testify of the Lord by speaking one sentence or one message; in the eyes of the Lord there is no difference. Whether we speak well or speak poorly, we can still testify. In fact, unbelievers do not pay much attention to how we speak; they want to hear our testimony. When gospel friends come to us, they may not have a strong impression of a gospel message, but they will never forget the testimonies they hear because these testimonies are full of subjective experience.</p>
<p>In this regard, every brother and sister can give a testimony. Although our testimony may not have a spectacular aspect to it, such as the salvation experience of a notorious criminal or of a person with a long and serious illness, it is still a genuine experience that we can speak of to our gospel friends. We should never underrate our experience; it may be a treasure to an unbeliever. For example, we can testify of our lack of inward peace, which caused us to lose much sleep at night and how we found both peace and human rest by believing in the Lord. Even though we think that this is a small matter, it may be the warmest testimony to our gospel friends. Hence, we all can be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
