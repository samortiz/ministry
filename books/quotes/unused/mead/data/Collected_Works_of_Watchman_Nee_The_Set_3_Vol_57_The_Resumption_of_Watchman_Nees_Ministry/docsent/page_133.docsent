   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Oneness with the General Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bringing in Authority</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since you are the church, you have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's authority is with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not think that an individual believer does not have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as an individual believer is one with the general church, he can have authority also, and he can even be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose Brother Lee has offended me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While I am alone with him, I point out his mistake, and the matter is taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While I am taking care of the matter, the church is brought in; the reality of the church is brought in. Of course, in terms of the actual procedure, the church is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible not only can an individual represent the church; the principle of two or three can also be a principle of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When two or three are one, that oneness makes them the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When these two or three deal with anything, it will be the church dealing with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only difference between that and the church actually dealing with the matter is that the church has not said anything directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In actuality, these two or three are one with the church, but the church is not directly involved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, what they say becomes what the church says.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the two or three become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we can see a unique fact of oneness: An individual can have the authority of the church, two or three can have the authority of the church, and the whole church can also have the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Authority of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Other than these authorities, we see before the Lord that God has established some special authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These authorities have to give an account before God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, God established the elders as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has also established the apostles as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Accusations against an elder should be presented to the apostles 1 Tim 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders are the authorities, and the apostles are also the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, the elders have to submit to the authority of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A man should learn coordination before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Submitting to the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Assigned by the Head</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believe that a man should submit to the authority of the Head in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A believer should learn submission in the church to such an extent that his submission means more than his sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should look for opportunities to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every believer should practice submission.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they do this, others will see that there is a group of people who bear a proper testimony in the schools, the hospitals, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here is a group of people who have not overstepped and who maintain their proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the homes you do not see the children dominating the parents or strong wives dominating their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have the light, we will see that God hates confusion 1 Cor 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not we like it, we have to recognize authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once there is authority, there is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we hand ourselves over, not only do we have to offer up our money, but we have to learn coordination as well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to pursue submission, not only to the Lord, but to those whom the Lord has placed in our path.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do this, we will find grace before God, and we will be able to go on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as there are four or five brothers living together, some have to learn to exercise headship, and some have to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever man fails to recognize the sovereign arrangements of the Head, everything falls into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we find submission, we find a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE MEANING OF BEING ONE WITH THE CHURCH The Church Not Being a Matter of Numbers</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A brother asked: A while ago you said that an individual brother can be one with the church, and that once there is oneness, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What kind of oneness does that refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Watchman Nee: This oneness is an identification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Strictly speaking, not only can one individual not call himself the church; even if all sixteen hundred saints in Shanghai are put together, it is equally presumptuous for them to call themselves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation 7, it speaks of those who are clothed in white and who stand before the throne as being countless in number.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The largest number in the book of Revelation is two hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that this countless number is larger than two hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The population of China is only five hundred million, or more precisely, four hundred fifty million.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If among all the Chinese, three thousand of them would set up a flag and declare that they are China, would that not be a joke?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the church is not a matter of numbers.</S>
