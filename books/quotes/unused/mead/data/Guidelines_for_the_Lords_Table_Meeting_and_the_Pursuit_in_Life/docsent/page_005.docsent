   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE LEADING IN THE MEETINGS THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians do not understand the reason they need to meet, but meetings are of supreme importance to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>History shows that meeting is a characteristic of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prior to the existence of the church, mankind did not understand the value and function of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not until the church was produced that men came to know the significance of meeting together, because meeting together enables men to accomplish many things that they otherwise could not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament age, even before the church was produced, God s people lived a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible the unique God called the children of Israel an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had to assemble together when they worshipped God and listened to His instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gathered them together when He was ready to perform a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the forty years in the wilderness, they lived a life of assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After they entered Canaan, the good land, they continued to follow God s command and gather in Jerusalem at least three times a year to worship God corporately by keeping the Feast of Passover the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they gathered together, either the priests or the prophets would instruct them according to the teachings of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Great or important matters among them were also decided in such gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the children of Israel returned from their captivity, Ezra gathered them together and read the law to them Ezra 7:10; Neh 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s people gathered together even in heavy rain to deal with their transgression against God until the whole matter was resolved Ezra 10:7-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the meeting life is a service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus mentioned the church twice: one time concerning the foundation of the church and another time concerning the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter 16 we see that the foundation of the church is Christ as the rock v. 18 . Then in chapter 18, concerning the church life, the Lord said, For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst v. 20 . In the same chapter He also said that if an offending brother refuses to hear the brothers reproof, the brothers should tell it to the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, chapter 18 is on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Acts when the church was ready to be brought forth as a child being delivered from a mother s womb, one hundred twenty people gathered daily in the Lord s presence to pray in one accord 1:13-15; 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church was produced through the gathering of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the church came into existence, those in the church gathered together every day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later they brought three thousand and then another five thousand to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lived the church life together 2:41-42, 46-47; 4:4; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word for church is ekklesia, meaning a called-out congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Chinese the term was rendered as jiao-hui, meaning a religious gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a poor translation, because the church is not a religious gathering but an ekklesia, a gathering of the called-out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The meaning of the word church can be clearly seen in the type of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Israelites were scattered in Egypt, God called them out into the wilderness to become an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though there was no such title as the church, the gathering of those called out by God was the church, the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church life is a meeting life, an assembling life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 10:25 says, Not abandoning our own assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Meeting together is the greatest, most practical, and most effective way for Christians to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Meetings are extremely important to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A good meeting can be of tremendous help to a Christian, and a poor meeting can cause much harm to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not we are edified in our spiritual life hinges on the meetings of our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is in the meetings that we can receive much edification and spiritual help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we receive benefits from praying to God, reading the Bible, and fellowshipping with God individually, and even from fellowshipping with the saints, none of these benefits can be compared with the benefit we receive in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the meetings are poor, we will suffer a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes a meeting might not seem poor, but if the Lord s work, the Lord s presence, and the Spirit s moving are not present, it is a loss to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A saint once shared his feeling with me, saying, If I do not come to the meeting, I have no peace; however, if I come, I feel burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meetings are for worshipping and serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our meetings are burdensome, we need to correct and adjust the meetings so that the saints do not suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a meeting does not have the presence of the Holy Spirit, the saints will feel that the time is going by slowly, but if a meeting is full of the presence of the Holy Spirit, they will sense that the meeting goes by quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the Lord s workers and responsible ones in the church should pay attention to the matter of how to lead a meeting so that the brothers and sisters will benefit and not suffer loss.</S>
