   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HELPING THE NEW ONES TO READ THE BIBLE DAILY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND USE IT FOR THEIR SHARINGS IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should also help the new ones to read the Bible daily and use it for their sharings in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two ways for us to help the new ones read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may teach them in a formal way, but this is a killing way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead we should teach them in a spontaneous way in our talk, our fellowship, with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we help them in a spontaneous and informal way, they will begin to read the Bible daily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we see them after a couple of days, we can informally check with them to see if they are reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By talking to them, we can find out whether they have read the Bible or not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the home meetings we should not do anything formal or legal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HELPING THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO CALL, SPEAK, OR SING A HYMN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should help the new ones to call, speak, or sing a hymn without any formality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should set the example by calling a hymn first, but we should do it in a wise, proper, and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, our calling can offend people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should set up a proper pattern for them, and then lead them into this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HELPING THE NEW ONES TO PRAY,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>NOT ONLY IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BUT ALSO IN THEIR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to help the new ones to pray, not only in the meetings but also in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, you have to carry out this kind of teaching in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not exercise yourself as a teacher who is teaching them something crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HELPING THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO FOLLOW THE LORD S ANOINTING WITHIN THEM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND THE FLOW OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also have to help the new ones to follow the Lord s anointing within them and the flow of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We still can impart this truth by conversing with them in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can tell them that we Christians all have the Lord within us and that the Lord is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they do not understand the word anointing, we can tell them that this is the same as oiling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a piece of machinery is too dry, we oil it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can tell them that the Lord is within us, and He is always oiling us to make us run so smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may even check with them, Before you called on the name of the Lord, did you ever have this inward feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they say no, then we can say, How about today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may say that they do have a good feeling within them now, and they may also tell you that they feel at times that something within is rebuking them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may say, I have the feeling that a living person is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can tell them that this is very good and that they now have the real experience of a Christian, but we should not teach them too much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>HELPING EVEN THE CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TO CALL, SPEAK, OR SING A HYMN AND</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TO QUOTE OR SPEAK THE WORD OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the home meetings, we need to help even the children to call, speak, or sing a hymn and to quote or speak the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose that you have baptized a couple, and they have a nine-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you go to help them have a home meeting, you must train even the three-year-old girl.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can tell her that it is easy for her to call a hymn in the meeting and that it is even easier to sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may say, You know when you are going to have a home meeting and that some brothers will come to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we come, you can sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you tell the little girl this, she may be singing when you enter the home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take her song as the start of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the little ones like to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may not need to help the little girl sing a whole verse or stanza of a song.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you can help her to sing one line, she may be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The little ones can be a very good help to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You also can help them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They can pray a simple prayer such as, Lord Jesus, You are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I love You and I know that You are with me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can instruct the nine-year-old boy to speak some verses, to read some portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way all the members of the family participate in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do this week after week with this family, they will accumulate many divine riches.</S>
