   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the Lord Jesus is constituting certain members of His Body into the proper gifts to the Body, and He is doing this by the way of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has received gifts in man and in the position of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the fastest way for us to grow is by feeding on the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not by having gifts or Bible knowledge, although it is not my purpose to oppose these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fastest way for Christians to grow is by feeding upon Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we masticate Jesus, the more we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many matured ones among Christians today, but they are not matured in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They may be matured in knowledge, in teaching, or in gifts, but as far as life is concerned, they are babes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of what kind of gifts we have, it is exceedingly easy for us to be carried away and tossed to and fro by the winds of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians today have all of these things, yet they are not stable; it is so easy for them to change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because the proper growth in life is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not think that I am criticizing today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am simply stating the facts of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Luke 24:49, the Lord likened the baptism of the Holy Spirit to a piece of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The disciples were told to wait until they were clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But can anyone grow by being clothed?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all know that clothing is not for growing, but for covering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is lacking today is the proper food for the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gifts cannot feed us, knowledge cannot feed us, and even the best capabilities cannot feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may be able to do many things, but doing cannot feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why many Christians are so poor today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have clothing, knowledge, and capabilities, but they have no food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The food can come only from the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The humanity of Jesus is the main food for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who bear responsibility in a local church should not demand so much from the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, they must labor on the land, produce the grain, make the flour, and prepare the meal offering for the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the remainder will be for all the priests to feed upon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus all the infant priests will grow into useful gifts for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The real need for today's church life is not teachings but the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:15 tells us to hold truth, which means the reality: "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reality is mainly in the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus is the reality, and we must grow up into Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must grow up into the Head in all things in our daily walk by holding the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Christ to receive gifts in man means that we must hold to His humanity in order to enjoy the reality and grow into useful gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we grow we are able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why Ephesians 4:16 says that out from the Head the whole Body is fitted and knit together by the joints of supply according to the operation in measure of every part.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This makes for the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must all look to the Lord that we may see how the standing boards and the uniting bars are produced, as well as how the gifts are constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only way is by feeding on the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is thus that we will grow in life and be constituted as the proper gifts for the building up of the Body.</S>
