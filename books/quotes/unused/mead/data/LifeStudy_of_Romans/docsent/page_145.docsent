   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MINDING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we abide in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:6 points the way: For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the divine Spirit is mingled with our spirit, it is difficult to say whether the spirit in this verse refers to our spirit or to the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit here is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As verse 16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Opposed to this wonderful mingled spirit is the flesh, our corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the body originally created by God there was no sinful element; on the contrary, the human body was pure and sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the fall, however, Satan, the evil one, injected himself as sin into man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This happened when man took into him the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Satan entered into man s body, the body was contaminated and polluted and thereby became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, our spirit is mingled with the Triune God, and our body, which has become the flesh, is mixed with the sinful element of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This makes the Christian a miniature garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the garden man faced the tree of life on the one hand and the tree of knowledge on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, as those who were represented by Adam in Genesis 2, we have the tree of life in our spirit and the tree of knowledge in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to decide whether we shall set our mind on the flesh and suffer death or whether we shall set our mind on the spirit and enjoy life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By setting our mind on the spirit we abide in Christ who as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doctrine, method, nor system can subdue the satanic element in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the whole universe only God is more powerful than Satan; no doctrine can prevail against him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you think you can defeat Satan by sound teachings, by correct methods, or by the knowledge of the Scripture in letters?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How absurd!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord that the very Triune God who is now within us has already conquered Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of following certain methods, we should simply depend upon the Lord constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s word in John 15:5 applies here: Apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We simply need to abide in Him by setting our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have the answers to the three questions we have raised concerning abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the life-giving Spirit who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we abide in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We abide in Him by setting our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The setting of the mind on the spirit actually is the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day and even moment by moment, we need to set our mind, which represents our whole being, on the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is always life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8 surely is a progression from John 15 regarding the abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we did not have Romans 8, we would still be groping to find the practical way to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that we are no longer groping in the darkness searching for the way!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, we have learned from Romans 8 that all we need to do is turn our being to the living One who indwells our spirit and stay one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we turn to Him and set our mind on Him, we have life, peace, light, comfort, strength, and all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our thirst is quenched and our hunger is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT BY PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to set our being on the mingled spirit, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How easily we are distracted from the divine Spirit in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our mind is so quickly drawn to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we need to pray, not mainly to ask the Lord to do things for us, but to keep our mind set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Be assured, the Lord will take care of you and do everything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, in prayer you need not be occupied with your needs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, pray to keep in touch with the living One in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more you keep in contact with Him, the more you will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not pray about your need for love or patience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our experience proves that the more we pray about such things, the more we are distracted from the mingled spirit and the less we abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should simply praise the Lord that He is our love, our patience, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we praise Him in this way, declaring how good the Lord is, spontaneously love and patience will flow out of us, whether we are conscious of it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others will be surprised at the change in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will not see the temporary results of our own efforts, but they will see Christ as the life-giving Spirit being lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we set our mind on the living One in our spirit, the more He lives Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the way to a life of holiness and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us forget systems and methods and instead turn to the living Person within us and set our mind on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is waiting for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the way to abide in Him.</S>
