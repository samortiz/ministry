   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The time of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The place for obtaining the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Patterns of pursuing the reward: Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A comparison between salvation and the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible shows that before God there is the matter not only of salvation but also of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reward serves as a warning, encouraging us to go forward and drawing us to pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, every believer should pay attention to the matter of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we will examine this topic in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DIFFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BETWEEN REWARD AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reward that the Bible speaks of is different from salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If anyone s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward 1 Cor 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse speaks of receiving a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our work upon Christ as the foundation remains, we will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that receiving a reward is not the same as being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation is by faith; it is not according to works Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this verse speaks of a reward that is based upon our work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our work before the Lord is consumed, that is, if it does not remain, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To suffer loss here is not in relation to eternal perdition, and it does not mean that we are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, it means that we will not obtain the reward, but instead we will be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is indicated by the phrase he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire in the second half of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Passing through fire indicates discipline; moreover, this discipline causes one to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our works and acts are not according to God s will, we will be disciplined in the future even though we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, according to the Bible, there is a possibility that we will suffer loss in the future, because the preceding verse shows that the matter of reward is different from the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Corinthians 3 we can clearly see that there is a matter of reward and loss apart from salvation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must not think that we have nothing to fear since we will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although perdition is reserved for unbelievers, it is still possible for believers to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consequently, we should not think that everything is all right as long as we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we have escaped perdition, we will not necessarily escape the suffering of loss.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, although we have obtained salvation, we will not necessarily obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as suffering loss and perishing are different, obtaining the reward and being saved are different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the future some believers will not only be saved but also rewarded; however, some believers will suffer loss despite being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This should be a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>FIVE ASPECTS OF THE REWARD Obtaining a Crown</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Bible, there are at least five different aspects related to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first aspect involves obtaining a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament speaks of the believers being rewarded with five different kinds of crowns in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The crown of righteousness 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a reward the Lord will give a crown to those who faithfully follow Him and love His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This crown is called the crown of righteousness because it is according to the Lord who judges righteously and who will give it to His faithful followers according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, this crown is given to people in order to manifest God s righteousness, unlike salvation, which is given to people in order to manifest God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s salvation manifests God s grace because everyone who believes receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In contrast, only faithful followers will obtain the crown of righteousness since it manifests God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who love the Lord today and pay a great price and suffer for Him, which includes His will and His way, will be rewarded with the crown of righteousness by the Lord according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the future this crown will be a constant announcement of God s righteousness in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The crown of life Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a reward the Lord will give the crown of life to the believers who do not care for their own lives and who are faithful unto death by being martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For the sake of the Lord and His testimony, they do not love themselves to the extent that they willingly give up their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Consequently, the Lord will reward them with the crown of life, causing them to eternally express His powerful resurrection life, which cannot be held down by death and which testifies that they have overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The unfading crown of glory 1 Pet 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a reward the Lord will give an unfading crown of glory to those who are willing to shepherd His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since they are one with the Lord s heart in caring for the flock of God, the Lord will reward them with an unfading crown of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Glory is the expression of God; God expressed is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By caring for the flock of God, they express both God Himself and His heart; therefore, the Lord will give them an unfading crown of glory so that they can eternally express God s glory, that is, express God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible 1 Cor 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a reward the Lord will give an incorruptible crown to those who put away the pleasures of the world and run in His course.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For the sake of running the Lord s course, some will put away all the corruptible, temporary things of the world, which are passing away.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Consequently, He will give them an incorruptible crown so that they can announce to the universe in eternity that they chose an everlasting and glorious blessing today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Joy or crown ; Joy and crown 1 Thes 2:19; Phil 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As a reward the Lord will give a crown of joy to those who have cared for the spiritual condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today there are some who care for the spirit and condition of others on behalf of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Consequently, those whom they have cared for will become their joy and crown as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Believers have two kinds of joy: the joy of their own salvation and the joy of leading others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some receive only the first kind of joy but never obtain the second.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are saved themselves, but they do not bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They care about their own spirituality but do not care for the condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They are solitary and lonely Christians, because they have no spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thus, they do not have the second kind of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some believers, however, bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They constantly care for and are concerned for others, and their spiritual children become their joy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These spiritual children not only are their joy today, but they also will be their joy and crown in the future, testifying to the universe of their labor on others for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Being Enthroned</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The second aspect of the reward is to be enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord Himself promised this in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Sit on twelve thrones Matt 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord promised that He would reward the twelve disciples, who left everything in order to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Since they left everything for the Lord, the Lord will reward them with thrones to sit on when He rules from His glorious throne, and they will share in His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This reveals a principle that if we leave everything to follow the Lord today, we will be rewarded with a throne by the Lord in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To sit with Me on My throne Rev 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All the overcoming believers will receive the reward of sitting with the Lord on His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is a great honor bestowed by the Lord Himself!</S>
