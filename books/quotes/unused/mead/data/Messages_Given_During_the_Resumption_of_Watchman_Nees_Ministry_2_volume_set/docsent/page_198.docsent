   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It Being a Shame to Have Selective Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In contacting others, one has to watch out if his standing changes with the acquaintance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a shameful thing to have selective fellowship among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Learning to Listen to Others 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Listening to Others Being a Basic</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Qualification of the Workers</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is to learn to listen to others when they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic requirement, technique, or qualification of a worker is that he can listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to be able to sit down for an hour and listen to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the brothers speak, you have to be able to understand sentence by sentence what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only do you have to hear what they are saying; you have to be able to understand what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being Quiet Within,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Not Having One's Own Words</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While the brothers and sisters are speaking, that is the time that you have to remain quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You cannot be saying something else within you at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people hear the wrong things because, while they are listening, they are at the same time speaking within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like having two radios turned on at the same time at home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When two different stations are speaking at the same time, one cannot hear clearly what either one says.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he himself is also speaking while they are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Touching Others' Spirit with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is another point concerning listening.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man's spirit is revealed through his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a man speaks, his spirit is released, and it touches the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man's spirit is released through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you cannot listen to others, you will not be able to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether or not he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to find one in a thousand who can detect others' spirit without listening to their words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other kind of condition, it is expressed through his words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to be an objective person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only an objective person can listen to others speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the greatest need in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Learning to Speak Accurately 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not Speaking Carelessly or Loosely,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not Being Double-tongued</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fourth thing is that a worker has to learn to speak accurately at home in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A careless person has no hope as far as participating in God's work is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A double-tongued person cannot help anyone in any church; he can only cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some brothers have asked me how they should study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can tell you that only an accurate man can study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people by nature cannot study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if you were to send such a one to the seminary, it would still be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He may be able to study philosophy, but he can never study science.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Science is accurate, and every bit of knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Lord's work, there is no such thing as "more or less the same."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Either things are the same, or they are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, the whiteness of snow is different from the whiteness of a white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the careless ones will say that they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not Speaking from Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sisters should pay particular attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In their daily life they should be careful; they should speak properly, sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The careless ones, those who are active in their mind and who have a hard time differentiating between the real and the false things, are of little use in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we want to be accurate in our speaking, the more troublesome it is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is easy to be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But a careless person can only speak from his feeling; he cannot speak accurate words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, truth is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It cannot change according to your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Truth is not affected by anything.</S>
