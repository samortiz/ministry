   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BAPTIZED INTO TERMINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By baptism, we have been put into the Triune God, but this putting in also includes the termination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to read Romans 6 again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death Rom 6:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were baptized into His death, and we have seen that His death means termination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So to be baptized into Christ means to be baptized into termination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we were baptized into Christ, we were terminated in Him and buried in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are happy to hear that we were baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body, but we must realize what baptism means.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Baptism means termination and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be baptized into Christ is to be terminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are even buried in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So many people think that to be put into Christ means to be put into the heavens, but it really means to be put into a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Galatians 2:20 says, No more I. The I is terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not so pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like to stay in Christ, but we do not like to stay in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we take Christ, surely we must also take His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And His death means termination and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>INTO THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nearly all Christians know that Matthew is a book concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this book also shows us that to enter into the kingdom is really simple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We only have to be buried into Christ, and then we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would be buried in Christ, we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To go and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the Triune God means to put people into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And to put people into the kingdom means to terminate them and bury them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, the real meaning of baptism has been completely lost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People only know the form as a kind of ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They simply cannot understand that baptism means to be put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And it means to be terminated and buried in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All my history, my natural life, my self, my nature, and my whole being is now terminated in Christ and is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this I am in the Triune God, I am in Christ, I am in the one Body, and I am in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no other way but to be buried into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not simply to be buried in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That means little.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to be buried into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to put these four verses together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Matthew 28:19 says that we have been baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 say that we have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we have been baptized into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God is the very Christ, and the very Christ is the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are buried into these three things, which are really one, we are really terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we are in the proper church life, the kingdom, and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE PROPER MEANING OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If God did not become the life-giving Spirit, it would be really difficult for Him to put people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the first place, we would still have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sin would not be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Besides this, we are mere human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How could human beings be put into God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But, praise the Lord that He became flesh to accomplish redemption and take away the sin of man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this, He became the life-giving Spirit, making it possible for His chosen ones to be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So when we are baptizing others, we should not do it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must do it with Him, by being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We put them into the water, but He is putting them into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, He is the Baptizer, and on the other hand, He is the available Spirit, making it possible for Him to put people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would know the indwelling of Christ, we must see the proper meaning of the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have been baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And this baptism means our termination and our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have been fully ended.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the Americans are fully ended, and all the Chinese are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the natural human beings have been terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now it is no more I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have been terminated and buried into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we are clear concerning the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Matthew tells us that Christ was a little child, born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And this little child was Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After living on this earth He was processed through death and resurrection to become the wonderful life-giving Spirit, who is the full realization, reality, and embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is the Baptizer, and He is also the very One into whom people are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the baptism that forms the one Body, and this Body today is just Christ, and Christ is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Praise the Lord!</S>
