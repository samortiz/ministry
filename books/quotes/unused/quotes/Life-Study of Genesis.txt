Praise the Lord that He has afforded us this opportunity to have a life-study of His divine Word with such a large congregation!
It took 1600 years to complete, starting with Moses, the greatest prophet of God, and ending with the Apostle John
We thank the Lord that during the past five centuries He has opened up His Word again and again through many great teachers
How we thank the Lord that today the Bible is so open to us, allowing us to have a rich life-study of the living Word
It is not simply words in black and white; it is something higher, deeper, fuller, and richer that is the Spirit and life
The whole Bible is a book of life and this life is nothing less than the divine and living Person of Christ Jesus Himself Who is our portion
If man had eaten the tree of life he would have received the divine life of God that was indicated by the tree of life
After the new birth, the Word of the Bible is milk and food to us that we may be nourished to grow in the Lord
The Old Testament is mainly a prediction of Christ, predicting the coming Christ in plain words, shadows, types, and many figures
Chapters 1 and 2 are the first section, chapters 3 through 11 the second section, and chapters 12 through 50 the third section
In the book of Genesis are two fathers: Adam, the father of the created race, and Abraham, the father of the called race
Christ is the hope and salvation of fallen man, and God will make fallen man to fulfill His purpose through Christ
It mentions that God created the universe, and that the universe was ruined, becoming waste, empty, and full of darkness
Came the animal life in the water, the animal life in the air, and the animal life on the earth, and, eventually, the human life
If we read Genesis carefully once again, we may be surprised that these biographies say very little about the works of these men
If we were to write Adam's biography, we would need hundreds of pages to tell about his work and all that he did
Many things from the heavens are for the earth: the sunshine, the water, and the expanse are all for the earth
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man
The Bible clearly tells us that God created the heavens and the earth by Christ as the Son of God and as the Word of God
The Bible says that when God created the heavens and the earth and all the other items He did it through Christ and by Christ
Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ holds all things by the word of His power, and Colossians 1:17 says that all things subsist in Christ
In the Bible this phrase, 'in the beginning,' is used in two ways, the first time in Genesis 1:1 and the second time in John 1:1
It is quite interesting to notice that in this sentence the subject 'God' is plural and the predicate 'created' is singular
In Genesis 1 and 2, three different verbs are used concerning God's creation and re-creation: created, made, and formed
Although God's divine power and Godhead are invisible things, man can understand them by the things that were made
They were taught that these two chapters are a record of God's creation, and that chapter 1, verse 1 is the subject
The book of Job tells us that when God laid the measure of the foundation of the earth, the sons of God shouted for joy
From Ezekiel 28 we see that Satan was not only one of the angels, but the highest archangel, the head of all the angels
Satan, the Devil, told the Lord that all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory had been delivered to him
Also the four living creatures in Ezekiel are similar to the four in Revelation which took the lead among the creatures in worshipping God
In Exodus 24:10, 17, Moses, Aaron, and many others saw under God's throne some precious stones with the glory of God like burning fire
From this we may infer that the anointed cherub was also specially privileged to move in the realm where God's glory was
He had not only the kingship, but also the priesthood, the very position that we, God's redeemed people, have forever
Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan's position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God
Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness
The Apostle would never allow a novice to be an elder in the church lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil
All the natural virtues and attributes, and all the spiritual gifts can be utilized by the Devil to make us proud
In Revelation 12:4, 9 we see that one-third of the heavenly stars, that is one-third of the angels, followed him
When Satan rebelled against God, most of his angels followed him in his rebellion, becoming the fallen angels, the evil spirits
The living creatures which were on the earth at that time, and later became the demons on the earth, also joined Satan in his rebellion
In this portion of the Word, we can see that Satan has his devilish kingdom and that he is 'the ruler of the demons'
Verse 43 says, 'When the unclean spirit goes out from a man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it'
The demon that was cast out of the blind and dumb man was seeking rest which he could not find in the waterless places
After studying this matter thoroughly, Pember inferred that at a certain time after the original creation, Satan and his angels rebelled
As the children of God, we should know something of these points concerning the universe and, especially, the earth
In Satan's kingdom there are the fallen angels in the air, the demons in the water, and the fallen human beings on the earth
When the morning stars saw it, they were excited and sang, and when all the angels saw it, they shouted for joy
Whenever these two words 'waste' and 'empty' are used together in the Old Testament, they always denote a result of judgment
The word 'became' is the same word as used in Genesis 19:26 which says that Lot's wife 'became a pillar of salt'
God judged Satan and his followers before Adam was created, but the execution of this judgment is still going on
Through the church's executing work, the Devil will be 'cast to the earth,' and his angels will be 'cast out with him'
Genesis 1:2b 2:25 is a portion of the divine Word showing us God's restoration of the damaged universe, plus His further creation
These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens
If we read the first chapter of Genesis carefully and have light from the Holy Spirit we can realize that it is absolutely a chapter of life
In the midst of this death condition, the Bible suddenly says, 'And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters'
We need to see that the record of Genesis 1 is something related to life, to God's gospel, and to spiritual things
By this one verse, we can realize that everything recorded in Genesis 1 must be related to life, to God's shining, and to God's gospel
In this abyss was a swarm of demons, driving us to lose our temper, to gamble, to go to the movies, and to do many other evil things
One day, some living One began to hover over us, to work within our heart, to brood upon the death and the deep within us
The Lord Jesus said that when the Holy Spirit is come He will reprove He will convince the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment
He has passed through incarnation, He has passed through life on this earth, He has passed through crucifixion and resurrection
The Spirit came to brood over the waters of death which submerged the earth, brooding that life might be generated
Now we come to the third requirement for generating life: the light came to dispel the darkness that covered the waters of death
We should remember the three comings: the coming of the Spirit, the coming of the Word, and the coming of Light
Immediately after you were saved, you didn't have any discernment and were unable to distinguish between light and darkness
In Genesis 1:5, it doesn't say morning and evening; it says evening and morning because we came out of the night
The waters under the expanse represent the earthly things, while the waters above the expanse represent heavenly things
Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the living Word can separate us to such an extent that our soul is divided from our spirit
We need a further division: not only a separation between light and darkness, but also a discernment between the spirit and the soul
Have you ever noticed in Genesis 1 that on every day except the second after God had accomplished something He looked at it and it was good
On the second day, there was something which really was not good: in the air were the fallen angels and in the waters were the demons
The Bible tells us that, eventually, after God has worked through many generations, the sea will be eliminated
As you are going on with the Lord, the waters of death within you will gradually be confined, limited, and eliminated
As we grow in the Lord we learn how to discern light from darkness separate heavenly things from earthly things and divide life from death
My speaking is genuine and proper, with nothing of darkness and nothing worldly, but nevertheless is full of death
By these three separations the dry land emerged out of the waters of death on the third day, the day of resurrection
The land was recovered until the day of Babel when man fell even further and the whole human race rose up in rebellion against God
Although last week you might have been like the grass, today you have grown a little higher and you have become the herb yielding the seed
Today you may be an herb, but after a certain period of time perhaps you will be likened to a fruit-bearing tree
Genesis 1:14-19 does not speak about lights in a loose way, but in a very definite way the sun, the moon, and the stars
Based upon this fact, we may say that the church as the wife, the bride of Christ, may be typified by the moon
We not only have the sun, the moon, but also the stars: not only Christ, the church, but also all the overcoming saints
Revelation 1:20 tells us that the churches are the lampstands shining in the darkness and that the angels are the shining stars
The Lord said that the saints are 'the light of the world' , and Paul said that the saints shine 'as lights in the world'
After we have grown in life from the grass to the tree, we should not be satisfied, for that was only the third day, not the end
The lights God made on the fourth day were established 'to rule over the day and over the night' by their shining
Although every form of animal life has some level of consciousness, some lives are higher and others are lower
Today, if you are so living and one of your schoolmates tempts you to go to a movie or to take some drugs, you will say, 'No'
Also, we have Isaiah 40:31 which says that they who wait on the Lord shall be as the eagles, soaring and transcending
We can live in any kind of situation, but with a little more growth we not only survive in evil circumstances, we also transcend them
Their consciousness is higher than the fish, even higher than the bird, and they can do something on this earth
Starting from the level of the grass, this life will grow from the grass to the herb, from the herb to the tree
The light on the first day is for the generating of life; the lights on the fourth day are for the growth of life
If you are a tree or an herb, you will certainly be killed, but if you have grown from a plant to a fish, you will live
They realized that they needed to stay on earth to produce some milk for their folks and to bear their dear folks as a burden
While your wife is arguing with you, you put her upon your shoulders and tell her, 'I am going to bear you to the heavens'
Whenever someone persecuted Him, He put that persecutor on His shoulders and said, 'I will carry you to the heavens'
You will be able to withstand any death situation and be able to transcend every opposition, distraction, or temptation
Before we study the creation of man, we need to consider, as a parenthesis, the matter of the fourth-day lights
The Bible does not tell us what kind of light was present on the first day, and there is no need for us to guess
If we pay attention to the record of Genesis 1, we can see that God's restoration with His further creation was accomplished in six days
After creation, there was a great change which occurred somewhere in chapter 1, verse 2, and God came in to judge the universe
God limited the darkness on the first day and, in the same principle, He limited the death waters on the third day
After the first day of God's restoring creation, it was half light and half darkness; after the third day, it was half land and half water
In the new heavens and the new earth, there will be no more sea ; in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more night
According to the principle of life, the fourth-day lights are not for generating life; they are for the growth of life
That was the lowest life, the life with the lowest consciousness, unable to walk, unable to talk, and unable to understand God
God may speak to a lily a thousand times, but the lily cannot respond to Him because the life of a lily is too low
If today, during the church age, you are going to have the light of the seven Spirits, you must have the churches
During the church age it is night, and during the night we cannot get the sunlight, the light of Christ, directly
As many can testify, whenever we were bothered by the church and turned our backs to the church, we were in absolute darkness
The more church life we have, the more Christ we gain, the more light we receive, and the more growth in life we experience
Matthew 514 says that the believers today are the light of the world and Philippians 215 says among whom you shine as lights in the world
The disciples also came to the Lord on the mount of Olives and asked Him about the sign of His coming, the sign of the end of this age
Strictly speaking, she began in Genesis 2 with Eve, not in Genesis 3, and then proceeds from Genesis 2 to Revelation 22
At the time of the feast, the people of Israel brought their riches cows, lambs, grapes, all the produce which came from the growth
When we were saved, that was also the beginning of a new year, the year of our rebirth, a real revolution in our life
Exodus 40:2, 17 tells us that the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month, another new start
Why didnt God tell the people to raise up the tabernacle on the twentyninth day of the fourth month but on the first day of the first month
Chronicles 29:17 and Ezekiel 45:18 both tell us that the people cleansed and sanctified the temple on the first day of the first month
All of these are new beginnings in your Christian life for your growth in Christ and they must be on the first day of the first month
Christ is the holy day, Christ is the new moon, Christ is the sabbath day, Christ is the beginning of the year, Christ is everything
In that city there will be no need for the sun or the moon or any lamp because the Triune God will be the light
In this message we will consider the creation of the human life, the higher life with the highest consciousness
Since the last message was a parenthesis, we now continue our study with the process of God's restoration and further creation
To accomplish this work, there is the need of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to work on man
In the early part of the sixth day God created the cattle represented by the ox the beasts represented by the lion and the creeping things
You are very high, higher than the grass, higher than the herbs and the trees, higher than the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things
The trees are larger, bearing fruit as well as seeds; yet, none of them has a face with which to express itself
Regardless of how much the faces of birds, cattle, beasts, eagles, oxen, and lambs resemble the face of man, they are not man
The human life is the maturity of all created life, having the ability to express God and to exercise God's dominion
Man has been created, possessing a life with the highest consciousness, a life that is able to express God and represent God
We have the birds in the air, the fish in the water, and the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things on the earth
As long as the earth was under the death waters, there was no possibility to generate life or to have dominion
He recovered the earth, created man, and produced all kinds of life for the purpose of expressing Himself and dealing with His enemy
God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself
All of the good Bible students agree that the image refers to something inward and the likeness refers to something outward
Since man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created in the image of Christ
As a photograph is the expression of a certain image, so man was made to be the expression of the image of God which is Christ
Man was made according to Christ and Christ was made in the likeness of man that through His death and resurrection man may obtain Gods life
We cannot deny that the thumb of a glove is a thumb, but compared with the real thumb we find a great difference
By all of these instances, we can see that the Lord Jesus, before His incarnation, appeared several times in the bodyform of a man
Regardless of how much man had the form and the image of God, he did not have the reality of God or the life of God
It is so important, so central and crucial that we all see the image of God and the form of God in which and after which we were created
We must all see how Christ was this image and how Christ was made in the form of man that we may take Him in as our life and reality
In Ezekiel and Revelation, there is no mention of the grass, the herb, the trees, the fish, or the creeping things
We all must grow until we reach the higher plane of life, that is the plane of the cattle, the lion, and the eagle
We must grow and grow and grow from the plant life to the animal life and from the animal life to the human life
As we have seen, Genesis 1 says something about the light and this light has been developed through the whole Bible
In my opinion, the ox in Ezekiel should be a calf, and the calf in Revelation should be an ox first the younger, then the older
The reason is that the order of the living creatures in Revelation is according to the order of the four Gospels
In the conference we had on Ezekiel, we covered Ezekiel 1 and saw how the four living creatures were the manifestation of God's glory
In this universe there are four living creatures, representing all kinds of life on every plane, to express Christ
Out of nine categories, only four the bird, the cattle, the beast, and the man are qualified to express Christ
Because, the human life within you is much more distinctive than the bird life, the cattle life, and the beast life
Although we need the human life to express Christ, we still need the calf life, the lion life, and the eagle life
The young people especially need to lay hold of these two words with these two basic revelations: image and dominion
The first aspect of God's intention is to deal with His enemy, to deal with Satan typified by the creeping things
He created man in His own image that man might express Him and He gave him dominion that man might deal with His enemy
We all must realize that today God has this double goal to accomplish to express Himself and to deal with His enemy
The only way to deal with Satan is to go on our knees, pray, call on the name of Jesus, and ask Him to bind the serpent
There is no doubt that the Lord's name is excellent in the heavens, but, in a sense, the name of the Lord is not excellent on this earth
We must pray, 'Let Your name be sanctified; let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth'
God's habitation will be the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem will come down from the heavens to the new earth
The third aspect of God's intention in giving man dominion is to bring in God's authority, to exercise God's authority over the earth
Neither will He be happy to have His will done only in the heavens nor to see His glory expressed only in the heavens
The Bible tells us that immediately after the creation of man, Satan came in to damage the man whom God had created for His purpose
According to their concept, when the Jewish people rejected Jesus with the kingdom, the kingdom was suspended and the church age began
They think that the church is not the kingdom, that after the church age the kingdom will be established by the return of Jesus
As a man named Jesus of Nazareth, He was commissioned with all authority in heaven and on earth after His resurrection
The fulfillment of God's intention in giving man dominion involves Christ as the Head and the church, including all the saints, as the Body
At that time, Satan, the evil angels in the air, and the sea with all the demons will be cast into the lake of fire
We go from the single word dominion in Genesis 1 to Revelation 22:5 where we see that all the saints will reign with God for eternity
Man was made in God's image to express God and was given God's dominion to represent God and to deal with His enemy
Man was committed with God's dominion over the seas, the air, the earth, and especially over all the creeping things
The climax in God's creation is man bearing God's image and representing God with His authority over all things
Whenever the wife looks at him, she will realize that his words are weighty, that there is something precious and valuable about him
When the Lord Jesus came, He never held any attitude toward people that He was the authority and that people had to submit to Him
To build an altar for the purpose of contacting God means to become more and more transformed into the image of God
The Bible tells us that eventually God became a friend to Abraham and that Abraham was called the friend of God
The story of Joseph is the story of a holy and victorious life, a life that eventually became the ruling authority
In the last few chapters of Genesis, we also see a man who really expressed God, represented God, and ruled over the whole earth
The priesthood is for us to contact God and to have the image of God the kingship is for us to represent God and to exercise Gods authority
If you read Joshua 6 again, you will see that the whole nation of Israel did not fight the battle with swords or spears
At a certain time, the people of Israel murmured and rebelled against Aaron, saying, 'Is God only with you and not with us'?
Whether or not this dead wood can be a rod of authority depends on whether or not this dead wood buds with resurrection life
If you have the intention to be a leader in a certain service, we will wait to see whether or not the dead wood rots or buds
In other words, whenever the kings were in the image of God and expressed God, they had authority to defeat the enemies
Now we are priests to be like God and, at the same time, we are kings to represent God, exercising His authority over the enemies
During the millennium, the coming kingdom age of a thousand years, the overcoming saints will be priests and kings
In eternity the whole body of the redeemed saints will bear God's image to express God and exercise God's authority to represent God
Let us turn to the book of Matthew and read the last verse of chapter sixteen and the first two verses of chapter seventeen
After six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart
If you study the context of 2 Corinthians 3, you will see that the veil mentioned there is specifically the Old Testament in letters
That philosophy, the highest product of human culture, came into the early church, causing considerable frustration
Although philosophy may be good and the best product of human culture, since it is not the Lord it becomes a veil
Hebrews shows us that all the good things in Judaism should just be considered as types, figures, and shadows of Christ
Before Jesus came, God used the Old Testament to present to His people many pictures of Christ from different angles
The Jewish people just held on to the pictures, not only pictures in four directions, but maybe in thirty-two directions
As we have seen in the previous message, the first item of this consummation was God expressed and represented
Before the time that God had a man to express Him and represent Him, there was no way for God to pour out His full blessing
God is rich and God is rich in blessing, but before the creation of man there was no object to receive His blessing in full
According to the record of Genesis 1, God did not begin to bless until the time when the living creatures came into being
After God created man, He was able to see on earth a living creature bearing His image and having His dominion
If there is the image of God with God's dominion in your home, you can be assured that the blessing of God will be there
As long as we exercise the priesthood to contact God, to behold God and to reflect the image of glory, we have the kingship
If we express Him and represent Him in an adequate way, we will surely have His full blessing in multiplication and fruit bearing
Everything in the Christian field, including gospel preaching, has been damaged by the poor practice of the past centuries
In Matthew Mark and Luke the Lord Jesus said to go preach the gospel and disciple the nations but in John He said that we must bear fruit
Genuine gospel preaching is not to convince people doctrinally, to subdue their thinking, and change their concept
We must realize that gospel preaching should be fruit bearing and that fruit bearing comes from God's blessing
If the preaching of the gospel is not under God's blessing, nothing will be gained regardless of how much we endeavor
You may bring in many people, but when God looks at them He will say, 'This is a scorpion, that is a serpent, and that is a frog
If we are in the image of God and if we have the dominion of God, we will surely bring others into the image of God and dominion of God
All the local churches need the increase, but never use gimmicks, which may produce 'Moabites' instead of the proper fruit
We quote the record in Acts where it says that 3,000 were saved on the day of Pentecost and 5,000 saved on another day
The reason for God's rest was that His glory was manifested because man had His image and His authority was about to be exercised
It was not simply that God had finished His work, but in His work was a man who could bear God's image and subdue God's enemy
If you buy something that will not help you to express God and to deal with Satan, you will lose the foretaste of rest
If you express God and deal with His enemy in whatever you do and wherever you go, you will have a sweet foretaste of the coming rest
Two people were on the phone, the one confirming what the other said about the poor and sick condition of the church
According to Hebrews, there is a rest promised for God's people, and we all must labor to enter into that rest
The consummate rest mainly includes two items: the expression of God's image and the exercise of God's authority
As long as you have God's image expressed and God's dominion exercised to deal with His enemy, God has reached His goal
All the aforementioned rests are due to the fact that God has reached His goal and man enjoys the rest with God
The biographies of the eight men Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph will present the full picture
At the end of Genesis, we will see a dual man: one aspect Jacob expressing God's image and the other aspect Joseph exercising God's dominion
Without the New Testament, it would be difficult for us to understand the allegories, types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament
We have the pictures and we have the clear words that we may know where we are in God's image and God's dominion
We need to remember the five crucial words that we have covered thus far image, dominion, blessing, satisfaction, and rest
In the previous messages we have covered the first main point of the book of Genesis the desire and purpose of God
God's desire and purpose are to have a corporate man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His authority
Although the record of creation in Genesis 1 reveals God's purpose in creating man, it does not show us the way to fulfill this purpose
If we read this portion of the Word in the light of the whole Bible, we will see that this procedure is of three steps
Before we consider the first step, we want to point out that the means by which God fulfills His purpose is life
Even in the area of human relationships we find it true that the more life a person has the more authority he has
If you are to represent a certain person in society, you need to possess a life that is nearly the same as his
To a certain extent, a woman is not even qualified in life to represent her husband, because her life is not as high as her husband's
Not only is our fallen life inadequate for this, but even the created life we had at the beginning was inadequate
Although the picture reveals the features, style, and the person of Brother John, it does not have the life of Brother John
Man was created in the image of God, but he was like a photograph showing something of God without having the life of God
There is no other way for us to express God in His image and to represent God with His authority except by sharing His life
During the night, Aaron's rod budded, signifying that resurrection life had authorized his rod to reign over the people
Revelation 20:4 says that it is the overcoming resurrection life which brings believers into the reign with Christ during the millennium
If we are in the water of life, it will bring us to the throne of God, giving us the authority that proceeds from His throne
The first step of God's procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to create man as a vessel to contain Himself as life
It was presented initially in Genesis and then stated emphatically by Paul in Romans 9 when he said, 'Who are you, trying to argue with God?
Earlier in verse 5 it mentions 'every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew'
If you do the same thing with some lines from the Los Angeles Times or the Santa Anna Register you will be killed
We must realize that allegorizing the Bible is proper because much of it, especially Genesis 1 and 2, is written in figurative language
He said that He was Solomon, David, the sabbath, the light, the food, the air, the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture
Now we are going to allegorize Genesis 2:5-6 where we are told that God did not cause rain to come on the earth
When the rain descends to the earth, it soaks into the ground and mingles with it for the purpose of producing life
Suppose there is no man upon the earth claiming the rain and some angel says, 'O God Jehovah, why don't You send the rain'?
The style of American cars may be improved and changed every year, but no one can improve the design of a human being
In Ecclesiastes 12:3 Solomon mentions the grinders, saying that when a man is old the grinders will cease because they are few
When we eat a piece of meat, our front teeth cut it, and the tongue sends it to the molars where it is ground into a digestible substance
Even medical science can confirm that the human body contains all the elements found in dust such as salt, sulfur, copper, and iron
Our body is an outward container and within us is a spirit made by God as a receiver to receive God as the heavenly radio waves
Although we have such a lamp within us, we need the divine oil to come into it, enabling the lamp to burn and shine
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
We praise the Lord that the heavens serve the earth, the earth serves man, and man has a spirit to receive God
God made man a living soul that man may have a soul as his person with his personality and as an organ to contact the psychological realm
Although you can afford every amusement, as you sit alone in your home at night you have the sense that deep within you are empty
We have three kinds of needs material needs, psychological needs, and spiritual needs because we have three parts to our being
Although you may have the finest material enjoyment and the best psychological satisfaction, you are still short
God's intention was that man, as a complete, created being, might take God as life and express Him in all his personality
As we have pointed out formerly, everything in Genesis is a seed that will be developed in the following books of the Bible
All of these points are sown in Genesis as seeds and will be fully developed in the New Testament as a harvest
We need many verses from the New Testament to give a comprehensive definition of these matters, but for the time being we must stop here
Romans 9 declares definitely that God made man out of clay as vessels of mercy unto honor and glory to contain God Himself
In this universe three things are necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man
Our spirit is extremely important; it is just as vital for the accomplishment of God's purpose as are the heavens and the earth
Although the spirit of man is not spacious as the heavens or large as the earth, it is nevertheless the most crucial aspect of our being
Consider the organs of our physical body: we have hearing organs, seeing organs, smelling, tasting, and touching organs
Although it is difficult to understand our spirit, we can know something about it through the function of our conscience
Even if he should ignore the feeling of his conscience and steal something, the voice of his conscience will condemn him for many days
If we try to experience God without exercising our spirit, it will be like attempting to substantiate colors without exercising our sight
The stomach is not only a receiver but also a digestive organ which assimilates food and dispenses it into the blood cells
Within our spirit we contain Him and, in a sense, we assimilate Him and dispense His divine elements into our whole being
As human beings, we were made by God in a very specific manner: we were made as vessels with a receiver, our human spirit
As we read Genesis 2, we must realize that this record is written in figurative language and that these figures need to be allegorized
In the Bible 'eastward' signifies the direction of shining glory because the rising of the glorious sunshine occurs in the east
Whenever we come together and have the presence of the Lord, we immediately sense deep within that this meeting is glorious
Whether man shall have life or shall die, shall live everlastingly or shall perish, all depends on how man deals with the tree
The fact that the Lord God made every tree which is pleasant to the sight means that God wanted to please man and to make him happy
Jesus said that He is the bread of life, meaning that He has come to us as the tree of life in the form of food
For man to receive God as life to enjoy the fatness of God to quench thirst to be watered to grow and to rejoice all depends on the river
Although Genesis 2 appears to be a record of creation, it was actually written according to the experience of life
In Revelation 22:1-2 we see that the river of life with the tree of life growing in it proceeds out of the throne of God
Whenever we take God in Christ as our life, we will have this river flowing within us to water us and work many things within us
Although the believers here may number a thousand, we still have one river because we all are of the same source God the Creator
Because men live in each of the four directions, the one river flows out of God in every direction to reach them
If you have had no experience, you will not understand what this means; if you have had some experience you will say, 'Amen'
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul warns us to be careful about our building work, telling us to use the proper materials, the first of which is gold
At present, we do not have time to cover the definition of pearl except to say that it is a transformed substance
The flowing of the river brings forth onyx stone, which typifies the transformed man expressing God's glorious image
If we read through the entire Bible, we will see that these materials are all found in the building of the New Jerusalem
Cush, the ancient Hebrew name for Ethiopia, means black face, typifying the unchangeable evil nature of sinners
Praise the Lord that the turbulence of the divine waters will regenerate us and transform us into another person
By this flow we will become gold, pearl, and precious stones for the building of God's habitation, the New Jerusalem
Paul says that we must take heed how we build the church, that we should build with gold, silver, and precious stones
In the previous messages we have seen the eternal purpose of God, which is to express Himself and to exercise His dominion through man
For the fulfillment of this purpose, God created man in a specific way as a vessel to contain God Himself as life
God created man with a human spirit that he might contact God, receive God, retain God, and assimilate God into his whole being
Near the tree of life was a river flowing with living water, and at the flow of this river were gold, pearl, and onyx stones
We must learn why God used nearly a whole chapter to portray a garden, a tree, a man, a river, and three precious materials
The Bible as a whole is God's revelation, and most of the seeds of this revelation were sown in Genesis 1 and 2
At the time of harvest in Revelation, the materials are no longer in a natural state, but become a building fitly joined together
The precious stones are built into the wall of the New Jerusalem, and every gate in this wall is a large pearl
The site of the New Jerusalem is gold, the wall is composed of precious stones, and each of the twelve gates is a pearl
Whenever he went into the presence of God on behalf of the people, he had to wear two shoulder plates and a breastplate
On the shoulder plates were two large pieces of onyx stone on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
In the eyes of God, the breastplate of the high priest was a part of the miniature of the coming New Jerusalem
Psalm 36:8-9 tells us that the children of Israel enjoyed the fountain of life and the river of pleasures in God
In the garden of Genesis 2 there was no sin, and for eternity in the New Jerusalem of Revelation 21 sin will be banished
Silver stands for redemption between Genesis 2 and Revelation 21 because of the great problem of sin that necessitates redemption
Unlike gold, pearl, and precious stones are transformed materials, for they have been changed from one form into another
When you pray to God the Father or call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the divine life flows within you to bring forth gold
Suppose you intend to go shopping after a two-hour period of prayer, and the inner sense of the divine gold does not agree
Although pearl is replaced with silver in 1 Corinthians because of the need for redemption, pearl was God's original concept
Originally, we were small pieces of sand, but we became pearls as the life juice of Christ enveloped our being
Although we may have the gate of pearl and the street of gold, we do not yet have a wall built up to express the image of God
The wall of the New Jerusalem and the first foundation stone of the wall are also built with jasper , bearing the same appearance as God
After entering the gate of pearl and walking the street of gold, you may think you are right with the Lord in every respect
We need a great amount of pressure and burning and flowing of life before we can be transformed into precious stones
Most of the work among Christians is not with gold, silver or pearl, and precious stone, but with wood, grass, and straw
Our humanity must be a resurrected humanity, for the natural humanity is inadequate for the building of God's church
We should not be wood or straw, materials that will be burned away and that are useless for the building of God's church
In the foregoing messages, we have covered God's eternal purpose and some of the points regarding God's way of fulfilling His purpose
In other words, Satan told the Lord that He was bribing Job to worship Him and that if He did not bribe him, Job would forsake Him
The Lord God stayed away, allowing His people to make a choice, that the actual situation might be proved to His enemy
Our brother Watchman Nee was imprisoned for twenty years, from 1952 until his death in 1972, where he was tested and tempted
The same principle operated in the garden of Eden when God placed Adam before the two trees, which denoted two sources
Nearly everyone reading this message has graduated from some kind of school, either elementary school, high school, college, or university
Man had forsaken the presence of God and was living absolutely according to knowledge, not according to God as life
God did not give Abraham a map or directions, because His intention was that Abraham had to live and move continually in His presence
The Lord could be in the third heavens and you in a remote region of the earth and you could still conduct your ministry
Remember how the Jewish religionists, the Pharisees and the scribes, used the Bible to condemn the Lord Jesus to death
If the elder gives such a reply, he will certainly be an elder of knowledge, not knowing the principle of life
The tree of knowledge firstly signifies everything utilized by Satan, regardless of whether it is good or evil
At the beginning of the Bible, the serpent was very cunning and apparently was quite attractive , unlike the ugly serpents under God's curse
When the Lord spoke of His coming crucifixion, Peter said, 'God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You'!
Even the Bible inspired by God and the law given by God may be utilized in letters by Satan as the tree of knowledge
Two months ago that message was the tree of life; now, once it is repeated in the way of knowledge, it becomes the tree of knowledge
Because that prayer was excellent and living, you decide to repeat the same prayer, word for word, in the next prayer meeting
To merely search the Scriptures is to come to the tree of knowledge; to contact the Lord through the Word is to come to the tree of life
The principle of the tree of life and the principle of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are realized throughout the whole Bible
According to Genesis 4, the first human culture was invented, and this culture developed until it became the corrupted world of Noah
Not long afterward, the church was degraded, falling from the living Christ to dead scriptural knowledge, and became Christianity
The overcomers among the Christians through all the centuries never have shifted from the line of life to the line of knowledge
The great Babylon and all things apart from God will be swept away by the stream of fire into the lake of fire
All the positive things in the Bible throughout the ages will be carried on by the river of the water of life into the New Jerusalem
At the end of the book of Revelation we find the harvest of the seed of the tree of knowledge and of the tree of life
If you answer one question, they respond with several more because there is a craving for knowledge within man
Although the word 'knowledge' itself may be a good term, at the back of knowledge and underneath knowledge is death
The difference is in the appearance, not in the actuality, for death is present and prevailing in both good and evil things
The Samaritan woman asked the Lord concerning the proper place of worship, whether it was in the mountain of Samaria or in Jerusalem
The Lord said that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him, not in a certain correct place, but in our spirit
The disciples under the influence of a natural religious concept asked Him Who sinned this man or his parents that he should be born blind
When Nicodemus approached the Lord in the way of religious teachings, the Lord answered that he needed a rebirth with the divine life
It was not a matter of teaching, of knowledge added to the mind, but of regeneration, of divine life entering the spirit
It means that the Lord was pointing them to God, for in the whole universe God is the only One who is not sinful
God purposely refrained from giving Abraham any information in order to keep Abraham constantly in direct contact with Himself
Knowledge or religion means to be good and to do good, to worship God or to work for God without having the living presence of God
The spirit is our innermost part, the body is our outermost part, and the soul, the main part of our being, stands between them
The two trees that were once in the garden outside of man are now within us, one in our flesh and the other in our spirit
The mind of your soul represents your self, sin in your flesh represents Satan, and the Spirit in your spirit represents God
In the church life today you are surrounded by brothers and sisters who encourage you to enjoy the Lord as your tree of life
When God charged man to till the ground, it meant that man had to be open, broken, and prepared for the tree of life to come into him
The tree of life requires the tilling of the ground, and the tree of knowledge necessitates the guarding of the ground
Since Satan also wants to invade us, we need to guard the ground, leaving no opening for the tree of knowledge
To till the ground is to open ourselves to the tree of life; to guard the ground is to close ourselves to the tree of knowledge
We must realize that in the whole universe there are two sources: one is the source of life, and the other is the source of death
These two lines began at the book of Genesis and continue through the subsequent books of the Bible until they reach their destination
In Ezekiel living water issues out of the house of God; in Revelation 22 living water flows out of the throne of God
At the end of the Bible we have two results, two consummations the city of living water and the lake of burning fire
It is possible that our walk and our work that is, the way we live and work for God might be on the wrong line
The Bible firstly warns people to stay away from the line of knowledge and remain on or return to the line of life
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul cautions us, the builders of the churches, to be careful to build with the proper materials
According to Romans 10:2-3, the Jews seek to establish their own righteousness and do not submit to the righteousness of God
If you visit a Moslem mosque, you will find that the Moslems appear pious and godly, worshipping God by bowing themselves
If you read the original text of the Hebrew and Greek, you will see that the word call means to cry out, not only to pray
The third and fourth generations of mankind learned that in order to contact God they needed to cry out to Him and call on Him
If he says, 'O Lord Jesus, thank You for dying for me,' his spirit will be stirred up and he will touch the Lord in a living way
During peaceful and untroubled times you may retain your composure, unwilling to lose your face by calling on the name of the Lord
The Lord Jesus rebuked the church at Ephesus because they did many works for God but had lost their first love
Abraham's experience reminds us of a battery which operates well after it is charged, but which needs recharging after a period of time
As Abraham lived in the appearing of God and called upon the name of the Lord, he enjoyed Him as the tree of life
After being dealt with by the Lord for a considerable time, he learned to live in the appearing of God and to call upon the name of the Lord
God sovereignly placed him in the palace of Pharoah, and he was brought up as a member of the royal family, as the son of Pharaoh's daughter
Eventually, Moses realized that he could not do anything; he was disappointed to such an extent that he gave up
After Moses had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, God called him to the mountaintop, where he remained for forty days
Although the tree of life had disappeared from unbelieving men, it nevertheless appeared to a person like Moses
Would it not be wonderful to experience such a pillar of cloud and pillar of fire and heavenly manna in Orange County today?
As we journey through the wilderness of Orange County, the Lord is present with us, and we enjoy Him as the tree of life
In one sense our daily walk is a walk, in another sense it is a work, and in still another sense it is a warfare
Samuel was another wonderful person in the Old Testament, a man who prayed for the children of God continually
The Bible refers to Samuel as a man who called upon the name of the Lord and as a man who stood in the presence of God
By standing in the presence of the Lord and by calling on the name of the Lord, he enjoyed the Lord, partaking of Him as the tree of life
The secret of David's life was that he desired to dwell continually in the house of God and to behold His beauty
They want to know about the great image in Daniel 2 the image with the golden head silver shoulders brass abdomen iron legs and clay toes
As we come to the New Testament, we see that the first person on the line of life in the New Testament was the Lord Jesus
In Galatians 2:20 Paul said that Christ lived in him and that the life which he lived he lived by the faith of the Lord Jesus
The promise is found in Revelation 22:14 which says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life'
The whole Bible ends with eating and drinking, with enjoying God as the tree of life and with drinking Him as the water of life
Out of the enjoyment of the Lord as our life supply, we will have our daily life, walk, work, and the building up of the churches
We have seen that the Bible opens with two trees the tree of life which brings in life and the tree of knowledge which brings in knowledge
Cain, the first son of Adam and the second generation of mankind, was the first person to live according to knowledge
Although this appears to be very good, it was wrong because Cain presented an offering to God in his own way, not in God's way
Regardless of the substance that is used as insulation it may even be diamond electricity is cut off nonetheless
Once people have acted in their own way and have left the presence of God, they desire to erect a building for themselves
The first kingdom in human history was probably the kingdom of Babel formed by Nimrod, who also built the great city of Nineveh in Assyria
The result of the council at Babel was the construction of a high tower for man's name and the formation of a city for his possession
Although Lot was a saved person, he drifted away from the line of life by making a choice according to his own sight
Since God created man in His own image to be His expression, it means that, by birth, man has the right to express God
To believe in the Lord Jesus means to come back to our human birthright, to come back to the enjoyment of God and to the expression of God
While Moses was on the mount enjoying God as the tree of life, Aaron and the people were at the foot of the mountain
There are times when we should not listen to the people, for the congregation may present a proposal that is against God
Aaron seemed to be defending himself, asking Moses not to condemn him and apparently thinking that he had not done very much
Miriam and Aaron were opposed to Moses, not as a result of their contacting God, but because of their own motive
The record of the Bible shows us that only one leadership has ever been faultless the leadership of the Lord Jesus
Because the ten spies looked at the situation by their own sight, they did not trust in the Lord as did Caleb and Joshua
You may consider that you are right in attacking the leaders in the church, but you must examine the result death or life?
You must ask yourself, 'Does my attack proceed out of the spirit, out of the throne of God, or does it come from my mind'?
Attack against God's deputy authority, regardless of the reason, is on the line of knowledge that brings in death
If they had taken care of the presence of God, they would have been rescued from their attack against Moses and Aaron
God had told him to smite and kill all of his enemies, but Saul spared some of them because they were good in his sight
According to the record of 2 Samuel 13 18, he was a person who acted altogether on his own and by his knowledge
He married Jezebel, a devilish and idolatrous woman, and built a temple for Baal, the most famous idol of the time
Although the chief priests and scribes had the knowledge of the Bible, the result of their knowledge was death
Although the book of John reveals that the Lord Jesus several times was challenged to give yes or no answers, He always refused to do so
When the Lord spoke this to them, His word touched their conscience and, beginning with the most experienced ones, they turned away
The disciples who were with the Lord still held the traditional knowledge of religion when they saw a man blind from birth
Based upon their religious knowledge, they asked, 'Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind'?
The Lord answered, 'Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him'
She was occupied with the line of knowledge, holding the knowledge of the sound teachings regarding the resurrection on the last day
It is easy to be usurped and utilized by Satan when we exercise our mind in the line of knowledge to think independently of the Lord
Since his mind was occupied with thoughts of money he opened himself to the Devil, who put into his heart the thought of betraying the Lord
The Scriptures should be the tree of life, which brings us life, but they can be the tree of knowledge, which brings us death
He was exceedingly zealous of the tradition of his fathers and surpassed many of his equals in the Jewish religion
At that time the Roman politics did not damage the believers as much as did the Hebrew religion and the Greek philosophy
Since they had received Christ, they should also walk in Him , not according to philosophy, human concepts, or worldly rudiments
Paul charged us to be watchful over the dissenting ones because they like to teach differently and contend for contrary doctrines
Revelation 2 mentions the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, the teachings of Jezebel, and the depths of Satan
The early churches were deceived by such teachings and turned away from the eating of the Lord and the feasting with the Lord
In these two verses we see the tree that was in the garden of Eden and the manna that was in the wilderness both of which are Christ Himself
According to Revelation 3:20, the Lord promises a feast to everyone who will open to Him as He knocks on the door
What does it mean to eat of the tree of life, to partake of the hidden manna, and to feast with the Lord Jesus?
If, in the midst of the confusions and divisions of the day, we go along with the teachings, we will be killed
If we take care of the enjoyment of the Lord, that is, to be on the line of life, we will receive life and live
He will be the giant on the line of knowledge in the Bible, knowing and caring for nothing on the line of life
The Bible in dead letters, which belongs to the tree of knowledge, kills, while the Spirit, who belongs to the tree of life, gives life
Due to our limited ability to understand them, God was forced to disclose His divine revelation in the way of picture and allegory
We should not understand them merely according to the outward letters, but probe into the inner sense of the figures
If we read through the whole Bible, we will realize that the marriage found in Genesis 2 is indeed an allegory
If we have the spiritual vision from Ephesians 5, we will see that Eve in the garden was a prefigure of the church
It is simply a photograph of Brother John, depicting his appearance and giving you some idea of what he is like
Although the photograph is not the real person, it does afford you some understanding of the person, relieving you of the need to guess
Genesis 1 reveals God's eternal purpose, which is to express Himself through man and to exercise His dominion with man
Although you are familiar with the story of Adam's marriage, perhaps you have never been impressed with its significance
When Adam awoke from his sleep and looked at Eve he said, 'This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh'
Only those who are regenerated of Christ and who live by Christ as the church can match Christ and complement Him
According to the Bible, Adam in the garden is called the first Adam, and the Lord Jesus as the real Adam is called the last Adam
When the soldiers came to Jesus to break His legs they found that He had died already and that there was no need for them to break His bones
As regenerated ones who have Him as life and who live by Him, we compose His church, the real Eve in resurrection
When Christ saw the church He might have said, 'I have seen the cattle, lions, turtles, fishes, and birds, but none of them could match Me
After seeing the significance of the type of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2, we can never again refer to a physical building as the church
Figuratively speaking, these things should not be considered as Eve, but as all the other things named by Adam
At that time, especially on the day of Pentecost, He could say, 'This time it is bone of My bones and flesh of My flesh'
Only that which comes out of the resurrection life of Christ can be His complement and counterpart, the Body of Christ
At that wedding day He will look at the overcomers and say, 'This time it is bone of My bones and flesh of My flesh'
Many times, even among us, the life within says, 'This is not,' but even more times the resurrection life says, 'This is it'
If we have such a vision as we read the Bible, we will understand the Song of Songs: Christ is our love and we are His beloved
Also, we will understand the whole New Testament in the way of life, not in a natural way or in the way of knowledge
In another, fuller sense we have only the foretaste today and are awaiting the full taste of the marriage to come
Following that, the church will be consummated as the New Jerusalem, which will be the completed bride of Christ for eternity
At the end of the Bible all of these materials have been built up into a city, which is the ultimate and eternal woman
In this way we will be transformed and conformed to His image, prepared for the wedding feast at the time of His return
The result of Adam's sleep in which his side was opened to release a rib was that he gained Eve as his complement to match him
The coming New Jerusalem will be just the unity of God and man, a living, complete unit composed with divinity and humanity
In eternity, God in Christ will be the center, reality, and life of man's living, and man will live by God in Christ as life
Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 may be considered as the building process, and Revelation 21 and 22 as a photograph of the finished building
The so-called modern critics, who do not believe in the Bible, mainly direct their attacks at the books of Genesis and Revelation
The book of Revelation shows us that in the churches God has gained a group of overcomers who will defeat Satan
The Lord Jesus has been unable to return because as yet there has been no victorious ground on which He can set His feet
As we have seen, Genesis 1 reveals God's eternal purpose and heart's desire, and Genesis 2 reveals God's way of fulfilling His purpose
Whatever is first mentioned in a particular field establishes the principle for all the subsequent items in that field
The Lord Jesus spoke of him as a liar saying, 'When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it'
When Satan approached Eve he was very crafty, pretending to be what he was not and appearing in an incarnational way
We should be cautious of anyone who is clever, for it is easy for clever people to be taken over by the serpent
We must remember to be careful of anything that is clever and crafty, because Satan may be hidden in such a thing
Satan will always try to tempt you, induce you, and trap you by making a proposal which raises questions about God's Word
Any time you doubt the Word of God you must realize that that doubt does not originate with you; it comes from the serpent
The safest way for her would have been not to talk to the evil one, but to turn to her husband and hide behind him
If we try on our own to be victorious, that very effort is a defeat because it keeps us away from our husband, our Head
To try to do anything by yourself means that you are assuming the headship and forgetting your position as a wife
Although we might have prayed a great deal, when the problem presented itself we forgot our husband and acted as if we had none
All Christians know how to pray and ask God to help them, but few of them know that they have a spirit to which they can turn
If we will learn to turn to our spirit and to exercise our spirit in every situation, the results will be marvelous
Whenever you do a certain thing or contact a person without being with God it proves that you are not using your spirit
Although man did not use his spirit, he did exercise his soul, signifying that man, represented by the soul, assumed the headship
If we are able to stop our thinking and turn to prayer, it proves that we are a person walking with the Lord and living in His presence
If you are a talkative person, so active and strong in your mind, it will be difficult for you to calm yourself for a few minutes of prayer
As many brothers and sisters are shopping and see a particular item they want, they reason with themselves, saying, 'I need this
While you were reasoning, the little serpent was present, stirring up your emotion, strengthening your will, and saying, 'Go and buy it'
If in the matter of shopping we forsake our spirit and use our soul, our body will take us to the department store
Eve should not have spoken to the evil one, for while she was talking with him his wicked thought entered into her mind
The body was then changed in nature, having the element of the tree of knowledge, the element of Satan, added to it, making it the flesh
As originally created by God, the human body was a pure vessel containing one essence, the element created by God
As a result of eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, a foreign element was injected into man's body, transmuting it into the flesh
We should have no confidence in our flesh because it has been fully occupied and saturated with the sin of Satan
No one can deny or argue the fact that, although we might have been saved for years, we still have this evil element in our flesh
As a consequence of the fall man's spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God
As a result of the fall man's spirit was deadened; it became functionless and senseless, no longer possessing the ability to contact God
Due to the fall man's soul was corrupted, his body changed in nature, and his spirit was deadened, losing its function toward God
We must realize that this was not merely a matter of outward transgression; it was an inward damage to man's being
There is a certain constitution within the being of fallen man, and the main element of this constitution is the satanic nature
Do not think that you are a sinner simply because you are wrong or sinful in your outward doings, in your behavior
Since we have transgressed God's prohibition we not only have a sinful element inwardly, but also a court case outwardly
According to Genesis 32324 we see that when man was expelled from the garden God guarded the tree of life with cherubim and a flaming sword
God's glory, righteousness, and holiness guarded the sphere of life from sinful man until the time that the Lord Jesus came
Genesis 3 not only unveils the cause, process, and result of man's first fall, but also reveals the way God used to deal with this fall
The Lord was not the son of that carpenter who later became the husband of the virgin Mary, of which virgin Jesus was born
Jesus was not the seed of any man He was the seed of a woman a virgin as prophesied in Isaiah fulfilled in Matthew and confirmed by Paul
If Adam had been honest when God asked him where he was, he would have confessed his transgression immediately, but he did not do this
Instead of forthrightly confessing his own transgression, he discharged himself of the responsibility by placing it upon the woman
God came to man in the garden in the same way that His Son was to come many centuries later: He came to save, not to judge
When God came to Adam and Eve He asked them questions, but when He turned to the serpent He asked no questions at all
Whenever we walk in our flesh we become a delectable dish for Satan, and whenever we are soulish we become a meal for the Devil
God did not relinquish control of the situation and He did not allow the woman and the serpent to fend for themselves
According to Genesis 3:15, the seed of the woman would destroy the serpent, but the serpent could only injure the heel of the woman's seed
Like most of the items mentioned in Genesis 1 through 3, Genesis 3:15 is a seed, a tremendously significant seed of the gospel
We must become familiar with three classes of people the woman, the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the woman
After reading the foregoing message we should realize that the proper position of human beings is that of a woman
The woman of Genesis 3:15 is firstly Eve and secondly all the people who rely upon God and who put their trust in God
The enmity between the serpent and the woman is the enmity between Satan and Eve, between Satan and all of God's people
In the glad tidings which God announced in Genesis 3:15 God said that He would put enmity between the serpent and the woman
According to 1 John 312 this act of murder was not merely a crime perpetrated by Cain but a deed performed by the wicked one by the serpent
When Adam heard that the woman was going to have a seed, he called his wife's name Eve, which in Hebrew means 'living'
If Adam had not reacted to the gospel he would have called his wife Dying saying Poor woman dont you know that you are the cause of death
When the people hear the glad tidings of Genesis 3:15, receiving the gospel and responding to it, they will shout, 'Now we are living
In 1 John 3 the Apostle John said that everyone who practices sin is of the Devil ; he also used the term 'the children of the Devil'
The woman depicted in Revelation 12 and signified in Genesis 3:15 is a universal woman, and within her is a part called the manchild
The universal woman of Revelation 12 has two parts: the outer part, which is the woman herself, and the inner part, which is the manchild
We find the same three items in Revelation 12, where we see the old serpent, the universal woman, and the manchild
It is difficult for us to understand these three items without reading through the entire Bible until we come to the book of Revelation
Since the woman herself is not individual, but universal and corporate, her child must also be universal and corporate
According to the record of the Bible, both the Lord Jesus Himself and His overcomers will rule over the nations with a rod of iron
The enmity between the serpent and the woman's seed mentioned in Genesis 3:15 is fully manifested in Revelation 12
The woman is the source of the seed, and the seed, part of which is the manchild that defeats the enemy, is stronger than the woman
Genesis 3:15 does not mention the seed of man, for only the seed of woman, not the seed of man, has the position before God
The focus, the central point, of Genesis 3:15 is that the seed of woman, the Lord Jesus, would come to destroy Satan on the cross
He will continue to be their enemy until he is cast into the abyss and ultimately hurled into the lake of fire
When the Lord Jesus was born, the serpent stirred up a great deal of enmity, causing many young lives to be lost
If we read the four Gospels, we will see that Satan was continually troubling the Lord Jesus, pursuing Him and opposing Him
As we read through the Scriptures, we find the serpent is not only mentioned in Genesis, but also in other books of the Bible
In Revelation 12 and 20 we find that Satan has various names the dragon, the ancient serpent, the Devil, and Satan
The only way to answer this question is to consult the third chapter of Genesis where the serpent is first mentioned
The Lord told him that his human spirit needed to be reborn of the Holy Spirit, for 'that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
Not many Christians have observed that in His conversation with Nicodemus the Lord pointed that gentleman to the serpent
Although Nicodemus was a gentleman, a teacher, and a 'master of Israel,' the Lord indicated that he was a serpent
The Lord seemed to be saying to him, 'Your fathers were all bitten by poisonous serpents, and the poison of the serpents entered into them
Everyone who had been poisoned by the serpents and who looked to the brass serpent lifted up on the pole lived'
You must realize that you are one of the people who has been poisoned by the serpent and that you have the serpentine nature within you
Nearly all Christians have seen the eternal life in John 3:16, but not many have seen the serpent in John 3:14
In Genesis 315 the serpent is a little seed in the Gospel of John this seed grows and in the book of Revelation this seed becomes a harvest
We all must be on the alert because Satan, the one who tempted and damaged the first generation of mankind, is now within us
As children of the Devil, people who have been born of the serpent, we all have the serpentine nature and life
Apparently little children are sweet; however, the more they grow, the more the serpentine nature within them is exposed
If we did not have such a record as Matthew 16, no one would believe that Peter, a leading apostle, could have become Satan
Some Christians think to themselves, 'After we are saved and are in the Body of Christ, Satan has nothing to do with us'
As all the fundamental teachers agree, this woman also refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, because the seed of the woman was the Lord Jesus
The woman has a threefold significance, not only signifying Eve and the virgin Mary, but also the woman revealed in Revelation 12
The sun signified Jacob, Joseph's father; the moon signified Joseph's mother; and the eleven stars signified Joseph's brothers
According to the Bible, the people of God can be classified into three categories: the patriarchs, Israel, and the church
Now we can see that this woman is composed of the patriarchs, Israel, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, and all the church people
As we pointed out in message nineteen, some fundamental Christians say that the manchild is the Lord Jesus Christ
In the following verse it says that after the rapture of the manchild there will be a period of 'a thousand two hundred and sixty days'
The 'one week' of Daniel 9:27 specifies an era of seven years considered by all Bible teachers as the period of the great tribulation
After the rapture of the manchild to the throne of God, there will only be the last half of the last seven years
The manchild in Revelation 12 certainly is the complete fulfillment of the prophecy regarding the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15
Firstly we have an individual mother with an individual seed, but eventually we have a corporate mother with a corporate manchild
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, Satan, the serpent, was the strong man, and the Lord exercised His authority to bind him
Peter says that we were regenerated not by a corrupted or a corrupting seed but by an incorruptible seed the living and abiding Word of God
The writer does not ask Christ, the Desire of nations, to come to die on the cross for us, but to 'Fix in us Thy humble home'
We all must praise the Lord that He has fixed His humble home in us and that He is now bruising the head of the serpent within us
Revelation 2:26-27 is a quotation from Psalm 2, a prophecy concerning Christ that predicts His rule over the nations
In the fulfillment in Revelation 2:26-27 the overcomers are revealed as the ones who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron
According to Revelation 20:1-6, we will also be co-kings with Christ to rule with Him in the millennial kingdom
God ordained that the mother-in-law be a restriction to the daughter-in-law and that the daughter-in-law be a problem to the mother-in-law
Any sister who is willing to accept restrictions from her husband, children, and mother-in-law will be protected
You will feel like giving up your business because, instead of producing dollars, it grows thorns and thistles
In every kind of employment in the schools, factories, markets, and offices it seems easy for the ground to grow thorns and thistles
After the fall God also ordained that man should not live forever, but that he should die, returning to the ground
None of the Mah-Jongg players like to sleep; they prefer to play Mah-Jongg day and night for seventy-two hours without resting
In a sense, death is a suffering for man; yet, man does not realize that it is truly God's way of protecting him
In Genesis 3:21 we see an anticipation of the redemption that was to be accomplished four thousand years later
The first time that the Bible indicates the matter of believing is in Genesis 3:20, and the first believer in the good news was Adam
Anything that you do to cover yourself is just a skirt made from the withered fig leaves of the vegetable life
The seed of believing in God's gospel is found in Genesis 3:20 where Adam declared that Eve's name was 'Living'
When God proclaimed the gospel and Adam responded by saying, 'Living,' that was the seed of believing in the gospel
After God had come in to preach the gospel and Adam had responded by believing, God placed coats over the man and the woman
To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself, not with anything man-made
To be sure, the skins did not come from cows; they must have been the skins of tender lambs, skins so suitable for clothing
When Adam and Eve were covered by their self-made skirts of fig leaves, they must have looked like ugly, naked, sinful persons
In type, when the lambs were slain, Christ had already been slain in the eyes of God, for He was slain from the foundation of the world
We have been redeemed by the precious blood of God's Lamb ordained by God for us before the foundation of the world
Without the shedding of blood, it would not have been legal, lawful, righteous, or fair for God to put a covering upon fallen man
Whenever we respond to the gospel and say, 'Living,' God immediately comes and covers us with Christ as our righteousness
Although many Christians talk about substitution, about Christ's having died in our place, not many realize the matter of union
If the lambs and Adam and Eve had been separate from one another, the lambs could not have substituted for them
Once Adam believed in the glad tidings God covered him with a coat of the lamb skins, and he became one with the lamb
Christ has done everything for us on the cross, but without union all that He has accomplished on the cross is unrelated to us
When we preach the gospel, some people always ask us, 'As long as Christ has died for us on the cross, why do we need to believe?
If you do not have union with Him, whatever He has done on the cross cannot be appropriated by you or applied to you
According to California law, because of the union between husband and wife, whatever the husband has in his name also belongs to his wife
Whatever He has, whatever He is, whatever He has done and is going to do, whatever He has attained and obtained everything is ours
Genesis tells us that after God had prepared the anticipated redemption for man, He closed the way to the tree of life
As we have said previously regarding other items in these chapters of Genesis, we must allegorize all of the figures in Genesis 3
It is absolutely correct to allegorize the Old Testament, for both the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul did this
On Mount Sinai we see a picture of three items: the glory of God, the holiness of God, and the righteousness of God
When the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, went into the holy place with strange fire, they were burned to death
The way to the tree of life was closed during the period of time preceding the accomplishment of redemption by the Lord Jesus
By His all-inclusive death on the cross Christ fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
Through the death of Christ God's holiness is ours, and the requirement of His holiness is a problem to us no longer
Through the death of Christ the righteousness of God has become ours and it cannot keep us from the righteous God who is the tree of life
The way to the tree of life has been completely opened to us once again through the accomplishment of Christ's redemption
Since Christ has fulfilled the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, His blood has opened for us a new and living way
He is not afraid that we will live forever with our fallen nature because it has been terminated by the all-inclusive death of Christ
We need to turn to our spirit and through the blood of Jesus enter into the Holiest of all where we can touch the tree of life
After seeing man's first fall and God's proclamation of the glad tidings as recorded in Genesis 3, we now come to Genesis 4
In this message we come to a further step of man's fall and also to a further step in the proclamation of God's glad tidings
Although Adam's response in Genesis 3:20 proves that he believed the gospel, we find no indication in that chapter that Eve also believed
Eve's words in Genesis 4:1 prove that she had believed that promise and that she was expecting to have that seed
According to Eve's understanding, the child she bore in 4:1 was the fulfillment of the promise regarding the seed of the woman in 3:15
Although Eve herself did not give birth to the man, Jehovah, she symbolized the virgin Mary who gave birth to Him
Jesus, Jehovah, the Savior, is truly the man, Jehovah to whom Eve supposed that she had given birth as mentioned in Genesis 4:1
Adam believed and called his wifes name Living Eve believed and called her son acquired thinking that she had acquired what God had promised
Evidence of this is found in Hebrews 11:4 which says, 'By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain'
He did not present his sacrifice according to his own opinion or learning, and his offering was not his own invention
Eve, a good wife and mother, was also a believer, following her believing husband and opening the way for her child to believe
During Abel's time sheep were of no use for man's eating, since, before the flood, man was only permitted to eat vegetables
If we enter into the thought of Genesis 4:2, we shall see that Abel was not working for his living, but for God's satisfaction
Cain, the firstborn of the second human generation, was an example of continuing the fall and of turning from God's way of salvation
With Adam and Eve there were two main matters: the fall which they caused and the gospel which they received and preached
Apparently it was Cain that rejected God's glad tidings; actually it was Satan that kept him from God's way of salvation
At the time of Genesis 4 the Devil had already injected himself into man, and God had shown man His way of salvation
God slew some lambs for sin offerings and from the skins of those lambs He made robes to cover the man and the woman
We have seen that Adam and Eve must have told Cain and Abel about this and that Abel received their word and acted on it
He labored on the ground until it produced fruit and then he preserved some of that fruit as an offering to God
Although Adam was pure when created by God, as a result of the fall Satan, the evil one, injected himself into man
When religious people see others serving God in His way and thus gaining His respect, they will be even more furious
Other versions render the pronouns 'his' and 'him' as 'its' and 'it,' meaning that sin's desire is for you and that you must overcome it
Because Cain had rejected God's way and God's warning, he was caught by Satan, the murderer, and became a murderer with Satan
By murdering his brother Cain became completely possessed by the Devil, for the Devil murdered Abel by Cain's hand and with his cooperation
He, motivated by Satan, served God according to his own invention and eventually was totally possessed by Satan and became a murderer
Worshipping God according to a manmade religion was not a rescue from the first fall, but a continuation of it
If you read history you will discover that the Roman Catholic Church has killed more genuine Christians than the Roman Empire
Presumption means that man does not care for God's economy, for God's way, but that he only cares for his own desires and concepts
When man refused to follow God's way, inventing instead his own religion, he eventually became a murderer of God's people
According to the revelation of the divine Word, these two brothers should be considered as two important seeds sown in Genesis 4
The Lord Jesus was alluding to Cain in John 8:44 when He said that the Devil 'was a murderer from the beginning'
As we saw in the previous message, Cain became one with the Devil and, thus, both Cain and the Devil were the murderer of Abel
We have seen that in the beginning man was placed in front of two trees, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge
The great Babylon will be the ultimate consummation both of the line of the tree of knowledge and of the seed of Cain
The New Jerusalem will not only be the ultimate consummation of the line of the tree of life, but also of the seed of Abel
The great Babylon is the ultimate consummation of so many Cains, and the New Jerusalem is the totality of all the Abels
Let us now consider these two brothers more thoroughly, examining them in the light of the subsequent books of the Bible
As we pointed out in the last message, Adam and Eve told their children about this, declaring God's way of salvation
Cain and Abel were not born of pure parents; they were the descendants of polluted, corrupted, contaminated, and ruined parents
As long as he can keep us from God's way and frustrate us in fulfilling God's purpose, Satan will even motivate us to do things for God
The real issue is not whether or not we worship God; it is whether or not we are one with the Devil in whatever we do
Even if you love others by being one with the Devil, that kind of love is an insult to God, because Satan, God's enemy, is active in it
Cain was the one who presented the offering, but the Devil was the motivator, the one who initiated Cain's act of worship
Although Cain should have realized that what God wanted was a sacrifice with the shedding of blood, he did not offer it accordingly
He worshipped God according to his own concept, without the shedding of blood, and without the covering skins of the sacrifice
He rejected God's way of taking Christ as God's righteousness to cover him as revealed in Philippians 3:9 and 1 Corinthians 1:30
Although in a sense both Adam and Eve were lost God came in to bring them back to Himself opening His redeeming way the bloodshedding way
We have a Bible of sixtysix books telling us in full of the way of salvation the way of life the way of shedding blood and the way of Christ
Apparently this is good; actually it is dreadful, for by inventing religion the second human generation was completely captured by Satan
God does not care whether or not you are on the good side or on the bad; He only cares whether or not you are on His way of redemption
Many religious people people who have invented their own religion think of themselves as higher than those who follow Gods way of salvation
As long as you are not in God's way you are following Satan's way, regardless of whether you are doing good or evil
Whenever we, outside of Christ, try to do good to please God, in the eyes of God we are following the footsteps of Cain
In that word of warning God indicated that sin was a person, Satan, that his desire was for Cain, and that Cain had to overcome him
It was not in a theater; it was between the temple and the altar, in the place where the religious people worshipped God
Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God's way of salvation
He offered some firstlings of his flock, shedding the blood for his redemption and burning the fat for God's satisfaction
Regardless of the excellence of your thoughts, Satan is in them, and you must reject them and take God's way according to His revelation
According to Numbers 18:17, the firstling of a cow or sheep, a type Christ, could not be eaten by the Israelites; it had to offered to God
We need the blood of Christ to cleanse us and we need Christ Himself to cover us that we may be accepted by God and that we may satisfy Him
Hebrews 11:4 says that by the sacrifice which he offered in faith as a type of Christ Abel obtained the witness that he was righteous
Abel was persecuted and killed by Cain because he worshipped God in God's way, not like Cain who worshipped God in his own way
In Matthew 23:35 Abel was called 'righteous Abel'; in Acts 7:52 and 22:14 the Lord Jesus is called the Righteous One
We not only have the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, and the covering blood, but also the speaking blood
Christ is the embodiment of God dwelling in our spirit, and sin is the embodiment of Satan dwelling in our flesh
Peter did not realize that Satan was present in his concept, but the Lord recognized it and called Peter 'Satan'
John 8:44 makes it evident that Cain was not the only one telling the lie, but that the Devil also lied from the beginning
Notice now the development of the seed in Genesis 4: it began with worshipping God and developed into lying to God
God seemed to be saying, 'Since you have done such evil things, the ground will be under a greater curse than it was before
It will be cursed to the extent that regardless how much you labor upon it, it will not yield to you its strength'
A vagabond has no dwelling place and no comfort; he continually wanders on the earth, floating from place to place
If, at any time, Cain would have repented and sought God's forgiveness, the Lord would have been happy to forgive him
Cain understood God's words in this way, realizing that he was about to be driven out from the face of the earth
A number of times Brother Watchman Nee said to me, 'If someone thinks that you might steal from him, that person must be a robber
He gave the same name to his son and to his city, for, in a sense, his city was his child and he loved it as he loved his own son
By reading this short portion of the Word we can see how dreadful was the first human culture, a culture without God
During that time, in the whole island of Wales, all the theaters and amusement places were closed because all the people were saved
The father cut the way of believing in the gospel, the mother paved the way, and the son, Abel, walked on this way
Revelation 18 enumerates many items of merchandise, all of which are for three things to fulfill lusts, to adorn people, and to amuse people
They sell things for the gratification of man's lust, for the adornment of women, and for the amusement of young people
A godless culture began to develop in Genesis 4 and will continue to develop until it climaxes in the Great Babylon
The issue of this culture is the fulfilling of lust, the committing of adultery, and the fighting against and slaying of one another
We see from the holy Word that the small seed injected into human nature in Genesis 3 has developed to such a degree
The lost people, on the contrary, are finished in His sight, and their days and years are not counted before Him
We are told clearly how long Adam and Methuselah lived nine hundred thirty years and nine hundred sixty-nine years respectively
Genesis 5 also speaks of Enoch a different Enoch from that found in Genesis 4 telling us that he lived three hundred sixty-five years
We have seen that nearly every item found in the first chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible
It means to do good, to worship God, and to serve God according to our human concept and not according to God's revelation
Doing anything of ourselves, regardless of how good it is according to our own concept, is presumptuous and is one with the Devil
We must do everything according to the way revealed by God that we may be kept from the Devil and from the furtherance of the fall
If we want to escape the second fall of man, we must live for God and worship God according to His way, as Abel did
In order to escape the second fall of man we must realize that as fallen men without God everything we are, have, and do is empty
If we have this realization, we will have no trust in ourselves and, thus, we will not be presumptuous in departing from the way of God
When we see that our life is vanity and that we ourselves are frail, spontaneously we will call upon the name of the Lord
Men did not call on the One who created all things, but on the One who was so near to them, on the One who was closely related to them
Breathing out my sinful nature, Thou hast borne it all for me; Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness, Finding all my life in Thee
We need to call out to Him and even cry to Him, for, as Jeremiah has told us, calling on the Lord is to cry out to Him
In verse 4 we find that praising and calling are put together, and in verse 6 we find that crying and shouting are put together
The more you shout, 'O Lord Jesus, You are so good to me,' the more you will be released from your self and be filled with the Lord
It is no exaggeration to say that even if a needle fell on the floor in their meetings, it would have been heard
Seth, Abel's brother, called his son Enosh, which indicates that Seth realized that human life was weak, frail, and mortal
Not only did the Old Testament saints call on the Lord; they even prophesied that people would call on His name
On the day of Pentecost God poured out His Spirit, and the early saints received the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus he received authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on the name of the Lord
Saul of Tarsus felt that it would be easy to identify the Christians in Damascus by the fact that they called on the Lord's name
There are many true Christians who pray to the Lord daily, yet their neighbors, friends, and classmates do not know that they are Christians
Do you know what happened to Saul when he was on the way to Damascus with the intention of binding all that call on the Lord's name?
Ananias, who had been sent by the Lord, told Saul to be baptized and to wash away his sins by calling on the name of the Lord
When Ananias was about to baptize Saul, he seemed to tell him, 'Brother, wash away your sins by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
Once Saul called on the name of the Lord, all the Christians could see that the persecutor had become one of their brothers
He said, 'For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him
By all of these verses we can see that in the first century the Christians practiced the matter of calling on the name of the Lord very much
Throughout the Old Testament as well as in the early days of the Christian age, the saints called on the Lord's name
If you would not only help him to pray, but also to call upon the name of the Lord, his experience of salvation would be much stronger
Another reason for calling on the Lord is to be rescued from distress , from trouble , and from sorrow and pain
People who have argued about calling on the Lord found themselves calling on Him when they were subject to a certain trouble or illness
Psalm 116:3-4 tells us that calling on the name of the Lord rescues us from many negative things such as pain, sorrow, death, and hell
Psalm 86:5 says that the Lord is good, ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all them that call upon Him
As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water out of the wells of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord
Isaiah gives us the way in verse 6 of the same chapter: 'Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near'
The way to drink the spiritual water and to eat the spiritual food for our satisfaction is to seek the Lord and to call upon His name
The Lord is not only rich, but also nigh and available as mentioned in verse 8 of the same chapter because He is the life-giving Spirit
Isaiah 64:7 says, 'And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee'
When we feel that we are down or low, we can lift and stir ourselves up by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
Timothy 2:22 says, 'Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
Although it may sound logical to say that we need not call on Him since He already indwells us, it is not practical
If you complain about those who call on the Lord loudly, you need to ask the Lord Jesus why He prayed with strong crying
At least twice in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said that He was not alone, that the Father was always with Him
My burden and intention in this message are simply to give an account of the Bible regarding the matter of calling on the Lord
If you consider what the Bible says about calling on the Lord, you will be convinced that calling on His name is not a recent invention
As we have seen from Genesis 4:26, calling on the name of the Lord began thousands of years ago, even from the third generation of mankind
As we saw in the last message, at the end of Genesis 4 we have the wonderful matter of calling on the name of the Lord
It does not matter whether we are male or female because both male and female, both husband and wife, were called Adam
Following Adam, Seth lived a hundred five years and begat Enosh and then lived another eight hundred seven years
Genesis 4 tells us of many of the things that they invented religion, city planning, city building, farming, music, and weapons
If you read Genesis 5 along with Luke 3, you will see that the genealogy in Genesis 5 eventually brought forth the Lord Jesus
When Genesis 5 and Luke 3 are put together, we see that all the dear ones in Genesis 5 were not living in vanity
The record of the genealogy in Genesis 5 is wonderful as far as the people's living and begetting are concerned
If you compare this genealogy with the genealogy in Matthew 1, you will see that in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 there is no death
Before Enoch was taken up by the Lord and while he was living and walking on earth, death had ceased to kill him
It is not only to live for God and to do things for God, but to live and to do things according to God and with God
On the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus walked with the two disciples who were going from Jerusalem to Emmaus
Do you believe that Enoch walked with God inconsistently and that God said to him, 'Poor child, come up quickly'?
Enoch looked at the situation, the environment, the people and their deeds, and saw that everything was ungodly
Although the Bible says little about Enoch, what is revealed in Genesis, Hebrews, and Jude is sufficient for us to appreciate his life
And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying: Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints'
Enoch did not say that the Lord is coming with myriads of sinners or ungodly ones or even believers or saved ones
Otherwise, he could not have prophesied of the Lord's coming with myriads of His saints to execute His judgment upon the ungodly
Although the generation, age, society, environment, people, and everything were ungodly, Enoch still lived a godly and holy life
By Enoch's prophecy we can realize that he learned that God was going to execute His judgment upon the ungodly generation
Thereafter, day and night, Enoch was expecting the fulfillment of that prophecy, and that expectation caused him to walk with God
Methuselah begat Lamech at the age of one hundred eighty-seven , and Lamech begat Noah when he was one hundred eighty-two
If we add these three figures together, we arrive at a total of nine hundred sixty-nine years, the age at which Methuselah died
If Enoch had remained on the earth until the actual time of the deluge, he would have waited nine hundred sixty-nine years
Although the Lord told us that He is coming quickly , over nineteen hundred years have passed, and He still has not come
If we study Genesis carefully, we shall realize that the intention of the Holy Spirit is to show man's continuous degradation
We have seen that the enemy of God, who had entered into fallen man, became a subjective cause of the second fall
Each fall, of course, was the fall of man, but the cause in each case was not merely man himself, but also the enemy of God
Although you might have studied the book of Genesis several times, you probably have never noticed the secret mystery of Satan's device
In the third fall Satan caused the evil spirits that is the fallen angels to mingle with man and to join with man through illegal marriage
Satan has a kingdom, meaning that he has under his rule a good number of principalities, dominions, and powers
Very few Christians know that the human race was once polluted by being mixed with fallen angels, the fallen spirits
How can you say that the sons of God were the descendants of Seth and that the daughters of men were the descendants of Cain?
Brother Nee then argued that we cannot say that only the daughters of Cain and not also the sons of Seth were the descendants of men
Brother Nee went on to say that in Jude 6 and 7 there is a strong proof that the sons of God mentioned in Genesis 6 were fallen angels
The fallen angels committed fornication with strange persons, setting up an example which was followed by Sodom and Gomorrah
When Peter and Jude wrote about the degradation, they wrote with the facts recorded in Genesis as a background
God's dwelling place is the third heaven, man's dwelling place is the earth, and Satan's and his angels' dwelling place is the air
Because the subject of this sentence is not only Sodom and Gomorrah but also the cities around them we need a comma after the word them
God has ordained this holy principle in order to keep the human race in a proper condition for the fulfillment of His purpose
Sodom, Gomorrah, and the cities about them followed this example, breaking the governing principle ordained by God
How could a God of love flood people, burn their cities, and slaughter the Canaanites at the hand of the Israelites'?
Eventually, God said to me, 'Child, haven't you seen that before the flood the human race had become a mixture?
The 'mighty men which were of old, men of renown' in 6:4 were a product of the fallen spirits mingled with the human race
Although the King James Version uses the word 'giants' in Genesis 6:4 and Numbers 13:33, the Hebrew should be rendered 'Nephilim'
The Nephilim were not purely angels, but were the product of the mixture of the fallen angels with the daughters of men
The Nephilim which they saw should be again the descendants of the fallen angels that had mingled with the daughters of men
God slaughtered all the Canaanites because the Nephilim again were among them, and the blood of that race again was no longer pure
In the entire Bible, especially in the teaching of the Lord Jesus , fornication is regarded as a serious matter
When you read the Epistles in the New Testament you can see that the apostles were very strict not tolerating fornication in the church life
In China, in front of the idol temples where people worshipped idols, the opera was performed quite often with the stories of fornication
If you read the book of Numbers, you will see that when the Israelites worshipped idols, they committed fornication
The true worship of God keeps us pure with respect to marriage, maintaining the governing principle ordained by God
If you are a person who exercises a proper intellect and reason, you will not allow an evil spirit to come into you
Genesis 6:3 says, 'And the Lord said, My spirit shall not strive with man forever, for that he indeed is flesh'
The first mention is in 1:3, which says that God's Spirit was hovering over the dead situation in order to bring life into being
The second issue of man's third fall was the coming of the deluge, which brought in the judgment of destruction
The main purpose of the record of Genesis is not to show the fall, but to show how much God's grace can do for fallen people
In Genesis 6 we see that Noah certainly was saved, pleased God, called on the name of the Lord, and enjoyed all that He is
In addition to all of these positive aspects of the life of the saved ones, Genesis 6 shows us even more items
Undoubtedly, Noah inherited all the spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, etc
And he followed his great grandfather, Enoch, to walk with God in a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation
Hebrews 4:16 tells us to come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in time of need
When Adam was six hundred twenty-two years of age, Enoch was born and he lived as a contemporary of Adam for three hundred and eight years
When Enoch was sixty-five, he begat Methuselah and then lived for another three hundred years before he was taken away
Methuselah lived for nine hundred sixty-nine years, dying in Noah's six hundredth year, the year the deluge came
The fact that Enoch named his son Methuselah which means when he is dead it shall be sent proves that he taught his son concerning God
The more we touch the throne of God and the more we look to the Lord, the more we are transfused and infused with all that He is
If you simply come to the throne of grace, looking unto Him, touching Him, and finding grace, you will be infused with the believing God
Noah was a righteous man , and Hebrews 11:7 says that he 'became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith'
He believed in God, and immediately his believing was reckoned unto him by God as righteousness as God did with Abraham
Because he found grace in the eyes of the Lord, this grace strengthened him and helped him to live a righteous life
These three great enemies continually meet together in the hall of our flesh, and their meeting is never dismissed
When we are matured, that is, when we are raptured, we will be able to turn to the flesh and say, 'Little flesh, your time is over
Before the maturity of life, in a sense we need the flesh, not to damage us, but to force us to come to the throne of grace
Consider the case of a particular husband who for years has been told by others that he should treat his wife better than he does
Since Noah had found grace, walked with God by faith, and inherited righteousness, God was very happy with him
While Noah was walking with God and God was happy with him, God opened His heart to Noah and revealed His secrets to him
People are lovers of money, lovers of self, and lovers of pleasure, just as the people described by Paul in 2 Timothy 3:1-3
God told Noah that the earth was filled with violence, that the end of all flesh was come and that He would destroy them with the earth
They go to the movies, to the night clubs, to the dance halls, to all kinds of amusements, pleasures, and sports
When Noah, his family, and the living creatures entered into the ark, people probably said, 'Look at those crazy persons
If you read the latter part of Genesis 1, you will see that God created man in His own image for the purpose of expressing Himself
On the second day, God did not say anything, because on that day there were fallen angels in the air and demons in the water
On the sixth day, the day in which God created man, God looked at His work, especially on man, and said, 'Very good'!
The answer, the same in principle throughout the centuries, is found in Genesis 6:8: 'But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord'
Satan was glad to hear that God was going to destroy man from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Although they degraded lower and lower until they reached the bottom, there was, much to the surprise of the enemy, a young man named Daniel
If we look at Noah's life, we shall see that it was not simply a matter of walking with God or of building the ark
If you read the Gospels and if you see God's purpose for the church, you will realize that the church has such a high commission
The present situation is sufficient to show us how much the church has fallen and deviated from God's proper goal
Although Genesis gives us a record of man's fall, that is only a background showing us the true picture of the godly ways
It is the way of Abel, which is to offer Christ to God, not only as the sacrifice for our sins, but also as a gift for pleasing God
The third godly way that Noah inherited was Enosh's way of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all that He is
It was not only a matter of being saved or of pleasing God, but of participating in and enjoying what God is by calling on His name
Although it is marvelous to see that a fallen man can be saved, we must further realize that such a person can walk with God
God gave Noah what was nearly an all-inclusive revelation, a further revelation which none of Noah's forefathers saw
As a result of this, Noah's view of godly things was greatly broadened, and he saw much more than all his forefathers did
Some dear ones have inherited all the godly ways of the saints from the first century of the Christian era until the present
Do you realize that most people, including many Christians, are not clear about the generation in which we live?
Ever since the day we received this revelation and stood up to declare it, we have been opposed, rejected, and condemned
While Noah told people what God had shown him and while he was building the ark, one hundred twenty years went by
If it does not come after fifty years, perhaps it will come after eighty years, or a hundred years, or a hundred nineteen years
Because of our firm testimony of the church according to God's revelation, a great deal of criticism and opposition have come out against us
Because this small man has brought something to this country that disturbs the enemy and threatens the kingdom of darkness
We all need to see this and build this ark to be todays Noah that we may terminate this generation and usher in the new age of the kingdom
Lee, if you would not have the church and just minister the Word, we all would invite you to speak in our churches
We appreciate the fact that you have given up your country, your family, your home, and everything to come here to preach the gospel
May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would be faithful to His revelation, not caring about being different from others
If you read the whole context of the Bible you will see that in Noahs day preaching righteousness was to protest against the evil generation
He did not construct it according to tradition or his own concept and invention, but absolutely according to God's revelation
In the Bible the number three firstly signifies the Triune God God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit
Some Christians, understanding the Trinity according to their mental apprehension, have come to believe in three gods
Although we cannot explain it adequately, we do have a verse in the Bible which says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit'
Ephesians 46 says that the Father is in us Colossians 127 says that Christ the Son is in us and John 1417 says that the Holy Spirit is in us
If a food is not cooked, at least it must pass through the process of being masticated, swallowed, digested, and assimilated
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The thought here, as signified by the numbers three and five, is that of the mingling of the Triune God with man
God's building is simply to build Himself into us, and us into Him, making Him one with us and making us one with Him
The basic numbers are three and five, and the numbers three hundred, fifty, and thirty are the multiples of these basic numbers
If you read Exodus 27, you will find that the numbers three and five are also the basic numbers of the tabernacle
According to our experience, the Spirit firstly came to us, found us, brought us to the Son, and inspired us to believe in the Son
Some may argue that there are twelve gates in the New Jerusalem, three gates on each of the four sides of the city
The ark made of gopher wood passed through the flood, and the flood attacked it again and again, but no damage was incurred
Christ is not only the crucified One, but also the One who shed His blood to cover us from the penalty of our sins
Death cannot damage Him, and so no condemnation or judgment can reach us, because we are under the covering of Christ's redemption
If you say that we must work to build the ark, the salvation, people will condemn you, saying, 'We are saved by grace, not by work'
Noah built the ark that eventually saved him not only from God's judgment, but also from that crooked and perverse generation
It was not simply a salvation from eternal perdition, but a salvation from that crooked and perverse generation
That kind of salvation was not only prepared by God; it was built through the corporate cooperation of the saved ones
Will you be there when Christ returns to take possession of the whole earth and to exercise His reigning power over it?
Although we all have been saved from eternal perdition, many of us are not working on something which will bring us out of this evil age
As far as God's judgment is concerned, we all have been saved, but as far as God's economy is concerned, we are lacking
The salvation mentioned in Philippians 2 is not salvation from perdition, but from the crooked and perverse generation
While the apostles were preaching the gospel, they were also building the ark in which they would enjoy full salvation
Through that corporate Christ thousands of people were not only saved from Gods judgment but also from that crooked and perverse generation
Although you might have been saved for many years, you were not separated from this crooked world until you came into the church
God's salvation to Noah was not only to save him from God's judgment, but also from his crooked, perverse, and evil generation
The evil nature of Satan which had been injected into man in the first fall developed into a godless human culture in the second fall
In the third fall of man, this culture ushered in an evil generation, producing a crooked, corrupted, and perverse generation
At the time of man's third fall, that evil power of darkness had corrupted the earth and filled it with violence
God's full salvation not only saves us from His condemnation, but also from the evil power and influence of this dark age
Later, when the New Testament age came, the first thing that transpired to open up this age was baptism with water
Their exodus from Egypt was not an escape from God's judgment; it was an escape from Egypt, a deliverance from the Egyptian slavery
Pharaoh, that is, Satan, seemed to say, 'You children of Israel have been saved from God's judgment and you have eaten the flesh of the lamb
Not from God's judgment, but from the power of Egypt and Pharaoh, that is, from the power of the world and Satan
When the Lord Jesus was about to go to the cross He declared Now is the judgment of this world now shall the ruler of this world be cast out
It is not a salvation from God's condemnation, but from the power of Satan and from the evil influence of this dark age
As a result of the two aspects of God's full salvation, Noah was saved from God's condemnation as well as from that evil generation
The Red Sea that God used to judge the Egyptians saved the children of Israel from the evil power of the Egyptians
Whenever we are going to baptize people, we must pray and exercise our spirit with authority and with the powerful name of the Lord Jesus
The flood waters that judged Noah's generation rescued him, and the Red Sea that judged the Egyptians rescued the Israelites
All the worldly occupations, all the worldly pleasures, amusements, sports, are buried in the Red Sea of our baptism
In addition to the types which typify baptism, we have the signs in the Bible which signify the meaning of baptism
Suppose a person was coming out of the world and wanted to be a priest and get into the presence of God within the tabernacle
Many Christians think that after passing through the altar he could have immediately entered into the holy place within the tabernacle
In other words, their sins have been dealt with on the cross, but their world has not been buried beneath the Red Sea
You cannot enter into the presence of God until you pass through the true meaning of baptism, that is, to bury the world
They sing two kinds of songs the song of Moses, which was first sung at the shore of the Red Sea, and the song of the Lamb
The entire creation will pass through baptism, and the oldness will be burned and washed by the burning fire into the lake of fire
Eventually, the new heaven and the new earth, the new creation, will be brought to the presence of God, and the New Jerusalem will descend
Everything else will be in the presence of the very God who will take the New Jerusalem as His eternal habitation
Every baptism is a picture showing us how all the negative things buried in the baptistery will flow into the lake of fire
The civil calendar was the old one, and the sacred calendar was the new one, which began from the first Passover
When God told the Israelites to have the Passover, He told them that that month had to be counted as the first month of the year
In that early type of the ark resting upon the mountain, we were told the exact date of the resurrection of Christ
When the ark rested upon the mountaintop, the eight persons also were resurrected and rested on the mountaintop in the ark
If we look at the picture of the type, we shall see that the church is another community; it is not the old society
In addition to all the other seeds sown in the book of Genesis, the seed of the church life is also sown there
When he was confined in the ark, he had no opportunity to eat carcasses, because there was no death in the ark
One day, when there is the opportunity to get out, the ravens will fly away and begin to feed on the carcasses
They were in the church life for awhile, but went out to contact the world that was judged by God and began to feed on the carcasses
If we are going to have a church in a certain city, we should send one or two 'doves' to see whether or not there is some fresh olive leaf
If the water has abated and some olive trees have come up with fresh leaves, that may be a sign that the church should be there
The first thing in the church life should not be work; it must be the offering of Christ to God through the cross
If a young man wants to obey the commandment to honor his parents, he should first let the cross cross him out
We all must be crossed out at the altar that we may offer the Christ whom we have experienced in our daily life
We are being crossed out and also are experiencing Christ, bringing Him to God, and sharing Him with one another in the presence of God
Once you have been crossed out on the cross and have experienced Christ in a full way, you will be filled, happy, and satisfied
Without the experience of Christ through the cross, we would be under the curse of death, murmuring, gossiping, criticizing, and complaining
We who are used to the church life are truly under God's blessing, not only spiritually and mentally, but even physically
God created man in His own image that he might express Him, and He committed man with His dominion that he might represent Him
In the church life, we have been brought back to God's original goal, which is that man express and represent Him
Do not pray to the Lord, who has the authority and the sovereignty over the whole universe, in a pitiful, begging way
By prayer, we should express our attitude, saying, 'We do not agree with the evil things that are happening in this country'
Not only at the time of creation, but also at the time of resurrection, all living things were destined to be under man's authority
They were not destined to be under the authority of the fallen man, but under the authority of the resurrected man
We all must rise up and tell the enemy that we disagree with his evil deeds and that he must stay away from us
We must exercise authority and tell the enemy that we do not agree with such disturbances and will not allow them to happen
Since we do not share their background, it is difficult for us to understand their feelings upon leaving the ark
After coming out of the ark, you would still have been fearful, thinking that after awhile the flood might come again
Two weeks ago their sky was clear, but suddenly there was thunder and a great downpour that was the loss of the temper
If your wife or husband has been so pleasant for two weeks and suddenly the sky becomes cloudy, do not believe it
According to the record of Genesis, Noah had become the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind on the earth
The priests were not allowed to be naked; they had to be fully covered when they came into the presence of God
To be naked spiritually speaking means to lose your covering in the presence of God, that is, to lose Christ as your covering
We all must be careful not to be excited to the degree that we become loose, careless, drunken, naked, and lose the proper covering
Perhaps we were even talking about a high church meeting, but we talked about it in a naked way without the covering of Christ
As fallen human beings, we must keep ourselves covered by Christ in every kind of activity, in everything that we do or say
If you do not learn sufficiently when you are young, you will feel that you lack certain knowledge when you become old
Since God had established him as the leader, he had to speak, not according to his convictions, but according to God's government
It would have been all right for Noah to make such a confession, but it would have meant the ruin of God's government on earth
Sometimes when the leaders in the church fell into this kind of situation, they gave up and did not say anything
Whether you receive a curse or a blessing from such a test depends on how you involve yourself with God's government
Noah's looseness, carelessness, drunkenness, and nakedness were all due to the work of the Devil through the flesh
It is not a matter of whether the leader is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not you are under God's government
It is not a matter of whether Noah was right or wrong; it is all a matter of from where we have received our being
Many nations follow the European way of government because the Europeans were strong in this matter, learning it from the Romans
All the things concerning God, concerning God's gospel, concerning Christ, and concerning salvation have come out of the Jews
The descendants of Shem did not build Babylon; they built tents like Abraham did and they built the tabernacle for God
The descendants of Japheth, the Europeans, including the Americans, truly have dwelt in Shem's tents of salvation
In those messages we saw how the ark made by Noah passed through the water and ushered Noah and his family into a new age
According to typology, at that time Noah and his family were living in resurrection, and that kind of living was a shadow of the church life
At the beginning of the new age of life in resurrection, there was only one deputy head, Noah, who represented God, the true Head
The seeds sown in the book of Genesis develop in the remaining books of the Bible, becoming a harvest in the book of Revelation
The seed of division is sown in Genesis 10, grows in the New Testament Epistles, and becomes a harvest in the book of Revelation
Although they were one because the family element held them together, the main factor of their oneness was their one God
The main factor that preserved the oneness of the new race was that they had no God other than the one, true God
As the church, we have returned to God's original purpose, to the purpose He had in the beginning that man express Him and represent Him
Unless you stand in the position of representing God, your conscience will not allow you to utter such a prayer
Once you stand in the position of representing God, your conscience will confirm and strengthen you to say, 'Lord, we give You the command
As long as we go back to the beginning, to God's original purpose that man express Him and represent Him, we are spontaneously one
They were divided because they began to have different worships and because they had different goals, interests, and purposes
Although we may not be in the same family according to the flesh, we may have a fleshly relationship nonetheless
Perhaps you love a certain brother because he is the kind of person that you love, yet you may not love other kinds of people
We have families because of our fleshly interests and we have languages because of different concepts and utterances
At a certain time some of those saints took in different concepts and began to speak differently; they began to talk a different language
They were strict about this, saying to those who encroached upon their territory, 'Why do you come to our territory to preach?
People are talking about the local church, and many are proclaiming that they are the local church in their locality
When people say, 'Don't bother us we are the local church in this locality,' in God's sight they are a local sect, not a local church
Once you have become a fleshly family, you will have an opinionated language and a divisive way of dividing the land
The most we can say is the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, the church in Anaheim, etc
We wish to ask you why, since you have been preaching against the denominations, you yourself have formed another denomination'?
After those ten days, all the elders felt that we should contact some of the leading free groups in the city of Taipei
There were at least two or three groups claiming to be nonsectarian or nondenominational, simply meeting in the name of the Lord
At first, we sent two or three elders to visit these groups to have a thorough talk with them regarding the unity among the saints
Years ago, in some of the so-called Wesleyan churches they had an 'amen corner,' and anyone who wanted to say amen had to sit there
Others argue about the type of water used whether it should be hot or cold salt or fresh in a manmade pool or in a natural lake river or sea
Regarding the matter of the Trinity, according to the Bible we believe in the one God, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
As the Father is a person, the Son is a person, and the Spirit is a person, so God Himself must also be a person
How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore'
All the nations in ancient times issued in Babel, and all the denominations in Christianity eventually will consummate in the great Babylon
Cush, the builder of Babel, was Ham's son, and Nimrod, the son of Cush, became the first king over the kingdom of Babel
The denominational organizations have been utilized by Satan to set up his satanic system to destroy God's economy of the proper church life
The same emblem of a mother embracing her child is found in the Catholic cathedrals and in the Buddhist idol temples
We have already seen that, after the flood, Noah and his family lived a life in resurrection and that such a life was a shadow of the church
After the flood, when in resurrection man lived on the earth in a new way, God established a deputy authority on earth
After Noah became the head of a new race, God gave him authority not only over creatures other than man, but also over man
The ruling with God-given authority among men on the new earth signifies the reigning of God's kingdom in resurrection life
Under the ruling of God's deputy authority, which was a shadow of the kingdom of God, the situation was different
In that kingdom, man was recovered back to the purpose that God had for man at the beginning: to express and represent God
After the flood man was brought back to the beginning to fulfill God's purpose, to have the one goal of expressing God and representing Him
When we come to the end of the Bible, we see that the kingdom will result in a very unpleasant situation in a great rebellion
How good it was that Noah enjoyed peace in the kingdom and that mankind was recovered back to the beginning to fulfill God's purpose
Satan caused man to misuse his authority, using it to form nations and to establish little empires for man himself
If you have been saved washed and regenerated for the church it means that you have experienced these things for the reality of the kingdom
Later, in the house of Cornelius , he used the second key, the key that opened the door for the Gentiles to come into the kingdom
You would have to return the extra change, for the heavenly ruling over you and within you would not allow you to take advantage of others
Because our yielding to the heavenly ruling is not yet adequate, some sisters need to be ruled over by their husbands
Because many sisters are still so natural, not really living by Christ or walking in the spirit, they need to be ruled by their husbands
In the schools, in the stores, in the homes, and in every other place, the heavenly ruling of God will be more than adequate
While the realization, the inward reality, of the kingdom is in the church today, the outward manifestation will come in the future
If you are in the reality of the kingdom, you will return extra change when it is given to you by a cashier in a store or restaurant
When the Lord comes in the outward way and brings in the manifestation of the kingdom, there will be no need for any further explanation
According to the book of Numbers, those who were over the age of twenty and under the age of fifty were the fighters
Thank the Lord that we also have some younger ones, the ones who are spiritually under twenty; they are the young enjoyers
The church is producing the strong ones, the overcomers, who will fight the battle against Satan, God's enemy, and against his world
According to Revelation 12, when the overcomers are caught up into heaven, Satan will be cast down to the earth
The church produces the overcomers, and the overcomers defeat the enemy and usher in the manifestation of the kingdom
Suppose the elders among us assume their position, exercising authority to rule over others in the church life
We all must learn that in the church, where the reality of the kingdom is, we must behave ourselves in our spirit
If he lives in the spirit, the Spirit of God will tell everyone that this is the head and that they must submit to him
Not only the Holy Spirit within us but even the little ones in our homes know whether we are in the flesh or in the spirit
When we are in the spirit, we are under the heavenly ruling, and spontaneously this ruling is exercised over the entire situation
Do you really believe that in resurrection you will be Christ's co-kings reigning with Him over all the nations?
We need to live in the spirit, walk in the spirit, be dealt with in our natural life, and always stay in resurrection
Can you believe that after a thousand years of heavenly ruling under the kingship of Christ in restoration there could be such a rebellion?
Now we need to be in resurrection and to live and walk according to the spirit that we may have the reality of the kingdom among us
Although God's economy has so many positive things in white, it needs some negative things in black to show the whiteness of the white
In the next eight and a half chapters, from Genesis 3 to the middle of Genesis 11, we find the record of man's four falls
He did everything within his limit that he could possibly do, using every available means to bring about man's fourth fall
Although there was a small element of rebellion in the first fall, that fall was not a rebellion; it was mostly a fall
Originally, man's spirit was under God's presence, his soul was under his spirit, and his body was under his soul
The element of the conscience was present in man, but its function was not in use until man had been seduced by Satan and had fallen
When that fall transpired, the conscience began to function immediately, and Adam and Eve realized that they were naked
If we have a genuine, good, clean conscience, it will always cause us to be ashamed whenever we do something unclean or immoral
The first dispensation was that of God's divine government, and the second was that of the government of man's own conscience
When man fell from the rule of his conscience, he came under the third dispensation, that of the human government
We have many deputy authorities: the parents at home, the principals and teachers in the schools, and the government
Humanly speaking, we all must have a fear of God, we all must listen to our conscience, and we all must respect God's deputy authority
In God's salvation we are firstly saved from rebellion to human government and from human government to the conscience
Satan utilized the authority which God gave man to form nations and to instigate a rebellion against God with the nations
At the rebellion at Babel, man declared that he denied God's right and that he was absolutely free from God's authority
They claimed that they were the owners, that authority was theirs, and that they would do whatever they wanted to do
As we have seen, the issue was a matter of who would have the right in this universe, of who would have authority on earth
If you read the story of Cain in Genesis 4, you will see that he was a man who was one hundred percent in the soul
Man neglected the spirit; secondly, he acted by the soul; and thirdly, he lived and walked absolutely according to the flesh
On the one hand, He gave up the Adamic race, but on the other hand, He called a man out of that fallen race to have a new beginning
It is, for the sake of man's building, to kill, to burn, every bit of the element in the earth that grows life
If you have the insight, you will realize that today every society, every human culture, is burning the earth into bricks
Today's society is built up with bricks made by men who burn the element that grows life out of the earth created by God
Every organization in today's society is burning the earth into bricks and building up a Babel that is godless and lifeless
The church is not building up a lifeless and godless city; it is building up a city that is godly and full of life
Not only in secular society but even to some degree in socalled Christian society in Christianity people are burning the earth into bricks
They are burning to death the element that grows life in order to build up a city that is godless and lifeless
The first result of man's fourth fall was that mankind was scattered in living, no longer able to live together in one place
In the church we should not have different kinds of speaking, because in the church we should have only one mind
In Romans 15:5-6, 1 Corinthians 1:10, and Philippians 2:2, the Apostle Paul charged the believers to be of one mind
Some people criticize us severely, saying that all the local churches are the same, speak the same thing, and have the same concept
If in the church in Anaheim we have different thoughts and opinions, that is a sign that the curse has come upon us
The sharpest one is the person who receives the blessing, and receiving the blessing depends upon our speaking the same thing
If you visit the church in Hong Kong today and the church in Tokyo tomorrow, you will be surprised to hear them speaking the same thing
The first section covers God's creation, the second covers the serpent's corruption of mankind, and the third covers Jehovah's calling
According to the revelation of the Bible, Elohim, the Hebrew word for God in 1:1, is a title that mainly relates to God's creation
Since the name Jesus includes Jehovah, we may say that Jesus is the New Testament Jehovah and that Jehovah was the Old Testament Jesus
Because of the fall, our relationship with God the Father is sweeter and more meaningful than it would have been without the fall
The thirty-nine and a half chapters that compose the third section of Genesis are a brief of the entire New Testament
As we have pointed out on other occasions, the New Testament begins with the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom
When Jehovah came in to call Abraham in Genesis 12, He gave him a promise, and that promise was the preaching of the gospel
In God's preaching of His gospel to Abraham, He promised the called ones that He would give Himself to them as a blessing
When God revealed Himself to Moses, He said, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
The New Testament is simply an autobiography of the Triune God of the Father in Abraham, the Son in Isaac, and the Spirit in Jacob
When God called Abraham, in a sense He called a corporate man, but, in another sense, He called a single person
Although all of the descendants of Adam were created in Adam, we cannot say that all the descendants of Abraham were called in Abraham
Although it appears so outwardly actually this is not the case for Romans 978 says that not all the seed of Abraham are the children of God
Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, as long as we have had a new beginning by faith in Christ, we are Abraham's seed
At the time of His calling of Abraham, God began to have a new beginning, and now we all have entered into this new beginning through faith
When we say that God's calling is a new beginning, we must understand that this new beginning is a transfer of race
Although we were born in a particular race at the time of our calling we were transferred into another race the new race of the called ones
Although you can boldly declare that you have undergone the transfer of race, can you say that you have experienced the transfer of life?
Due to the fall of man, all of God's original creation became old and is no longer able to fulfill God's purpose
The transfer of life in God's calling is from the fallen life of the old creation to this stronger and better life of the new creation
He had the new beginning, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life, which was a great problem to both him and God
God rejected Eliezer saying to Abraham This shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
The wife was the one who made the proposal and eventually she was the one who was troubled by the result of her proposal
Your name shall be changed from Abram, which means an exalted father, to Abraham, which means the father of a great multitude
What he had Eliezer and what he intended to keep Ishmael were all rejected, and his natural ability was terminated
When 'the time of life' came, Isaac was born of these two dead ones, as if it was by the power of resurrection
Probably, some of us still cling to Eliezer, some want to hold on to Ishmael, and some have been fully disappointed
Laban thought that Jacob was helping him with his flocks, but while Jacob was helping Laban, he made a flock for himself
Although it took God a long time to accomplish this, at a certain time He told Jacob that his name was being changed from Jacob to Israel
With the believers, the transfer of life is accomplished by the experience of circumcision, by the putting off of the flesh
All that God promised to Abraham will be the blessings of the New Testament gospel in which we all shall participate through faith in Christ
Although Genesis is a long book, it has only three sections: God's creation , the serpent's corruption , and Jehovah's calling
Although you have been called out of the old race, the nature and life of the old race still remain in you, and you still live by that life
His lameness was a sign that he had been touched by God that his natural strength had been dealt with and that he had become a prince of God
If you say that you have been called, then you must come out of Chaldea, Babel, the old race, and your natural life
Although at times the process of this transfer is not pleasant, after awhile you can see in the saints the real transfer of life
Man had forsaken God, had exalted himself, had denied God's right and authority, and had turned from God to serve idols
Although God's calling is carried out in time, something prior to that God's selection took place in eternity past
One day, in time, while Abraham was worshipping other gods, having no forethought that he was to be called by God, God visited him
If we study the Bible carefully, we shall see that, in Ur of the Chaldees, God did not appear to Abraham's father but to Abraham
Abraham however did not accept that calling immediately and God sovereignly caused his father Terah to bring the family from Ur to Haran
In the second calling at Haran, God called Abraham out of his country, his kindred, and also out of his father's house
At the time of God's second calling, however, He told him not only to leave his country and kindred but also his father's house
As you read the book of Genesis, you will notice that the records of Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah are quite distinct one from another
The significance of this overlapping is that, according to the experience of life, these three persons are one man, a corporate man
The God who came to call this corporate person and who dealt with this corporate man was the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
When God spoke to Moses out of the burning bush He said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
A son is one who comes out of the father, who inherits all that the father is and has, and who accomplishes all that the father desires
He was out of the father, he inherited everything of the father, and he worked to accomplish his father's purpose
The Lord Jesus as the Son of God came out of the Father inherited all that the Father is and has and accomplished all the Fathers will
The Triune God considered them as members of a corporate man for His dealings and for Him to be their God in this way
The last thirty-nine and a half chapters of Genesis are a biography of a corporate person composed of three plus one
Abraham had a good beginning with being called, but there is no record of his being chosen or of his reaching an ultimate and matured end
Do you believe that, according to the record of Genesis, Abraham attained to the highest and consummate maturity of life?
Although Abraham was high in the life of faith, we do not see in him the maturity of life that we see in Jacob
By this we can see that, according to experience, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not individuals but three members of the whole Body
Isaac needed the beginning of both Abraham's and Jacob's experiences and the end of Jacob's experience for his completion
Although there are so many good ones, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, in the book of Genesis, no one is as mature as Jacob
If we add together the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we have a clear portrait of the complete experience of the called one
While Jacob was a prince of God, Joseph was the one who reigned over the world, reigning over all the earth for Jacob
We need You to regenerate us, to discipline us, to transform us, and to make us grow that we might mature in life
Our Triune God, how we bow to You, worship You, praise You, and thank You for all that You have done to us and in us'!
According to our traditional background, everyone ranks Abraham at the top, thinking that he exceeds everybody else
How wonderful it is to realize the Son's redeeming, saving, bringing us into the inheritance, and accomplishing of God's eternal purpose
How excellent it is to experience the Spirit's regenerating, disciplining, transforming, and causing us to grow and mature
In the last message we saw that the Triune God dealt with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as one complete corporate man
Abraham's dwelling place was not only in a place full of demons but also in a place that was enclosed by two great rivers
It was very difficult for him or any other person to leave such a place, for the demons held him and the great rivers enclosed him
Many of the students are little demons selling drugs and trying to hold you back, saying, 'How can you be different from us?
Behind Sarah there might have been many demons, and these demons would not agree with Abraham's getting out of Chaldea
It was neither an angel nor a dignified person who appeared to Abraham but the God of glory Himself who appeared to him
Although we might forget the day or even the year when we were saved, we can never forget the time that, deep within, we saw Jesus
Many of us can testify that at the time we were saved, deep within us we had the consciousness that Jesus was speaking to us
With others, the Lord Jesus has spoken in a different way, saying, 'Look at how sinful you are, at how bad and poor you are'!
Many of us have heard words such as these, not out of the mouth of a preacher but out of the mouth of the living Jesus
Do you recall the kind of speaking you heard from the living Jesus when He appeared to you at the time you were called and saved?
The non-Christians, including the professing Christians, have not had this kind of experience and they consider it as superstition
He might even say I dont believe in Jesus anymore but deep within the Lord says How can you say that you dont believe in Me anymore
A genuine Christian has, at least once, heard the speaking of Jesus by the living Spirit directly in the depths of his being
God told Abraham to get out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house, unto a land that He would show him
Since the Spirit is God Himself, this means that God promised that He would give Himself to Abraham as the blessing
In His promise, God made another turn from Abraham back to all the families of the Adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham
God turned from Adam to Abraham and, eventually, He turned from Abraham through Christ back to the created race
Since the United States is helping the nation of Israel today, surely the United States is under God's blessing
In the gospel, after we repent for the kingdom, we need to believe that we may have eternal life, which is in the Spirit
The blessing promised to Abraham, which, according to Galatians 3:14, is the promise of the Spirit, is the very blessing of the gospel
A nation is a matter of dominion to represent God, and blessing is a matter of image in the Spirit to express God
Some may ask why 1:26, 28 mention expressing God with His image first and representing Him with His dominion second
In God's original purpose, it was image and dominion, but, due to the fall, in the gospel the order is reversed
The appearance of the wall and of the entire city of New Jerusalem will be the same as God's appearance jasper
After we were saved, most of us met some mistaken preachers who told us many wrong things that distracted us from God's purpose
Praise the Lord that in God's recovery He has recovered us to His original purpose and He has brought us back to the beginning
Although it is easy to talk about river crossing, it is not easy to have the real river crossing according to the experience of Abraham
We may do this with respect to the calling of Abraham, for his calling is mentioned in both Genesis 12 and Acts 7
By these two verses we see that God appeared to Abraham in two different places: at Ur of Chaldea and at Haran
When God called Abraham the second time, He not only mentioned Abraham's kindred in a general way but his father's house in a particular way
Perhaps some of you reading this message still hold on to the concept that Acts 7 is a quotation of Genesis 12
The call in Acts 7 occurred before Abraham was brought to Haran, and the call in Genesis 12 happened after he had lived there for a time
Although you might have received the calling from God, you allow your relatives to be the mud through which you drag your feet
While Saul of Tarsus was on the way to Damascus to persecute the Christians there, a light from heaven shone upon him
You saw that your place, your environment and surroundings, was not the right place for you to stay any longer
He might have told his father Terah and his relatives how God had appeared to him and had told him to get out of his country and his kindred
In 11:28 we are told that 'Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees'
Abraham's delay in answering God's calling caused two deaths, the death of his brother at Ur and the death of his father at Haran
Your dear relatives, whom you love so much and whom you would take with you in answering God's calling, are always veils to you
When we come to Genesis 13, we shall see that Lot caused a great deal of trouble to Abraham and that eventually he had to leave Abraham
To be saved means to be called out of your background, to be called out of your present surroundings, environment, and situation
To be saved is not merely a matter of having your sins forgiven, of being rescued from hell, and of being qualified to go to heaven
Pilgrim's Progress, a very famous book written by John Bunyan, stresses the one point that salvation is a journey
Before Genesis 15, however, we have at least three chapters telling us that this justified one was on a journey
On the road to Damascus, the Lord appeared to him, shined upon him, and called him, and Saul's Chaldea became 'Ur,' the place of light
The Lord called Saul out of that religion in order that he might enter into Christ, God's new covenant economy, the church, and the kingdom
God is going to leave heaven and dwell in the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the church, for eternity
In His calling, God told him definitely what he had to leave, but God did not tell him clearly where he had to go
According to Acts 7:4, it was not Abraham who entered into the good land but God who removed him into the land
Although Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham went out by faith, Acts 7:4 says that God removed him from Haran into Canaan
After crossing the river, he sojourned through the land, traveling southward until he reached a place called Shechem
After that time you wandered, journeyed, and traveled from place to place without having another appearing of God
Many of us can testify that after we were saved we traveled through Christianity without having God's reappearing
It was not until we came to today's Shechem with the oak of Moreh, that is, the church life, that the inner appearing rose up once again
Many of us can testify that after we came to the church we had the feeling that God had appeared to us again telling us This is the place
At Shechem, Abraham did not build anything to make himself a name; he built an altar for calling on the name of the Lord
We all can testify that we never called on the name of the Lord as much as we have since coming into the church life
We, the believers, are the true descendants of Abraham, and he is the true father of everyone who has been called by God
As we read all of the chapters in Genesis about Abraham, we must read them in the way of realizing that his story is our story
In principle, the seed is on a small scale, the growth is on a greater scale, and the harvest is on the greatest scale
The Christian workers and the leading brothers must have the faith never to be disappointed with the brothers and sisters
His living was an anti-testimony to the way of the humankind, to the way that had been fully developed at Babel
Although God's first appearing is initiated by Him and does not depend upon us, the subsequent appearings depend upon our condition
If Abraham had not arrived at Moreh, he would not have had God's reappearing, the reappearing that strengthened him to go on with God
Why do you go there on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, twice on Sunday, and even sometimes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday?
Although we did not realize what it meant at the time, we promised the Lord that everything we had was for Him
We all can testify how sweet is the sensation and how intimate is the fellowship whenever we tell the Lord that everything is for Him
It is not teaching that causes people to consecrate themselves to the Lord; it is the Lord's appearing that motivates them to do this
Between the house of God and the heap of ruins we build an altar that we might fellowship with God, worship Him, and serve Him
We all need to build at least three altars: the first at Moreh, the second between Bethel and Ai, and the third at Mamre in Hebron
We need to build an altar at Mamre in Hebron so that we may worship God, serve Him, and have constant fellowship with Him
With Abraham, the primary matter was to consecrate everything to God, to worship and serve God, and to have fellowship with God
That was the place where God's house was and where he began his testimony in expressing God by fellowshipping with Him
His altar was the beginning of his testimony for God to the world, whereas his tent was the completion of his testimony to the world for God
His tent was a miniature of the tabernacle built by his descendants in the wilderness, which was called the 'tabernacle of testimony'
Since his tent was pitched by Bethel, in a sense it may be considered as the house of God for God's testimony on earth
His tent firstly was a testimony for God to the world and then it became the center where he had fellowship with God
When Abraham was feasting with God in his tent, he was the high priest, and the inner part of his tent was the Holy of Holies
We can say to the worldly people, 'You have everything, but there is one thing that you don't have God's presence
When we have a tent with God's presence, we have the deep sensation within that nothing here on earth is lasting
Hebrews 11:10 says that Abraham 'waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God'
While Abraham was living in a tent without any foundations, he was looking and waiting for a city with foundations
Abraham's tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate tabernacle of God in the universe
While he was living there with God, he was waiting for a city, a city that eventually will be the New Jerusalem
Although God had told him that He would give the land to Abraham and his descendants, Abraham did not care for that
We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God's appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call
We have also seen that, by God's appearing, Abraham was brought to the very place where God intended him to be
He was brought to Shechem and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins
That place between the house of God and the heap of ruins was the high point, and Abraham should have remained there
Suddenly, after such a high attainment in his experience of God, Abraham continued his journey, going toward the south
The night before you said, 'Hallelujah, this is the place for me,' and the next morning you began to journey downward to the border of Egypt
One night you were on the high point in Canaan and the next morning you were moving downward to the border of the world
Today you may say, 'Hallelujah, this is the best place for me,' and next weekend you may move downward to the movie theater
Although you may consider yourself a small creature, as far as God is concerned, you are a very important person
As far as God's keeping grace was concerned, Abraham was still on the high point even when he was selling his wife in Egypt
Even if you have fallen, you are still in the keeping grace, and the keeping grace will bring you back to the high point
By this one experience in Egypt Abraham learned that the God who called him also took care of him and that everything was in His hand
Through this experience Abraham was disciplined not only to trust in God but to know that God is real and faithful
As long as you are one of God's called ones, He will take care of you whether or not you believe in Him or trust in Him
When Abraham was planning to sell his wife, God was preparing to bless him, preserve his life, and give him many riches
When Abraham was planning to sell his wife in Egypt, there was no altar, tent, or calling on the name of the Lord
Abraham came back to the beginning, to the place of the altar, and there he recovered his calling on the name of the Lord
If you say this, you may soon find yourself in trouble, for the second trial will come from the blessing of the first trial
Abraham learned the lesson of not striving for himself and of having no choice for himself but of trusting in God's care
Lot made his choice, departed from Abraham, and 'pitched his tent toward Sodom,' not caring about the wickedness of Sodom
In Egypt, God dealt with Pharaoh in the plagues, but He did not appear to Abraham because he was in the wrong position
Now in chapter thirteen Abraham was not only in Gods keeping grace but having come back to the original place was also in the right position
He removed his tent and came to dwell in Hebron where he dwelt for most of the remainder of his time in the fellowship with God
The events in chapter fourteen, however, are not just related to international affairs but are sovereignly related to God's people
In the land of Canaan at that time, there were only two families of the Hebrew race the family of Abraham and the family of Lot
If you had been there and had separated yourself from him, it would have been equal to separating yourself from God's mark
The first defeat occurred when Lot's herdmen were striving against Abraham's herdmen and Abraham offered Lot the choice of the land
On the contrary, when Abraham gave him his choice, immediately, without much consideration, Lot made his choice and went his way
The four kings had captured Sodom and all of its food supply, but one person who escaped told Abraham that Lot had been captured
Unlike us, Abraham did not count the weak point of his brother and did not take pleasure in Lot's suffering and calamity
The four kings must have had several armies, the number of men in which must have been much greater than the number of Abraham's men
Abraham had been called by God, and he answered that calling by coming forward to the very land that God intended to give him
All he had was a little experience in answering God's calling and coming forward to the place where God intended him to be
As we saw in the last message, a famine arose as a test to Abraham, and he was not able to withstand that test
When the problem arose with Lot, Abraham didn't take his own choice; he knew that his choice was in the hands of God
When Melchisedec appeared, two special titles of God are revealed: the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth
Abraham said, 'I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth'
Although his capture was a warning to him not to return to Sodom, he still went back, even after his capture and rescue
How was it possible for one who escaped to have come to Abraham, and how could Abraham have made such a brief and bold decision?
Do you not believe that before Melchisedec came to minister bread and wine, as the priest of God he was interceding for Lot and Abraham?
In answer to his intercession one escaped from Sodom told Abraham the news and Abraham made the bold decision to fight for the rescue of Lot
After we have finished our slaughter of the kings, our Melchisedec will come to us, meet with us, and celebrate our victory
Christ will be made manifest by our slaughter of the kings, and the whole world will be surprised at His coming
To us, the overcomers, Christ's second appearing will not be a surprise, but to the worldly people it will be a great surprise
We may answer, 'His name is Christ, the real Melchisedec, and He comes from the heavens where He has been interceding for centuries'
If we go according to that echoing forgetting our environment enemies and even ourselves we shall gain the victory and slaughter the kings
In our experience of Christ, we shall realize that our God is the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth
Abraham told the king of Sodom that, before he went to war, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God, to the Possessor of heaven and earth
Since Abraham had full confidence in the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, he had to be victorious
When Melchisedec came to Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
Our victory gains the spoils, and the offering of our spoils to Christ always declares the greatness of Christ
Melchisedec, the priest of the Most High God, was there, granting Abraham the blessing and receiving tithes from him
Even the people who had been captured and brought back by Abraham wondered whose people they would be from then on
Abraham said, 'I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth'
Abraham said that his fighters and confederates should have their portion but that he would give his portion to the king of Sodom
Can you believe that one who was so high could have been so low as to plan to sacrifice his wife for his living?
When Abraham was willing to sell his wife, he was in the lowest hell, but when he dealt with the kings, he was in the highest heaven
Abraham's victory and his being higher than the kings were absolutely due to the intercession behind the scene
The first trial that he faced in living by faith was a grievous famine through which he learned to trust God in the matter of eating
In the Bible and in human history, many times God exercised His control over the human race through this matter of eating
These herdsmen were fighting for their bread and butter, striving with one another for the sake of a better living
Abraham was victorious in the second trial, having learned in the first trial that God was sovereign in his daily life
He did not need to take care of his own bread and butter, for he had learned that the One who had called him would take care of this for him
Abraham was not afraid of those four kings but went out boldly and fought against them, slaughtering them and recovering the food supply
All of Abraham's experiences up to the end of chapter fourteen were outward, being concerned with outward blessing, care, and supply
Before hearing this, you might have thought that at the end of chapter fourteen Abraham must have been on the peak of his experience of God
After his slaughter of the kings, a strong enmity had been created between him and the people who belonged to those kings
When we are in faith, we are bold, saying, 'Hallelujah to the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
He left Haran, where he had been called the second time, taking Lot along with him, and passed through Damascus where he picked up Eliezer
The Lord said to Abraham, 'This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir'
The Lord said to him Look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him So shall thy seed be
Abraham tried to make this an outward matter, for Eliezer was something outside of him, not something out of him
Some may argue with this, saying, 'Don't they have justification by faith, and is this not in chapter fifteen'?
Abraham was not justified by faith in chapter fourteen when he believed that God was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
Believing that God will supply our daily needs, our daily food, is good, but it is not the kind of faith that is precious in the eyes of God
Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things
None of these things, however, had anything to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose but were only related to Abraham's existence
God's purpose is to have a people to express Him with His image, represent Him with His dominion, and take the earth for His kingdom
Everything that had happened to Abraham prior to Genesis 15 had nothing to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose
Many are still hoping that the Lord will give them a better job, a good husband or wife, a good education, or an excellent promotion
While all of these things may enable you to exist, they have nothing to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose
Although God had given Abraham a great deal, nothing that he had was useful for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Our education, jobs, and houses are all good for our existence, but none of them are good for the fulfilling of God's purpose
As we have seen, His purpose is to have a people in His image to express Himself and with His dominion to represent Himself
The seed that was needed for the fulfillment of God's purpose had to be what God promised to work out through Abraham
All of these things are just Eliezers, things which are not what the Lord has wrought into us to bring forth Christ, the seed
Perhaps even in the church life you might still be trusting in this Eliezer, meaning that you still trust in your college education
The Lord told Paul that he had to forget all of those things they were dung, garbage, dog food and to cast them aside
The Lord seemed to tell Paul, 'The things that you had from your religious background can never bring forth Christ
Many Christians, using the adjective form of the word grace, are fond of saying, 'Oh, how gracious God is to us'
The Hebrew word for gracious in Numbers 6:25 means to bend or to stoop oneself in order to be kind to an inferior person
Full of grace and reality,' and John 1:16 tells us that 'of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace'
The Gospel of John does not say that the Word became flesh full of blessing, or that blessing came with Christ
Revelation 22:21 does not say, 'The blessing of the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, be with you all'
Abraham believed in the Lord according to His word, and the Lord counted his believing to him for righteousness
Although this is the New Testament age many Christians still live in the Old Testament dispensation caring only for blessings not for grace
During Abraham's time, the land was a place in which Abraham could defeat all of his enemies in order that God might have a kingdom on earth
Eventually, in the land, the kingdom of God was established, the temple was built for God's habitation, and the glory of God was manifested
It was one thing for Abraham to exist; it was another thing for him to have the seed and the land for the fulfillment of God's purpose
To them, Christ is not the land for them to live in and to live on; neither is He the land for them to slaughter all their enemies
If we see this, then we know how greatly most Christians have missed the mark in seeking only for God's blessings
We do not need to pay that much attention to our existence or to be so concerned about Gods blessings because our Father knows what we need
Eliezer was what Abraham had and Ishmael was what Abraham could do, and neither of them counted for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Before coming into the church, it was difficult for us to defeat any of our enemies, but after coming into the church, it was so easy
In the last message we saw that whatever Abraham experienced prior to Genesis 15 was a matter of God's blessing for his existence
God's calling of Abraham was not merely that Abraham should exist; it was that God's eternal purpose might be fulfilled through him
Beginning with chapter fifteen, God came in to show Abraham that he needed grace for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
As we saw in the previous message, two things were needed for Abraham to fulfill God's purpose the seed and the land
If you read Genesis 15 again, you will see that these two things, the seed and the land, are mentioned repeatedly
In Christ, God establishes His kingdom and builds His habitation, the church, for His expression and representation
At that time Abraham was justified by faith by the faith that believed that God would give him the seed to accomplish Gods eternal purpose
Although he was able to believe in God for the promise concerning the seed, he could not believe in Him for the promise concerning the land
Many Christians seem to be saying, 'It is possible for us to live by Christ, but it is impossible to have the church life'
Years ago, before we came into the church life, we ministered on the matter of living by Christ, but we ourselves were not in the rest
Because Abraham found it difficult to believe in God regarding the promise of the land, God was forced to make a covenant with him
If Abraham had immediately believed in God for the promise of the land, Genesis 15 would have been much shorter than it is now
It was not the time of sunrise but of sunset, and God did not come in a lovely way but as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch
In making His covenant with Abraham, God told him to take a heifer, a she-goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon
The three cattle, all of which were three years of age, were divided in half, but the two birds were not; they were kept alive
If we see this, then we can immediately understand that the three cattle, which were cut and killed, are types of the crucified Christ
If we read Genesis 15 along with the book of Leviticus, we can see that the female heifer was for a peace offering
Following this there was the need of the burnt offering, the offering which signifies that everything must be for God
After the peace offering, there was the sin offering, and after the sin offering, there was the burnt offering
Regardless of how strong you may be, if you were to be killed, you would be killed in death, not in resurrection
He was killed as a man who walked on this earth, but now He is living as the heavenly One soaring in the heavens
While His humanity was good for Him to be all the sacrifices, His divinity is good for Him to be the living One
In typology, the turtledove signifies a suffering life and the young pigeon signifies a believing life, a life of faith
His living forever is His testimony, for the testimony of Jesus is always related to the matter of being living
Today Satan and his angels are doing their best to rob Christians of the enjoyment of Christ for the church life
As Abraham drove the fowl away, so we must drive Satan and his angels away from what Christ is to us for the church life
At such a time God will always come in as a furnace to refine us, to burn us out, and also as a torch to enlighten us
On the one hand God is burning us and we are suffering; on the other hand He is enlightening us and we are under the light
It was in this kind of a situation that God passed between the pieces of the sacrifices, and that was the enacting of God's covenant
God made a covenant with Abraham in the way of passing through all of the sacrifices as a smoking furnace and a torch of fire
It was in this way that God confirmed His promise to Abraham by making a covenant with him for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
God's asking Abraham to offer the cattle and birds to Him implied that Abraham had to be one with all of the things that he offered to God
Only by Christ's being crucified as our peace offering, sin offering, and burnt offering and being resurrected to be our life
Abraham's sleep signified that the four hundred years were to the children of Israel a dark night through which they passed
Ishmael's mocking of Isaac was the start of the affliction of Abraham's seed that was to continue for four hundred years
Before the children of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years, they had been tested for ten times forty years already
The persecution of the seed began thirty years after Abraham was called in Genesis 12 and continued for four hundred years
While we are enjoying Christ as the seed within and as the land without, a dark night may fall upon us and some trials and testings may come
By suffering the affliction as God prophesied, God's people should be assured that God would fulfill His covenant
In typology, this means that after all of the experiences of affliction, the church life will be expanded and become spacious
It is here in Genesis 15 that we are in the covenant made through Christ that enables us to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Although some Christians criticize the allegorization of the Bible, Paul took the lead to allegorize the Old Testament
If we are going to appreciate the treasures in the book of Genesis, we must realize that Genesis is a book of allegories
If you read the Bible with this heavenly light, you will see that the whole Bible covers this divine intention
Eventually, God had a new start with a new race, the race of the called ones, the first one of which was Abraham
If you read Abrahams biography you will see that again and again God came to him with a promise concerning two things the seed and the land
Abraham was not young when he was first called by God; he was seventy-five years of age when he answered God's calling in a full way
If when God calls you you have nothing, that is very good, for if you have too much, that will frustrate God's calling
When Abraham was called by God, he did not have a child and he lived in a condemned, demonic land, a land out of which God called him
Following that, it might have been that after Abraham fell into Egypt, drifting downstream like a piece of driftwood, he acquired Hagar
In order to strengthen Abraham's faith, God made a covenant with him in a very extraordinary way, using three cattle and two living birds
Don't you believe that God was sovereign in giving us Hagar in Egypt and in the fact that she gave birth to a boy, not to a girl?
God has been sovereign in three respects in giving us Hagar, in causing her to conceive, and in giving us a boy through her
God told him that a seed would be born not only out of him but also out of his wife, saying that He would give Abraham a son by her
God answered Abraham, saying, 'Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac'
We should not be content with just knowing the stories in Genesis but should press on to understand the meaning of the allegory
In other words, before the law was given, God took a photograph of what would happen with the law four hundred thirty years later
While grace is the proper wife, the mother of the proper heirs , the law is the concubine, the mother of those who are rejected as heirs
God had no intention of bringing in the law and of having man endeavor to keep it for the fulfillment of His purpose
, and the law was given in Exodus 20, four hundred thirty years later, after the exodus out of Egypt about 1491 B
They appreciate the law and try their best to keep it, making themselves Ishmaels, the children of the bondwoman
God does want us to live such a life, but He will work Christ into us to live for us a heavenly life to please Him and glorify Him
When God does not allow us to rely upon Lot then we turn to Eliezer expecting that he will enable us to live a heavenly life for Gods glory
Once we realize that God wants this, then we begin to exercise our own energy, our natural strength, to fulfill God's purpose
Perhaps you say that never again will you lose your temper with your husband or have a negative attitude towards him
The second commandment is that, as a Christian lady and a Christian wife, you need to be nice, sweet, and humble
Your third commandment is never to criticize others, and the fourth is to always love people and never to hate them
Whether we succeed or not in keeping our laws makes no difference in the eyes of God because in His eyes even our successes do not count
Although we may gain an Ishmael who is good in our eyes, we have the deep sensation that we are missing something
Just as the descendants of Ishmael are a problem to Israel today, so the Ishmael that we have produced remains a problem to us
In our ministry we are saying that you have to stop living a Christian life by yourselves and doing a Christian work with worldly means
Do not be bothered at our saying this, for regardless how much we tell people to stop, hardly anyone will stop
If anyone will stop trying to live a Christian life by himself or to work for the Lord by worldly means, blessed is he
When Abraham was eighty-six years of age, he still had too much of his own strength, causing God to wait for another thirteen years
While Abraham was so busy on earth, God might have looked at him and said, 'Poor Abraham, you don't need to be that busy
Our experience today tells us the same thing, for our Ishmael breaks our fellowship with God and keeps us from God's appearing
We see by this that it is not a matter of what we do or of what we are; it is altogether a matter of whether or not we have God's presence
The seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose is nothing less than Christ Himself wrought by God into, through, and out of us
No longer should we consider this story in Genesis merely as a kind of prediction but as an allegory of today's situation
We have a safeguard to check whether or not we have God's presence in our daily life and in our Christian work
Do you have the assurance, the confidence, that day after day Christ is being wrought into your being to be the inner life by whom you live?
In this message we come to Genesis 17, a record of God's crucial dealing with Abraham in confirming His covenant
After God called Abraham, He gave him the promise and then He confirmed the promise by making a covenant with him
We see three things: Sarah's proposal, Hagar's expediency, and Abraham's exercise of the flesh to produce Ishmael
When Abraham brought forth Ishmael he was eightysix years of age and thirteen years later when he was ninetynine God appeared to him again
After Abraham had answered God's calling and had begun to live a life by faith in God for his existence, he had a failure
Taking Hagar to produce Ishmael was not simply a matter of right or wrong or of committing a sin; it was a matter of life
God's intention with Abraham was that He would work Himself into Abraham so that Abraham might bring forth a child to fulfill God's purpose
His wife Sarah even proposed this thinking that it would help Abraham to produce the seed since Abraham was old and she was out of function
It was as if God had turned His face away from Abraham and had refused to speak to him for that length of time
In the heavenly record those years were lost because Abraham exercised his natural self to do something for the fulfilling of God's purpose
We see that God charged Abraham with two things that Abraham had to walk before the all-sufficient God and that he had to be perfect
El means the Strong One, the Mighty One, and Shaddai, implying the meaning of breast, udder, means all-sufficient
If we did not have the New Testament we could never understand adequately this title of God but now we can understand this title adequately
Regardless of how perfect we may be in ourselves, we are still short of God and need to be perfected by and with God
Have you ever realized that regardless of how good you are or how perfect you are in human eyes, without God you are short of something?
The losing of our temper should force us to learn one lesson never to stay away from God but to trust in Him every moment
Regardless of how much we might train our four fingers to do things, they will still be imperfect because they are without the thumb
In order to be the number five, bearing the responsibility to fulfill God's eternal purpose, God must be added to us
As the person is the reality of one's name, so the changing of Abraham's name signifies the changing of his person
The more they seek this kind of spirituality, the more they become barren and individualistic, producing no seed
Even this kind of self has to be terminated so that we may be a multiplied person, not an exalted one, for the fulfilling of God's purpose
And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be'
Sarai's name was changed to Sarah because in a broad way, not in a narrow way, she was to be a mother of many nations
Although you may be a brother or sister, if you do not have God added into you, you are a narrow brother or sister
If you are going to be a broadened person with a broadened view and with a broadened mind, heart, and spirit, you need God to enlarge you
There was no need for God to confirm it again, for He had confirmed it once already, but it had to be confirmed from Abraham's side
While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not because he had used his natural strength to produce Ishmael
In a strict sense, circumcision has nothing to do with the dealing with sin; it is a matter of being crucified and buried with Christ
As long as our natural strength remains, it is difficult for God to come in to be our everything for the fulfillment of His purpose
Suppose I, a saved person who has been justified by God, still live, act, and work by myself, doing everything by myself
The confirmation of the covenant by circumcision concerned the seed and the land for the fulfillment of God's purpose
In order to fulfill God's eternal purpose that man express and represent Him, we need to have Christ as our seed and as our land
In order to have Christ as the seed and the land for the fulfillment of Gods purpose we need to be circumcised and to live a crucified life
When the flesh, the self, and the old man have been terminated, the door is open for God to come in and bring forth Isaac
When we reject and deny our self and live a crucified life, we immediately have a new beginning in resurrection
If we do not live a crucified life, we are cut off from Christ, from the church life, and from the supply of the divine udder
In these verses we see that God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah
The promise of the birth of the seed was confirmed definitely at the time when Abraham was as old as dead and Sarah was out of function
The birth of Isaac was not the result of Abraham and Sarah's energy but that it was absolutely the result of God's gracious visitation
Isaac was not produced by any element in Abrahams natural being he was brought forth by Gods allsufficient supply out of the divine udder
God will only honor what is out of Him because only the seed that is produced out of Him by the supply of His grace can fulfill His purpose
Beginning with Genesis 15, God began to train him in the matter of knowing grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Throughout all the ages, God's purpose has remained the same: to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth
If God can gain a people, He will be able to accomplish His purpose, but if He cannot gain a people, He will be defeated
Although God called only one person, Abraham, this person had to become a race so that God could be expressed and represented on earth
It is impossible for an individual to fulfill God's purpose, for what God needs is not just an individual but a people
Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as Genesis 16 reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed
Since God's divine title denotes His divine Person, the unveiling of the divine title is actually the revelation of the divine Person
In 1:1 God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God's creation
The divine title in 17:1 denotes that God is the rich source of supply as grace to His people for them to fulfill His purpose
All of the elements and ingredients of the riches of the milk we drink become our constituent, our organic tissue
After that message a very highly educated brother said to me Brother Lee that message was very good but the term eating Jesus is too wild
In John 6:35 and 57 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life' and 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
In Revelation 22 we see that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
If we put all of these verses together we can see that our God today is One out of whom something is flowing to quench supply and satisfy us
We all must drink of the rich supply that flows out from our God that we may be able to fulfill the divine purpose
The Bible reveals that God's intention is to get into us and that we must eat and drink of Him, taking something of Himself into our being
What Abraham did for the fulfilling of God's purpose was accomplished by his natural being and natural strength
Since he did something for God by his natural strength, God was displeased and disappeared from him for thirteen years
You must drink of the supply of this udder and not do anything for Me by your natural strength or natural ability
Apart from Me, it is impossible for you to fulfill My purpose because apart from Me you can do nothing for My economy
Not only must God's title be unveiled to us, but our names need to be changed, meaning that we need to be changed
Everyone likes to be exalted; however, God does not want to exalt us but to multiply us, making us a father of a great multitude
While our natural tendency is to be exalted, God wants to change our name from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication
For the sake of the fulfillment of His purpose, we need to forget our old name and be changed from being exalted to being multiplied
It is not merely for the increase or for the expansion of our work; it is for God to be expressed and represented on the earth
It is not easy for a family to live together with several young people because we all like to have our privacy and stay by ourselves
If the husbands are honest, sometimes even living with their wives is too much for them, and they would prefer to be left alone
If we are going to be hospitable, our name must be changed from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication
Your particular character has to be changed into a general one so that you can be a mother of nations and take care of many people
When our name is Sarai we say, 'My husband, my home, my day, my children, my position, my function in the meetings, my everything'
Although the sisters may say 'my princess,' God wants them simply to become 'princess' without any 'my,' to be general, not particular
If the brothers still insist on being exalted and if the sisters still prefer to be particular, how could we have the church life?
For the fulfilling of God's purpose, Jacob's name was changed to Israel ; a heel-holder, a supplanter , was changed into a prince of God
If Jacob had remained a supplanter, he could never have been used by God in the fulfillment of the divine purpose
The proper church life is that which carries out God's eternal purpose through being supplied with the riches of God Himself
We must drop ourselves, depreciate our natural strength and ability, and walk before God, drinking of the riches of His udder
If we do this, spontaneously some element of His divine being will be wrought into us to produce the seed for the fulfillment of His purpose
Among and within us God has His dominion, and in this dominion God has a kingdom in which He may build up His habitation
It is Bethel, the gate of heaven, with the heavenly ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth
We need to forget ourselves, cease from our natural source of supply, walk before God, and drink of His udder all day long
The riches of the unveiled divine Being will be wrought into our human being as the allsufficient grace for us to fulfill the divine purpose
The Apostle Paul labored more abundantly than all the apostles; yet it was not he but the grace of God that was with him
He did not exercise his natural strength to produce Ishmaels but enjoyed the rich supply of the sufficient grace to bring forth many Isaacs
In this message we come to a great and basic truth in the holy Word that is sown as a seed in Genesis 17 circumcision
In order to understand circumcision, we need to see two main points of the divine revelation unfolded in the Bible
The accomplishment of God's purpose does not depend upon what we can do but upon God's working Himself into us
As we have seen, Abraham did not give a clear-cut answer to God's call but dragged his feet through mud and water
It was not easy for Abraham to remain in the place where God wanted him to be and not long afterward he drifted down to Egypt
At the time of Genesis 17, Abraham had been robbed of all the places where he had been and of all the important persons he had acquired
Sisters, it is absolutely right for you to be for the Lord, but it is absolutely wrong that anything of yourselves be for Him
The seed of circumcision was not sown in Genesis 12 or 15 but in Genesis 17, after Abraham had been robbed of so much
God appeared to Abraham again, unveiled Himself as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder, and told Abraham to change his name
How can He take possession of the land so that He may have the proper church life for His dwelling place, dominion, satisfaction, and rest?
Our intelligence, wisdom, natural ability, natural strength, and all that we are in our natural being must be taken away by the Lord
God has a purpose and He has the called ones, but there is a frustration to His coming in to bring forth the seed our flesh
Throughout the years, we have been robbed of so many things, but our flesh, our natural strength, our natural ability may still remain
In the Bible, the flesh includes much more than this, for it also includes our natural strength, ability, power, and talents
Although the book of Genesis contains nearly all the seeds of the biblical truths, it does not contain the seed of the overcoming of sin
Circumcision must be in resurrection, and it will always usher us into resurrection, just as death ushers people into resurrection
Both baptism and circumcision have the same purpose to terminate our natural being and bring us into resurrection
Romans 2:28-29 says that circumcision is not 'outward in the flesh,' but 'of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter'
Since the priest had sprinkled water on his head and had changed his name to John, he thought that he could do the same to the meat
Baptism must be an inward reality in the spirit, not an outward form of sprinkling a few drops of water on a person's head
The circumcision of Christ, like baptism, means to terminate our old being and to make us a new creation, a new person
God called that appointed time the time of life, saying that according to the time of life He would return and Sarah would have a son
Praise the Lord that we do have Christ and the grace of God worked into us so that we can have the seed and possess the land
Following that, in chapters fifteen through seventeen, the third section, God trained him to know grace for the fulfillment of His purpose
As Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose, God changed him in both name and in nature
Abraham had been called had learned to live by faith in God for his existence and had come to know grace for the fulfillment of Gods purpose
At first, Abraham did not realize that one of these men was the Lord, Jehovah, and that the other two were angels
Of these forms of God's appearing as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as El-Shaddai, and as a mortal man which do you prefer?
Before the feet of the Lord Jesus were washed with the womans tears in the house of Simon Gods feet were washed in front of Abrahams tent
While Jesus was in the house of Simon having His feet washed and anointed, the priests of Judaism were worshipping God in the temple
Is He only the God of glory, the Most High God, and the El-Shaddai, or One in the form of a mortal man, the same as you are?
He does not come in the form of God but in the form of man, without making any declaration that He is Jehovah God
At this juncture, the Lord clearly unveiled to Abraham that He was Jehovah God by saying, 'Is anything too marvelous for the Lord '?
Although we may be unprepared to worship God, we may see someone approaching and ask him to stay with us for a while
Are you experiencing God as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as the El-Shaddai, or as the One in the form of a mortal man?
How sweet it is when God comes to us not with His divine glory or in His high position but in the form of a mortal man!
In his circumcised state, God came to visit him, and as a circumcised person Abraham had an intimate communion with the visiting God
Religion always charges people to go to God, but Genesis 18 reveals that God came to visit His circumcised one
When Abraham was sitting in the tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God appeared to him with the two angels
Because in both Genesis 18 and Matthew 13 three measures of fine flour signify the resurrected Christ in His humanity
The cakes, the calf, and the butter and milk all signify the riches of the all-inclusive Christ for the satisfaction of both God and man
Although the Bible does not say that Abraham presented this meal to God as an offering, in actuality he did so
In other words, we offer Christ to God as three measures of fine flour, as a tender and good calf, and as butter and milk
While we were enjoying intimate fellowship with God, we not only received Christ from God but also offered Christ to God as God's food
We all need to be in such an intimate fellowship with God that we not only enjoy Christ but also offer Christ to God for His enjoyment
The highest fellowship is not when we enjoy Christ so much before God but when God enjoys Him in us more than we do
The highest and richest meeting in the church is the meeting in which we offer Christ to God for His satisfaction
Today God is not only accomplishing His plan to fulfill His purpose, but as the Lord over all men He is also judging sin
The principle is the same in every aspect of our lives: in our married life, home life, personal life, Christian life, and church life
He intends to produce Christ and to destroy the 'Sodom' in our home life, work life, and even in our Christian and church life
Whenever we become nothing, that is a good time, a divinely appointed time, for us to participate in more life
We can do what other people cannot do and we can be what others cannot be because Christ is marvelous and wonderful in our experience of Him
After enjoying such intimate fellowship with Abraham, God and the two angels were satisfied, strengthened, and refreshed
Verse 16 says that then 'the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way'
Verse 22 says, 'And the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom: but Abraham remained still standing before the Lord'
Although Abraham did not expect such a visitation, God appeared to him in the form of a mortal man, conversing with him as with a friend
God had found a man to whom He could commit what was on His heart, a man to respond to His heart's intention and echo His heart's desire
In this message we come to another seed of the divine revelation sown in the book of Genesis the seed of intercession
Although we may suppose that Melchisedec was interceding behind the scene for Abraham, there is no record of this
The first clear mention of intercession in the Bible is in Genesis 18, where we see that Abraham was the first intercessor
In Genesis 18 we not only have a story of intercession but a clear revelation of the basic principles of intercession
Abraham did not wake up one morning concerned for Lot and then kneel down to pray to the One on the throne in heaven regarding him
While Abraham was sitting at his tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God came to him in the form of a mortal man
He surely did not come for a meal; neither did He come to confirm His promise regarding Sarah's giving birth to a son
God knew that there was no one on earth who was as concerned for Lot and who was so much with God as Abraham was
Rather, He came down to visit Abraham in the form of a mortal man so that Abraham might easily talk with Him and intercede for Lot
In Genesis 18 Abraham did not pray to God or call on the name of God; he talked to God as with an intimate friend
If he says, 'I would like to stay with you for a while longer,' then you will know that you can open yourself to him
Although God spoke to Abraham during the preparation and eating of the meal, He did not disclose the purpose for which He came
As Abraham lingered in God's presence, even after the two angels had left for Sodom, remaining standing before Him , God opened up to him
We must come all the way from Ur of Chaldea through many places to the tent door at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron
Even after he had slaughtered Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Abraham was not ready to converse with God in an intimate way
In chapters fifteen and sixteen we see that although Abraham was a man who sought God and loved Him, he was still so much in his flesh
In chapter seventeen he was circumcised and terminated, his name was changed from Abram to Abraham, and he became another person
When Abraham was in this condition, he was prepared and qualified to receive a revelation from God's heart concerning His desire
Although millions of people belong to the name of God, very few have been prepared, disciplined, trained, circumcised, and terminated
Suppose God would come to you in this way today and you would serve Him a meal and talk with Him, speaking with Him face to face
Abraham seemed to be saying Lord dont You know that in Sodom the wicked city which You are about to destroy there is a righteous person
None of the outsiders knew what they were talking about, but they understood each other because they were intimate friends
Since all proper intercession is according to the revelation which is out of God's heart, it must also be according to God's heart
Abraham did not intercede according to the outward word of God but according to the inward intention of God's heart
We have seen that Abraham did not abruptly say good-bye to the Lord but walked with Him for a certain distance
Have you ever experienced this kind of intercession, talking with God in a challenging way, saying, 'Lord, is this Your way of doing things?
In verses 27 through 32 we see that Abraham continued to talk to God about the number of righteous people it would take to spare the city
When Abraham proposed that thirty be the number, the Lord said that He would spare Sodom if thirty were found there
When God told Abraham that He would not destroy the city for the sake of ten righteous persons , Abraham was disappointed
According to Abraham's figuration, there must have been at least ten people in Lot's family, if all his sons-in-law were included
Proper intercession is neither according to God's love nor according to His grace, but according to His righteousness
We must challenge God according to His righteousness because His righteousness binds Him more than His love and His grace do
Every good intercessor knows that the way to bind God effectively is to challenge Him according to His righteousness
We may say to God Lord dont You know that You have promised us definitely in the New Testament to finish the good work that You have begun
From now on, many of us will exercise our spirit to intercede for the church by challenging God according to His heart's desire
We know that His heart's desire is to save His people out of the wicked city, to rescue today's Lot from the condition of condemnation
In this message we must consider this record in detail, taking it as a warning for ourselves and for our children and relatives
In verse 8 Peter referred to him as a 'righteous man' whose 'righteous soul' was vexed with the unlawful deeds of the people in Sodom
His grandfather brought him from Ur of Chaldea to Haran, stopping halfway because the grandfather would not go on
God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city
God does not respect persons, but He does respect behavior, respecting whether or not we are active or passive in seeking Him
Those who took no initiative but who were passively brought into the way of the church have gradually fallen away
When Lot was faced with the choice between spiritual influence and material substance, he chose material substance
Abraham did nothing wrong in dealing with Lot, but simply because he dealt with him, Lot would never return to him
In 19:27 and 28, Abraham rose up early in the morning and looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah because he was so concerned for Lot
In spite of the fact that Lot knew Sodom was wicked in the eyes of God, he eventually entered into that evil place and lived there
Ur of Chaldea was a place of idols, Egypt was a place of worldly riches and pleasures, and Sodom was a city of sin
Although Lot stayed away from the land of idols and the place of worldly pleasures he drifted like a piece of driftwood into the city of sin
Although Lot was rescued from captivity by the Lord's overcomer, he was not helped to come back to the way of God
Lot went back to live in the wicked city which was condemned by God and which was to be destroyed by the judgment of God
According to ancient custom, whoever sat at the gate of the city was one of the elders, for only they had the privilege of sitting there
While the angels were staying in Lot's house, the Sodomites came to indulge in their sodomitical lust, coming from every corner of the city
If someone having a fresh sense of smell would come into the midst of the garlic eaters, he would immediately notice the scent of garlic
When Lot preached the gospel to them, some would not believe the word from the Lord, thinking that he was joking
If they had not brought the wine with them, how else could they have had it in the cave where they were dwelling?
If they would come in to the church life and remain in its pure atmosphere for a few months, they would never return to the sinful world
That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame
Because some of her children, especially her daughters, were still in Sodom and because her house and her clothing also were there
Lot's life issued in bringing forth Moabites and Ammonites , who were rejected by God even to their tenth generation
Genesis 19 might be the only record in human history regarding a pillar of salt, and we need to consider it very carefully
The Lord was saying, 'If you are on your housetop at the time of My coming, do not come down into your house to take away your stuff
When the angels had brought the four of them outside the city, they said, 'Escape for thy soul; look not behind thee'
The seed of being put to shame was sown in Genesis 19, grows in Luke 17 and 1 John 2, and is reaped in Revelation 16
The basic concept of this message is that a genuine saved person faces the definite possibility of being put to shame
In this message we need to hear a sobering word from the Lord, a word that will sober our mind and quicken our spirit
Concerning the things of God, the best thing for a wife to do is to go along with and walk together with her husband
That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt signifies that she had lost her function and had become a sign of shame
Although the name of Abraham's wife, Sarah, is mentioned many times, there is no mention of the name of Lot's wife
At her looking back to that place, the Lord caused her to become a pillar of salt as a warning example to us all
We must heed the warning that a truly saved person faces the possibility of being put to shame at the Lord's appearing
What a shame for a believer to become a lifeless pillar of salt standing in the open air for nothing but suffering!
In this portion of the word out of the mouth of the Lord, we see that we must follow Him in the way of absoluteness
Many messages have been given and booklets published on John 3:16, but where are the messages and booklets on Luke 14:26-35?
In the kingdom age there will be the earth the land for the fulfillment of Gods purpose and there will also be the lake of fire the dunghill
Although they are believers, yet they live like worldly people, shopping and dressing in the same way as the worldly people do
Since they live and walk the same as the worldlings, there is no difference between them and the worldly people
In Luke 1734 and 35 the Lord said I tell you in that night there will be two on one couch the one will be taken and the other will be left
If you read the context of Luke 17:22-37, you will see that this word is not given to unbelievers but to the Lord's disciples
The 'two' in verses 34 and 35 refer to two of the Lord's disciples, one of whom will be taken and the other of whom will be left
The children of God who do not abide in the Lord as the anointing teaches will be put to shame at the Lord's coming back
We should simply say, 'Amen, Lord, I'm just abiding in You according to Your teaching of the inward anointing'
Notice that, according to the Greek, it does not say, like the King James Version, 'before Him' but 'from Him'
At the Lord's appearing we shall be in His parousia and not be cast out to the third place, the place of shame
Genesis 19:30-38, probably the first recorded case of incest in human history, is part of the section on living in fellowship with God
Abraham had a family for God's purpose, for Abraham alone could do nothing for the fulfillment of God's purpose
As we shall see, at a certain point, Lot's family group lost its function in life because the wife became a pillar of salt
She should have been salty and maintained a good flavor, but due to her worldliness she lost the function in life
Praise the Lord that eventually the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God is seen in one of the descendants who came out of this incest
Ruth, a Moabitess, a descendant of Lot through his daughter, became the great grandmother of David and an ancestress of Christ
Abraham's tent was the seed, and the tabernacle erected in the wilderness by the children of Israel was the growth
The children of Israel were the development of the seed of God's people, and now the church today is the continuation of this development
Lot's family was a part of the people of God, but they had left God's witness and testimony, which were Abraham and what he was testifying
God's witness and testimony were at the tent of Abraham by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, not with Lot in the city of Sodom
God's presence was with Abraham's family because his family was the typical people of God and had the proper standing of God's testimony
All God's people, being His family, should dwell by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, where God can pay them a friendly and intimate visit
After the angels left for Sodom to rescue Lot and his family, God's presence was with Abraham, His dear friend
Why do you make so much of the difference between Abraham's family and Lot's family when both of them are God's people?
Besides the family which was on the ground where they could have intimate fellowship with God, there was a free group
The source, the root, of the problem of the ancient free group was its departing from God's witness and testimony
As many of us can testify, when we departed from the denominations, we were happy and felt as though we were in the heavens
Although we may not be able to discern the difference between them by our thought, we can discern it by the sense of life deep in our spirit
They firstly left Gods testimony and drifted into a Godcondemned situation and then still having their own choice went to a little place
If you examine today's situation, you will find that the leader of nearly every free group has been drugged and befuddled with some wine
Most of the leaders of the free groups, being drunk with some wine, say, do, and decide things in a befuddled way
They may be very active in the things which they are pursuing, but they are asleep as far as God's testimony is concerned
We have seen that the mother, who, as the wife, should have been the helper in life, became a pillar of salt because of her worldliness
When Lot's family came into the cave, there was no function of life, for there was no function of the proper wife
They have lost the function of the Body of Christ, the proper function of life, and use worldly methods to fill the gap
Although they had neither the proper leadership nor the function of life, they had an evil way of acquiring the seed
Look at today's situation: some groups use rock music, dancing, drama, movies, and games to satisfy their desire of securing the increase
Once people have lost the proper wife with the function in life, they use ugly and worldly means for securing the increase
Lot's daughters had lost their sense of morality, having been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world
The result was that his daughters had no sense of morality and that their humanity was degraded to the lowest level
Some free groups today have also been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world and only care for success, not for the means
For the Lord to say, 'I never knew you' means 'I never approved of you because you are a worker of lawlessness'
In Genesis 16 through 21, there are three kinds of births: the birth of Ishmael, the birth of Moab and Ben-ammi, and the birth of Isaac
Although the Moabites were rejected to the tenth generation, in the case of Ruth we see the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God
Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, brought his family from Judah to seek the peace and prosperity of the Moabites
Even a descendant of Moab, a man born through incest, could participate, through redemption, in the incarnation of Christ
After Genesis 18 and 19, in which we see Abraham's high attainment in his experience of God, there is a record of his weakness in Genesis 20
If it were of human manufacture, the writer would not have included this record of Abraham's weakness and shortcomings
While in chapter eighteen he made a glorious intercession, in chapter twenty we find the record of a shameful one
Abraham's journeying toward the south meant that he had left the standing of fellowship at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron
If you go to Las Vegas and meet someone there who asks about what you do at home, you will find it difficult to give him an honest answer
When Abraham left the standing of intimate fellowship with God and journeyed southward, he lost God's presence
In chapter twenty, he should have been a circumcised person, not a natural person, for he had truly been dealt with by God
Many are the blessings that you have received from God, if you do not remain in fellowship with Him, you will be in the flesh
If we consider our past experience, we shall find that at least a few times we have done the same kind of thing
After Abraham had left God's presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure lying by sacrificing his wife
Although you may not believe that you have a reserve, when you take a vacation from the church life, it will be exposed
In other words, in the presence of God, a man always stands for faith and the wife always stands for God's grace
We do not know how many times we have been in danger of damaging grace and losing the testimony because we have left the proper standing
At a certain juncture, God came in to deal with the circumstances so that the testimony of His grace might be preserved
If this had been clear to Abraham, he would not have lied; he would have believed that God would care for His grace and His testimony
When Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, oxen, servants, and silver, Abraham did not dare to say, 'I don't need your help
God wisely and sovereignly restored Sarah, taking care of His grace and His testimony, and at the same time He disciplined Abraham
Abimelech needed Abraham's intercession because the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech
Many times, after we have failed the Lord, we are unable to pray for days, even though no one knows about our failure
When Abraham forgot his need and interceded for Abimelech and his house, not only were their needs met but also his
If you forget your need and pray for the needs of others, God will not only answer your prayer for them but also your prayer for yourself
The Bible does not give us a full record of Abraham's intercession for Abimelech like it does of his intercession for Lot
If you hold on to your feelings, your mouth will be shut, Satan will be victorious over you, and you will be deadened for days
Do not think that if you have attainments as high as those recorded in Genesis 18 and 19, you will have no problems
Although your old self has been dealt with by God, it is still untrustworthy, even if it has been fully circumcised
Along with His answer to your shameful intercession, He will also answer your previously unanswered prayers for your own needs
In the foregoing messages we have covered nearly ten chapters in Genesis regarding Abraham's experience with God
In those chapters we saw that Abraham, God's called one, had come to many stations and had passed through many stages
When, at the time of chapter twenty, the seed still had not come, even such a giant of faith as Abraham could not stand the test
Being the giant of faith, he interceded, not with boldness or the release of the spirit, but in a shameful way
If the first section of Genesis 21 has a spiritual significance, then the second section must also have a spiritual significance
Isaac, whose name means 'laughter' or 'he will laugh' , was born according to God's promise at the appointed time, the time of life
In God's calling us there is a goal, the same goal as there was with His calling Abraham to bring forth the seed
Although we can produce many things and have done so ever since we were saved, it is very difficult for us to bring forth Christ
According to His timing, He will come in as the strength of grace to bring forth through us what He desires to have
Verse 8 says that 'the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned'
Isaac grew up and was weaned away from his mother's nourishment, meaning that he was no longer a young child but had become a young boy
God even counted Ishmael's persecution of Isaac as the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people
It was she who proposed to Abraham that he have a son by Hagar and now she tells him to cast Hagar and Ishmael out
In this way, we brothers learn the lesson of hating our natural life and all the good things we can produce out of ourselves
It was only after Abraham had undergone dealing after dealing and failure after failure that Isaac finally came forth
Christ has been born in our Christian life, but we still keep our Ishmael, hesitating to give up our good behavior
Many of us still boast in our natural goodness, saying, 'I am not as proud as some of the brothers and sisters are
When the Christ who has been born in our Christian life has begun to grow up, our natural goodness will mock Him
You may do it apparently, but secretly you still hold on to Hagar and Ishmael, to the law and to your natural attributes and goodness
The brothers and sisters will then begin to rise up and say, 'From now on there will be no more Hagar and Ishmael
When we are in our soul, in our natural being, we are wandering in the wilderness and can easily drift into the world
We see from all this that there is a well, a source of living, which can make us a wild hunter who kills life and can join us to the world
In 1 Corinthians 12:13, the Apostle Paul says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit, that is, of one well of water
Are you drinking of the well for Isaac, the well which signifies the divine well, the well of Christ, the well of the Spirit?
In Genesis 20 and 21 we see that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, did not reject God but accepted Him in his own clever way
Today, while the whole human race is living by a source which is without redemption, we are living by a redeemed source
The living water which we are drinking today is not natural; it has been redeemed at the cost of Christ's complete redemption
A tamarisk a type of willow tree has very fine leaves often grows near water and gives the impression of the flowing of the riches of life
The Lord Jesus said that whoever believes in Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
One is the natural source in the wilderness of our soul, whereas the other is the redeemed source in the garden of our spirit
Today we also need to fight for the divine well that we may have it for both the Christian life and the proper church life
The God whom Abraham experienced in chapter twenty-one is the same as the One revealed in John 1:1, 4: 'In the beginning was the Word
God was not revealed to Abraham but was experienced by him as the ever-living, secret, mysterious One who is the eternal life
In chapter twelve he only called upon the name of Jehovah, not yet experiencing Him as the God who is the mysterious, ever-living One
The One we have within us today is the very El Olam, the hidden, secret, concealed, mysterious, ever-living One
Here the Scripture only tells us of one thing that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba and called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam
As we have pointed out, Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely a record of God's creation but a record of life, with the tree of life as its center
As the tree of life is the center of the record in chapters one and two, the tamarisk tree is the center of the record here
Our Christian life and the proper church life are both a tamarisk tree, expressing the tree of life by which we live
We also need to go up from Beer-sheba to Jerusalem, not only having the church life at Beer-sheba but also in Jerusalem
Ishmael lived in the wilderness and was joined to Egypt, but Isaac lived in a planted place and was led to Moriah
As a result of this all the children of Israel were brought three times every year to the very mountain in Moriah to which Isaac was brought
Isaac's being brought to Mount Moriah was a seed which was developed in the going up to Mount Zion of all the children of Israel
These two chapters, giving the record of the birth and offering of Isaac, cover a period of at least twenty years
Although some have paid a little attention to the tree of life, they have not paid attention to the tamarisk tree
According to our opinion, the planting of a tamarisk tree may be insignificant, perhaps being only an ancient type of landscaping
If we do not have this tamarisk tree experience, we can only call on the old title of God, Jehovah, not on His newly unveiled title, El Olam
In chapter twentyone Abraham called on a new title of God El Olam the mysterious hidden secret yet so real living and everexisting God
The people in ancient times ate vitamins, but they had no scientific knowledge of them nor scientific terms to describe them
After the mention of Abraham's planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him
Now, after Eliezer, Lot, and Ishmael had all been rejected, Abraham had acquired Isaac, the seed promised by God, and was at peace
Many Christians, including some Christian workers, have never learned the lesson of offering back to God what He has given them
One day, after our having a good enjoyment of the Lord, He will ask us to give back to Him the gift, work, or success He has given us
Genesis 21:34, the last verse of chapter twenty-one, says, 'Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days'
During that time Isaac grew up by the well of Beersheba growing up by a life of planting and calling on the name of the Lord the Eternal God
The one whom Abraham was told to offer up was a grown-up son, one who had lived with him in a life of planting and calling
When God told Abraham to offer Isaac, He told him to go to the land of Moriah and to offer him upon one of the mountains there
The mountain on which Isaac was offered was later called Mount Moriah, eventually becoming Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built
Isaac, who was carrying the wood for the burnt offering, said, 'Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering'?
Although it is a long journey from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah and it is a journey which causes some suffering, it results in blessing
The more we stay in the church life, the more it will bring us from Beer-sheba to Moriah, from the growing water to the burning fire
Abraham had to pass through the separation of Lot, the rejection of Eliezer, the casting out of Ishmael, and the birth of Isaac
Although God had promised Abraham a seed, He did not give it to him until Abraham had made a thorough clearance of Lot, Eliezer, and Ishmael
As we have seen, Isaac did not grow up in the wilderness but in Beer-sheba, properly growing by the life of calling on the Lord
If you offer it back to God, after it has passed through death, it will be returned to you in resurrection and become a blessing
It all depends on our growing up to be offered to God as a burnt offering and then being raised up from the dead to be a resurrected gift
If you offer your one grain to God and allow Him to put it into death, it will be returned to you in resurrection
We see that Abraham believed in God for two things: for giving life to the dead and for calling things not being as being
The birth of Isaac was related to Gods calling things not being as being and his being returned was related to Gods giving life to the dead
In verse 2 God told Abraham to go into the land of Moriah and offer Isaac on one of the mountains of which He would tell him
On the one hand, in the church life today, as true descendants of Abraham, we are on Mount Zion; on the other hand, we are on our way there
His descendants, the Israelites, were the development of this seed, and we today are the further development of the seed
Verse 4 indicates that Abraham traveled for three days, for we are told that on the third day he saw the appointed place afar off
If you look at a map, you will see that the distance between Beer-sheba and Moriah is approximately fifty-five miles
On the third day Abraham put Isaac on the altar, and then what he offered to God was given back to him in resurrection
Because we are in His provision and have the vision, everything is clear, nothing is opaque, and there is no separation between us and Him
In the church life everything is crystal clear and transparent in God's eyes and in ours, and nothing is opaque
It was this infused faith that brought him to Mount Moriah where he enjoyed God's provision and had a thoroughly transparent vision from God
At that time there was no one on earth nor in the whole universe who was as clear about divine things as Abraham was
We are not going downward to Egypt we are traveling upward to Mount Moriah where we shall enjoy Gods provision and have a transparent vision
On the third day, Abraham put the two servants aside, saying, 'I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you'
It was no longer a story of four people the father, the son, and the two servants; it was now a story of Abraham and his son Isaac
Before Christ bore the cross and walked to Calvary, Golgotha, Isaac bore the wood for the burnt offering and walked along the same way
We see that Abraham was a type of the Father, and Isaac, with the wood upon him, was a type of the Only Begotten Son of God
As Abraham and Isaac were climbing Mount Moriah, Isaac said, 'Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering'?
Do you not believe that while Jesus was bearing the cross on the way to Calvary He fellowshipped with the Father?
In 22:5 we see that Isaac took his father's will, and in Matthew 26:39 we see that Christ chose the Father's will
He not only followed the father to the foot of the mount; he also obeyed him in taking up the wood and in being bound
Even when the father laid him on the altar, took the knife, and stretched out his hand to slay him, he did not rebel
John 1:14, speaking of the Son of God, says, 'We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father'
Praise Him that He was willing to be a little lamb putting His horns among human beings and being caught by us
When in Revelation 5 the Apostle John saw the scroll which no one in heaven or on earth was worthy to open, he wept
Many of us have had the wrong impression in the past saying that receiving a good job or material benefit means that the Lord has blessed us
We have all been told to count our blessings one by one, counting such things as our degree, promotion, wife, house, and children
We, the Christians, are the stars, the heavenly descendants of Abraham; and the genuine Jews, God's earthly people, are the sand, the dust
Although they are an earthly people, they are not the dust under the sea, but the dust, the sand, by the seashore
According to Revelation 208 and 9 at the end of the millennium Gog and Magog will fight against the camp of the saints and the beloved city
The camp of the saints is the camp of all the heavenly stars, and the beloved city, Jerusalem, is the city of the separated sand
Those represented by the Apostles are the heavenly stars, and those represented by the twelve tribes are the sand of the seashore
After seeing this, we need to say, 'Praise the Lord, God's blessing is not a good house, car, degree, promotion, wife, or child
God's blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
In the four Gospels we have the individual Christ, but at the end of Revelation we have the corporate Christ including all true believers
May we all expect that the blessing which we shall receive of God will be the multiplication that will issue in Christ, the unique seed
In Genesis 22 Christ is revealed in three ways: as the angel of the Lord , as the ram , and as the seed of Abraham
The angel of the Lord, who was Christ, provided the ram, a type of Christ, which eventually issued in the seed, who is also Christ
Genesis 23 is focused on the matter of a burying place and gives us a detailed account of the purchase of a sepulcher
Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba, she died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God
We all must answer that we are living in Beer-sheba, in the church by the well of living water and the tamarisk tree
Before the Lord comes back some of the older ones may leave Beersheba the church life die in Hebron and wait there for the New Jerusalem
According to our natural concept, Abraham, one who was so good with God, should not have suffered all these things
Suddenly, while Abraham was enjoying a happy life with his wife Sarah and his son Isaac, Sarah, the factor of his happiness, was taken away
When Sarah died, the atmosphere, life, and happiness of this family were all taken away, and the family itself was gone
As God's called ones, we Christians should be so weighty that people are surprised and say, 'Why is this young man so weighty?
Genesis does not say a word regarding how Abraham put up his tent, how much he paid for it, or exactly where he erected it
Rather, he had strong faith in the God of resurrection, believing that his dear wife would be in that city and in that better country
Although he might have been somewhat light with his tent, he was not light concerning the burying place of his wife
His intention in purchasing the cave of Machpelah was not only to bury Sarah there, but also to bury himself there
Everyone who was buried in this cave was buried as one of a couple: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah
Deep within, Abraham was filled with the expectation that one day his wife would be in the city of foundations
Although in ancient times it was not a small thing to take Jacob from Egypt to Canaan to be buried, Jacob's sons did it for him
Whenever anyone saw this, he would immediately have had the sense that it was a place of death, a place of termination
He devoted much attention and spent a large amount of money to purchase the burying place for Sarah, himself, and his descendants
If we have the light from the New Testament, we shall realize that this indicates the expectation of resurrection
Our forefather, Abraham, God's called one, did not care very much for the present, but he did pay attention to the future
In Genesis 2 we see that for the fulfillment of God's purpose we must have the divine life signified by the tree of life
When we were on Genesis 1 and 2, we saw that those chapters are not only a record of God's creation but a record of life
If you read those chapters carefully, you will see that many aspects of God's creation are omitted because they are not related to life
In the same principle only those aspects of Abrahams history which are related to life are recorded in chapters twentyone through twentyfour
The fact that such a long period is covered in just fifty chapters proves that Genesis is not a record of history
We should not understand the Bible according to our common knowledge or tradition, but come back to the pure Word
Whenever we read any portion of the Scriptures, we must forget all we have learned in the past and look to the Lord for something new
For the fulfillment of this purpose, God promised to give Abraham the good land and the seed which would inherit the land
If you consider the Bible as a whole, you will see that Isaac's marriage was altogether for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
Isaac's marriage was not common nor merely for his human living; it was for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
When this son was thirty-seven years old, the wife and mother died, and the father buried her in a very meaningful way
The father and the son, both of whom were now unmarried, were left alone, living together in that sad condition for three years
There is no record that God said, 'Abraham, let Me charge you to send someone to your own country to get a wife for Isaac
If we live in oneness with Him, He will not need to tell us what He desires, because we shall already know it by being one with Him
Although Abraham was desperate to take care of his son's marriage, he would not accept a Canaanite as Isaac's wife
If we had been Abraham, we might have taken the easy way and said, 'There are many girls here in the land of Canaan
Abraham did not think this way, but sent his oldest servant far away, back to the country from where he came, to find a wife for Isaac
When we live in oneness with Him, we shall share His concept, and whatever we think and do will be in accordance with His feeling
God will not need to say anything, for we shall sense what He senses, knowing His inner feeling because we live in oneness with Him
Young brothers, if everything you do is in accordance with God's economy, even your marriage will be the carrying out of His economy
If we are such a person, whatever we say will be God's expression, and whatever we do will be for the fulfillment of His purpose
Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord
Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way
Rather, he only charged his servant to serve by the Lord, assuring him that God would send His angel before him and prosper his way
After she had done this, the servant was clear that Rebekah was the one and he gave her a ring and two bracelets
It was hard work for a young woman to draw water out of the well and pour it into the trough for ten camels to drink, but she did it
If the young sisters want to be under God's sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent
Although her brother and mother were hesitating, wanting her to stay for at least ten days, she said, 'I will go'
Some spent days, weeks, months, and even years considering whether a particular brother was the one whom God had prepared for them
If they had not been hospitable but rather had rejected Abraham's servant, that wonderful marriage would never have taken place
They accepted the Lord's sovereignty, saying, 'The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good'
Laban and Bethuel recognized that this was the Lord's doing and that they had no right to say anything about it
Some versions interpret it as meaning that Isaac went to the field to pray, and others say that he went to the field to worship
After the servant had told Isaac all that had happened, Isaac took what his father had done for him and married Rebekah
In the New Testament we cannot find a verse which says that this marriage is a type of Christ marrying the church
The New Testament clearly reveals that Isaac, the son of Abraham, was a type of Christ being Abraham's unique seed
Based upon the fact that Isaac was a type of Christ, we may infer that Isaac's marriage was a type of the marriage of Christ
Because the Bible is a divine book composed with the divine concepts, we can see these concepts in the various biblical records
The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, working together to obtain the bride for the Son
In the Acts and Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father's plan to obtain the bride for the Son
According to the King James Version, Ephesians 3:11 speaks of 'the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord'
In typology, this indicates that the counterpart of Christ must come from Christ's race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures
As Abraham commissioned his servant to reach the chosen bride , so God the Father commissioned God the Spirit to reach the human race
As that person was preaching the gospel to you, you were attracted by what he said and were willing to receive it
In our mentality, many of us said, 'I don't like this,' but deep within our spirit we said, 'This is very good'
Before we ever heard the preaching of the gospel or came to a gospel meeting, the Holy Spirit was already there waiting
In Genesis 24 we see a servant who was thirsty after his long journey and in John 4 we see a Savior who was thirsty after His tiring journey
When we heard the preaching of the gospel in the past, we did not realize that the Holy Spirit was thirsty for us
As you were listening to the preaching of the gospel, did you not sense that someone was desirous of having you?
On the one hand, you said, 'I don't like this'; on the other hand, something deep within you said, 'You cannot run away'
As Rebekah went to draw water from the well that day, she was completely innocent, having no idea of what was to happen to her
She did not realize that by giving a man a drink of water and by drawing water for his camels she would be caught
After the camels had finished drinking, the servant put a golden ring on Rebekah's nose and two bracelets upon her hands
In these verses, the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will not speak of Himself, but that He will glorify the Son
Suppose Abraham's servant had said to Laban, 'It is difficult for Abraham to earn a living in Canaan, and his son Isaac is not healthy
Today we realize the riches of Christ, which He has received of the Father, through the gifts that the Spirit has dispensed to us
After the servant, typifying the Spirit, brought Rebekah the riches, she was convinced and was willing to marry Isaac
Although her relatives wanted her to linger, Rebekah, upon hearing the servant's testimony of Isaac, said, 'I will go'
Although it is a long journey, eventually He will bring us through and present us to Christ as His lovely bride
Sometimes he even lies to us through preachers who speak negative things and tell us that we cannot love the Lord Jesus
Often we have unconsciously done what the Holy Spirit expected, satisfying His desire, doing it without knowing what He expected
He appraises her nose, saying, 'Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus,' and, 'The smell of thy nose like apples'
In Song of Songs 2:3, the seeker says, 'As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons
As the book of Hebrews says, we have tasted of the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age
The two bracelets given to Rebekah were ten shekels in weight and thus could fulfill the requirements of God's commandments
The taste which we have received of the Holy Spirit is only partial, but the divine function which we have received of Him is complete
Rebekah also received articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment , all of which indicate the riches of Christ
By all these details we can realize that the record in Genesis 24 is altogether divine and implies the divine concept
After receiving and enjoying all these riches, Rebekah followed the servant, traveling through the desert on a camel until she met Isaac
Rebekah traveled through the desert on top of a camel, and we are traveling through the desert on today's modern 'camels'
Forty years after Isaac's birth, Abraham married again , and when he became one hundred forty years of age, he still begat six sons
As we have seen, God's purpose is to work Himself into a corporate person that He might have a corporate expression
After the fourth fall, God came in to call Abraham out of the fallen race and establish him as the father of the called race
God's intention in making Abraham the father of the called race was to work Himself into that race for the fulfillment of His purpose
The record from the last half of chapter eleven through the first part of chapter twenty-five shows how much God worked with this person
When we come to the end of the record of Abraham's life, do we see a person who was matured in life and who expressed God in every way?
Chapter twenty-four is wonderful, but it is not wonderful with respect to Abraham's life but with respect to his activity
Abraham did a wonderful thing in choosing a proper wife for his son; yet, immediately after this, he remarried
One day, he called Isaac and Rebekah to him, laid his hands upon them, blessed them, and then went to be with the Lord'
Abraham's life may be divided into three sections: the section with Ishmael, the section with Isaac, and the section with the six sons
None of the other sons were reckoned as heirs , for they were all sons of the concubine and, like Ishmael, were rejected by God
He was called, had faith, and lived in fellowship with God, but, to use a New Testament term, he did not have sufficient transformation
As water flows through the wood, the element of wood is carried away and the elements of minerals are added in its place
If you read chapters twenty-three through twenty-five again, you will see that Abraham was not a fully transformed person
He was a man who lived in fellowship with God and who acted according to His leading, but he was not transformed in full
Rather, he remarried and exercised the flesh which had been dealt with by God to bring forth six more 'Ishmaels'
His two sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , which he had obtained for Sarah in chapter twenty-three
According to the implication of the divine record, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals
Their God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not three gods but the one Triune God
When Abraham was in Chaldea worshipping idols, that was the time of God's calling, not the time of His selection
In other words, as far as the experience of life is concerned, by himself Abraham cannot stand as a complete person in the eyes of God
If we are not matured in life, although we may be quite active, doing many things, all our labor will be in vain
As the record at the end of Genesis reveals, Jacob, although he could not see well, blessed in a very clear way
Because Jacob was mature, he blessed everyone he met, including Pharaoh, who was an unbeliever, a Gentile king
Jacob could bless his sons in a way that was full of divine revelation because he was fully matured in the divine life
Whatever he spoke was the divine word, and whatever he blessed was a prophecy concerning God's economy with all His children
At the end of Genesis we see a man called Israel, a transformed person who is transparent, clear, and full of life
As we have been robbed with Abraham and have been enjoying with Isaac, one day we all shall be matured with Jacob
When you have matured, you will not complain; you will bless, saying, 'O God, bless all the brothers and all the churches'
The Triune God is working within us as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to make us the full expression of Himself
He is the Triune God, and we must be a person of three aspects in the spiritual experiences of the divine life
As we read the record of his life in chapters twenty-one through twenty-eight, what do we see of the experience of life?
After Christ came, there is a full and thorough revelation of grace, and in the New Testament the word grace is used again and again
Although the record in Genesis concerning Isaac does not have the term grace, nevertheless such a thing is implied there
Although Isaac's experience is recorded in Genesis, it is difficult to designate the experience he had as the experience of grace
Abraham represents the aspect of being called, of living by faith in God, and of living in fellowship with God
Jacob represents the aspect of being chosen, being dealt with by the Lord, and being transformed into a prince of God
Most of us have heard messages saying that the Christian life should be a suffering life, a life of bearing the cross and groaning in prayer
Eliezer, in whom he trusted, was rejected, and Ishmael, the son he begat by his own endeavor with his concubine, was cast out
Before we can have the experience of Isaac, we need Abraham who represents the first aspect of the experience of life
Abraham's self and natural man were the strongest frustration to God's blessing and forced God to deal with him
Being called by God, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God are all for the enjoyment of God
We all have had at least some experience of being called by God, living by faith in God, living in fellowship with God, and suffering loss
Abraham acquired a great deal, having been blessed and having become enlarged, but he gave all that he had to Isaac
As Abraham, we have been called by God, have learned to live by faith in God, and have learned to live in fellowship with God
Because of the lack of revelation, Christians have misunderstood and misinterpreted grace, thinking of it as something outside of them
If we love others in ourselves, God will never recognize that love, because it does not come from His visitation
As we have seen, God's intention is to work Himself into a corporate man that He might have a corporate expression
God's purpose is to work Himself into us to be our life and even to be our living, but our natural self frustrates this
His intention is to deal with our natural being that we may have the full experience of Himself in Christ wrought into us as our enjoyment
God the Spirit is the Spirit of grace and this grace is the grace of life which is the varied grace the all grace and the sufficient grace
It is the Spirit of grace indwelling our spirit to be our enjoyment that we may enjoy God as our life and our everything, even as our living
Whatever we call it, the Spirit of grace or the grace of life, it is something living and divine in our spirit
In the Old Testament, God gave many things to His people as blessings, but all those things were merely outward blessings
Christ came not only to die on the cross for us, but, after His death, to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into our being
To grow in grace is to grow in the enjoyment of all that Christ is to us as our spiritual food and living water
He was not required to do anything that he might inherit the father's riches and he did not do anything for the inheritance
In Christ He has put us into grace that we might become the heirs of grace inheriting all the riches of the divine fullness as our enjoyment
Our Christian life must be like Isaac's, doing nothing by himself, but inheriting and enjoying all that the father has
In this kingdom God can be fully expressed in the seed, into which He will work Himself and which will be transformed into His image
Through our enjoyment of grace the kingdom of God will be realized and God in Christ will be fully expressed for eternity
We thank the Lord that in the Old Testament He has given us a wonderful and clear picture of the experience of life
If we did not have this clear view, we would only consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate individuals
The first item in our experience of God is His selection, His choice, which was made before the foundation of the world
In a sense, we are all Abrahams, for we have been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him
We have not only been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him, but we are daily enjoying something of God
Praise the Lord that we not only have the aspect of Abraham but also the aspect of Isaac, which is the aspect of grace
From the moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior, we began to have these two aspects in our experience
When he was old, he still had the taste for 'savoury meat' and asked Esau to go out to the field and prepare him the meat which he loved
When Rebekah heard this, she called Jacob to fetch her two kids of the goats that she might prepare the meat for Isaac
If he had stayed in Lahai-roi, not returning to Beer-sheba or Hebron, he would have missed that meeting with Rebekah
His son Isaac also had trouble when he went to Philistia, for he had contention and enmity with the Philistines
Even when Isaac went downward to Lahai-roi, he still enjoyed a well, the well of the living One who sees us and reveals Himself to us
Lahai-roi was a place where one who had left the standing of grace could still have some enjoyment of God's visitation
In the past we might have questioned whether our standing was right, feeling that we were somewhat removed from the standing of grace
Although the enjoyment is our destiny, we may have it on an improper ground, at Beer-lahai-roi, not at Beer-sheba
In the past, many of us held the religious concept that if we are wrong, God will give us up and we shall not have any more enjoyment
You may have a well for your enjoyment, but you will miss the Lord's appearing and be unable to fulfill God's eternal purpose
If we do, we shall experience the Lord's appearing and have the ground to inherit the promises to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Although we may have wells, even 'a well of living water' , in other places, those wells cannot enable us to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Isaac had been going down, but God used the circumstances to force him to come up from Beer-lahai-roi to Beer-sheba
Some Christian teachers have encouraged the believers to follow the example of Isaac and not to strive with others
According to this teaching, when we dig a well and others take it, we should simply tolerate it and give it to them
If we go to another place and dig another well and others take it over, we should not fight for it but go to still another place
At Beer-sheba, after the Lord's appearing, Isaac built an altar, called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent
Only in the unique place, in Beer-sheba, could he inherit the promise and have a life of testimony for the fulfillment of God's purpose
The enjoyment which we may have everywhere because it is our destiny is not a confirmation or a justification of our standing
In many places we have had the enjoyment, but when we were there, we had the deep sense that we did not have the Lord's appearing
In those places we did not have an altar or a tent, and we did not call upon the Lord's name from deep within our spirit
Did God not say in His promise that Isaac, the only seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed?
Eventually, Isaac had a son, Jacob, who not only fulfilled Isaac's need but also fulfilled God's eternal purpose
All these eternal things came about through the meeting of Isaac's need, a need which corresponded with God's need
In the enjoyment of God's grace, we must render Him our human coordination that He may fulfill His eternal purpose through us
He will use our circumstances to bring us back to the proper standing that the fulfillment of His purpose might be realized
After receiving the hundredfold harvest, he found the 'well of living water' and came into the 'broad places,' the 'broad ways'
Now we must see that with this grace-enjoying person there were still the natural weakness and the natural life
According to our natural, religious concept, we always think that if we are natural, we cannot have the enjoyment of grace
Probably none of us has ever thought that participating in the grace of God does not depend upon our being spiritual
Isaac also loved Esau partially, loving him because he was a skillful hunter and could obtain the venison which Isaac loved
Jacob learned how to supplant from his supplanting mother, and his supplanting mother was the supplanting completion to his father Isaac
According to our natural concept, a person who has a natural weakness and who lives in the natural life can never enjoy the grace of God
Do not think that if you are spiritual you are privileged to enjoy Gods grace and that if you are not spiritual you cannot enjoy His grace
If we are spiritual, we shall not enjoy grace more, and if we are unspiritual we shall not miss the grace of God
Do you believe that a man who had such an enjoyment of God's grace could still have the natural weakness of lying in a substantial way?
When Isaac plainly told Esau that if he would prepare venison for him he would bless him, he was not conscious of being religious
Before Isaac was exposed in chapter twenty-six, he probably never realized that his natural weakness was the same as Abraham's
You yourself may not know your own natural weakness, but it is clear to everyone else because it has been exposed to them
Peter, John, and Paul all had their weaknesses, but their weak points did not frustrate them from enjoying God's grace
Isaac's intention might have been to go down into Egypt, but God commanded him to dwell in the land of which He would tell him
My burden in this message is to tell you that the enjoyment of God's grace does not depend upon our being religious
Isaac's love for his firstborn son was altogether in the natural life according to his natural taste, as was Jacob's love for Joseph
Esau, a 'skillful hunter' , was a father's boy, and Jacob, a 'quiet man' who dwelt in tents , was a mother's boy
When Isaac felt him, this caused him to say, 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau'
In a sense, the mother cheated the father, meaning that the second part of a person cheated the first part of the same person
It is difficult to believe that a person like Isaac could still have such a natural weakness and still live in such a natural life
Both Isaac and Rebekah suffered because they lived in a natural way, for Esau's wives were 'a bitterness of spirit' to them
When Rebekah heard of this, she told Jacob to flee to her brother Laban and to stay with him until Esau's anger had turned away
He blessed blindly, not only physically but also spiritually, because he had been blinded by his natural taste
Whenever you want to exercise faith, you should not look at yourself, at what you are, nor at your environment
He did not consider what he was; he looked away to God and to God's promise, blessing his son by faith and in the spirit
Before he died, he must have charged his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were buried
According to the New Testament revelation, the experience of God does not begin with God's calling but with His selection
As we shall see, Jacob stands for the transformed life and Joseph represents the ruling aspect, the kingly aspect, of this transformed life
According to the New Testament revelation, the believers were firstly chosen by God in eternity past before the foundation of the world
In God's calling, which follows His predestination, we receive forgiveness, redemption, justification, regeneration, and full salvation
Day by day we are under the process of God's transformation to be brought not only into the full sonship but also into the kingship
We were born sons of God, the royal sons, and we are undergoing the process of God's transformation that in the future we might be kings
In other words, Abraham's record has neither the beginning nor the ending of the experience of God, both of which are with Jacob
If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the name of Israel ultimately appears in the New Jerusalem
We should not consider them as four separate individuals, but as four different aspects of one's complete experience
In Abraham, we have God's calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God
The two children were fighting, and the mother, being unable to tolerate it, inquired of the Lord concerning it
If he had known that he had been chosen, he would have had no need to struggle and could have told Esau, 'Esau, you may go out first
Romans 9:11, referring to Jacob and Esau, says, 'The children not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, '
Before the children had done neither good nor bad, God had told Rebekah, the mother, that the 'greater shall serve the less'
In Romans 9 Paul replying to the opposers seemed to be saying Dont you realize that you are just a piece of clay and that God is the Potter
God might have said to Satan, 'Satan, don't you realize that this is a very good opportunity for Me to show My mercy?
We all can testify that though we were most pitiful and miserable, God came in and granted us His mercy and we repented
Now we are not only under God's mercy; we also have His grace, the living person of Christ as the Spirit, within us
In the record of Jacob's life, we see something which can be designated as mercy and something which can be designated as grace
We do not see the beginning of the experience of God in Abraham; neither do we see the adequate ending of the proper life in his experience
The genuine beginning did not start in Chaldea; it started with God's selection before the foundation of the world
They may say, 'We have been saved to live a happy life, to have peace and joy today, and to go to heaven in the future'
Genesis 126 reveals that Gods purpose in His creation of man was that man might express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion
As priests, we bear the image of God to express Him, and as kings, we have the dominion of God to represent Him
Now, we are daily undergoing the process of transformation that we might bear the full image of God and exercise His authority
Of the fifty chapters in the book of Genesis, twenty-five and a half are devoted to the record of Jacob with Joseph
The book of Genesis contains the biographies of nine great persons: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph
Enoch's biography is less than half a chapter in length, and the biography of Enosh occupies only a few verses
The reason Jacob's record is so long is that in the experience of life nothing takes as long a time as transformation does
When Jacob deceived him, he knew that something was wrong, for he said, 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau'
In 25:19-34; 27:1-46; and 28:1-5, we see four persons Jacob, Esau, Isaac, and Rebekah each of whom is distinct from the others
Later we shall see that Laban as well as Jacob's wives, maids, sons, and daughter were used by God to transform him
Every circumstance, situation, and person found in the record of Jacob's life was used to transform this supplanter into a prince of God
Esau, on the contrary, was not so intelligent, but he was physically strong and defeated his brother, not allowing him to be born first
If Jacob had had both a smart mind and great physical strength Esau could not have done anything and Jacob could have had whatever he wanted
Sometimes the sisters are defeated by their husbands, but, refusing to admit defeat, they hold on to the husband's heel
Jacob was a quiet man who always exercised his mind, and Esau was a hunter who exercised his physical strength
As we have seen, when Jacob was in his mother's womb, he struggled and was under the dealing of God's sovereign hand
If she had not been watching, how could she have overheard the conversation between Isaac and Esau regarding the blessing ?
Because Isaac and Rebekah were so different from one another, Jacob obtained the birthright and received the blessing
The simple father, the ingenious mother, and the rude and careless brother caused Jacob to suffer and to be dealt with
He has chosen and predestinated us, and now we are under His sovereign hand that we might be dealt with day after day
We all have been chosen to express God in His image, represent Him with His dominion, and participate in His kingdom
Due to his love of physical enjoyments, that is, his love for the world and the worldly enjoyments, Esau despised his birthright
If they cared for God's expression, representation, and kingdom, they would stay in the proper church life, which is God's kingdom today
All that Esau Rebekah and Isaac were and did worked together for Jacobs good that God might sovereignly fulfill the purpose of His selection
We must learn the lesson of not exercising our natural ability and our natural strength to fulfill God's intention and to satisfy our desire
He does not do this simply by His creating hand, but by a long process which can only be carried out through all the circumstances of life
Even when Isaac realized that something was wrong when Jacob came to him disguised as Esau, he only cared for his eating
These three persons worked together to cause Jacob to leave his loving mother and his father's home and to become a lonesome wanderer
If you consider your past with the proper understanding, you will realize that your experience was exactly the same as Jacob's
According to their understanding, everything man-made was useless, and they trusted in God's creation, in the things made by God
When the brothers give you a difficult time or when your wife troubles you, the heavenly dream will probably come once again
God sovereignly came in to force him to leave his home, bringing him into a situation where he was lonely and without the help of man
Do not think that in his dream Jacob saw the ladder descending like Peter saw the sheet descending from heaven
We are not told that the ladder reached the earth but that it was 'set up on the earth' and that 'the top of it reached to heaven'
For nineteen and a half centuries, people have tried their best to shake this ladder, but they have been unable to do it
Our Christ, who is the ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, is now not only in heaven but also here on earth
Christ has been set up on earth and He is reaching into heaven for the purpose of coming to us and bringing us to Him
As we have already pointed out, in Jacob's dream the angels of God were ascending and descending on the ladder
Christ, the sent One, the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven, is here on earth right now
Many of us can testify that on some occasions we had such a wonderful time with the Lord that we had no words to describe what was happening
Whenever we have a vision, we may not have the understanding or the words to describe it, but we sense that a ladder is before us
The center of every spiritual dream is Christ as the ladder, as the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven
If we know the Bible, we shall realize that here there is a radical turn, a new start, in the divine revelation
When Peter first came to the Lord, the Lord changed his name saying, 'You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas '
Speaking of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:11 says, 'Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal'
Transformation is not merely a change in form; it is also a change in nature, for the word transformation denotes a metabolic change
After Jacob had awakened out of his sleep, he realized that this place was not only the house of God but also the gate of heaven
The word add in Matthew 6:33 implies that something basic has already been given and that other things are simply added to us
In this passage, Jacob firstly found rest and ultimately he received the promise that there would be no problem regarding food and clothing
Although it is good to be born into such a godly family, we must still have our own direct, personal meeting with God
He had been born into a godly family, but before the dream at Bethel, he himself had had no direct meeting with God
Knowing the God of Abraham means that we are justified, and knowing the God of Isaac means that we enjoy the grace of God
After we came into the church and began to sing of the glorious church life, things began to happen one after another
It firstly is that we shall have the land and the seed and that we shall be a blessing to all the families of the earth
In addition to this, we became a blessing to others, to our neighbors, relatives, friends, and everyone around us
Although Jacob did not actually see the house of God, he termed what he saw the house of God, saying, 'This is the house of God'
In the Bible, the stone undoubtedly signifies a transformed man, a lump of clay which has been transformed into a stone
The stone which was set up as a pillar and which had the oil poured upon it, is a symbol that the transformed man is one with the Triune God
When Jacob promised to give the tenth to God, it meant that if God did not give anything to him, then he would not give anything to God
If the Holy Spirit were to write an account of your experience, it would probably be exactly the same as Jacob's
As we read Jacob's record in the book of Genesis, we need to remember that the whole Bible is the word of life
Since the whole Bible is the word of God as life, we should not consider the stories in the Bible as mere stories
Most Christians have considered the stories in the book of Genesis merely as stories, neglecting the life found in them
In Abraham, we see God's calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God
In the experience of God there are not only Gods calling justification faith and fellowship we also have been selected and predestinated
The New Testament reveals clearly that we have been predestinated to be the sons of God , even the royal sons of God
In the book of Revelation we are told that the saints will even be co-kings with Christ to rule over the nations in the kingdom
Genesis 1:26 reveals that God's goal in His creation of man was for man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His dominion
These three people worked together as a team to chase Jacob away, forcing him to leave his loving mother and his father's home
We know that Jacob suffered on his journey by the fact that he 'lifted up his voice and wept' when he saw his cousin Rachel
All that he had experienced prior to coming to Laban's home was simply to bring him into the room of transformation
After traveling a very long distance, Jacob came to a certain place, supposing it to be the place where his uncle Laban lived
It says that he came to just one place and that he immediately discovered that it was the place where Laban lived
When Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebekah's son, she ran and told her father
Laban was not born accidentally; he was born according to God's preparation for the sake of Jacob's transformation
Jacob, who loved Rachel, was honest with Laban and said, 'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter'
Jacob also was quite clever, realizing that if he had proposed a short term of employment, Laban would not have agreed to the deal
Because he was afraid of losing Rachel, Jacob offered to work for Laban for seven years that he might have her as his wife
The Bible does not say that after the seven years were expired, Laban called Jacob and told him that it was time to marry Rachel
When Jacob discovered the next morning that Laban had cheated him, he said, 'What is this thou hast done unto me?
Jacob did not care for Leah, whose eyes were dull; he loved Rachel who was 'beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance'
After Jacob had complained to him, Laban said, 'It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn
Jacob agreed to this arrangement, having been beguiled by Laban to work a total of fourteen years for Rachel, the wife of his preference
Your preference will always cost you a great deal, for besides giving it to you, God will give you an addition
Rachel was Jacob's wife according to his choice and preference, but Leah was his wife according to God's concept and will
God will permit you to have your choice, but along with it, you will have a certain amount of dealing and transformation
As we have seen, Rachel, the wife of his choice, was not his real wife; his real wife was Leah, the one he did not like
Because of the rivalry between Rachel and Leah, their two maids, Bilhah and Zilpah, were given to Jacob as wives
In all of human history, there probably has not been another time when a father-in-law has played such a trick on his son-in-law
During the night, Jacob was dreaming of having his choice, but when the day dawned, he saw that he had been given the one he did not like
When Leah gave birth to her firstborn, Reuben, whose name means 'See a son,' she said, 'Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction'
In other words she had wrestled in the presence of God and after the birth of Naphtali she thought that she had prevailed and won the case
In a good sense, Leah was fortunate because she had borne Jacob four sons herself and two more through her maid
Deep within, Leah must have thought that Issachar was born because she had hired Jacob by giving Reuben's mandrakes to Rachel
Giving birth to Benjamin as she was dying, Rachel 'called his name Benoni: but his father called his name Benjamin'
Although Jacob gained these two sons, God never allowed him to have Rachel, his dear wife, and these two favorite sons at the same time
All the main items in 30:25-43 and 31:1-16, 38-42 can be classified under three headings: Laban's squeeze, Jacob's trick, and God's blessing
If we would see the life in this section of the Word and receive the supply of life it contains we must pay attention to these three parties
Only by our being placed, by God's sovereign arrangement, into a certain environment and under the hand of certain people
Although God has chosen us, we are supplanters, heelholders, and must be transformed, whether we like it or not
After a while, Laban might have discovered that Jacob was quite smart and that he could be very profitable to him
He trapped Jacob to labor for him fourteen years for his two daughters and then he charged him to labor six years for his flock
When he did escape, he was afraid to tell Laban that he was leaving, fearing that Laban would rob him of his wives, children, and flocks
Isaac, Rebekah, and Esau were used by God to put Jacob into the transformation oven, and Laban was the fire burning in this oven
Laban was very crafty with Jacob, saying that he had learned that by having Jacob stay with him, he had received the Lord's blessing
Now we see that Jacob, who had suffered Laban's squeeze, had a way to steal Laban's wealth and make himself rich
Laban removed from his flock all the cattle which were not purely white and gave them into the hand of his sons
Jacob then set these striped rods before the flocks in the watering troughs, 'that they should conceive when they came to drink'
In 30:39 we are told that 'the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle striped, speckled, and spotted'
When the stronger cattle conceived Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
Apparently Jacob gained the riches of the flock by his trick; actually, these riches came by God's sovereignty
Jacob's dream in chapter thirty-one reveals that it was God's sovereignty that actually produced these results
If God had not been sovereign in that situation and had not given Jacob the birthright, Jacob never could have obtained it through trickery
Apparently Jacob gained these riches through the success of his trickery actually they were given to him by Gods sovereign blessing hand
Rather, we must realize that every blessing, whether spiritual or material, has come through God's sovereignty
As we have pointed out, in this record there are three main parties: the squeezing party, the trick-playing party, and the blessing party
God might have said to Jacob, 'Jacob, you did not become rich because of your tricks, but because of My sovereign blessing
You put the white cattle in front of the striped branches, but the dream indicates that the results did not come because of your tricks
In the dream, God did not rebuke him; rather, He comforted him, saying, 'I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee'
God saw Jacob's suffering and affliction under Laban's hand and seemed to say, 'I am the God of Bethel, the God of your father
After traveling on a long journey, Jacob, being tired and lonesome, took a stone, made it his pillow, and slept in the open air
Under the light of the whole Bible, we know that this young supplanter was chosen by God and was predestinated to have the birthright
While Jacob, the young supplanter who had gotten into trouble due to his supplanting, was on his lonesome journey, he had a dream
As we have seen in Jacob's heavenly dream four things were revealed: the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil
When we were studying chapter eleven, we pointed out that bricks signify human work, the issue of human effort with clay
Approximately three years later, the Lord questioned His disciples, saying, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is'?
In saying this, the Lord reminded Peter of what He had done three years ago in changing his name from Simon to Cephas
Later, in writing his first Epistle, Peter said, 'You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house'
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul held a similar concept, telling the believers at Corinth that they were God's building
As we come to the book of Revelation, the ultimate end of the Bible, we see a city built up with precious stones
If you are a dirty person, you will have a dirty house, and if you are a clean person, you will have a clean house
If you visit a house in which a Japanese family lives, you will know, simply by walking through it, that it is inhabited by Japanese
Although we cannot understand it according to the outward word, we can understand it according to our inward experience
On that day, something divine, something of Christ, was wrought into us and became the solid support within us
He cannot have rest until the stone upon which we rest our head has been set up to be a pillar for His building
Is the very Christ whom you have experienced merely your rest, or is He the building material for God's house?
A short while after coming into the church, we set up our experience of Christ as a pillar, turning it into worthy material for God's house
What an experience of oil we have had since we came into the church life and our pillow stood up to become a pillar!
Since coming into the church and testifying how much we love the church, we find that whenever we are individualistic, we lose the dessert
The genuine experience of Christ becomes the building material, and this building material consummates in the building of the house of God
Jacob's dream was first fulfilled when the children of Israel erected the tabernacle after being delivered out of Egypt
Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth, we shall have the New Jerusalem as God's eternal dwelling place
Do you truly believe that Genesis 31, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is the breath of God?
Do you believe that a subtle man like Jacob could become the precious material for the building of God's house on earth?
We may find this disappointing, saying, 'If the process of transformation cannot be completed in twenty years, then how long will it take?
At the beginning of these twenty years, he was truly a supplanter, but at the end of that time, he was at least somewhat transformed
If not even the tail of the natural man remained, he would have said nothing except, 'Praise the Lord, Uncle Laban'
The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, 'We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him'
Although the Lord will certainly answer this prayer, He will not answer it according to our way, but according to His way
If you study the biography of Jacob, you will see that even when he was in his mother's womb God began to deal with him
As Jacob worshipped God, the supplanting hands now leaned upon the top of his staff, the sign of his pilgrim life on earth
The Lord Jesus can save us instantaneously we can consecrate ourselves quickly and we may even come into the church life in a very fast way
During the past twenty years, Laban's countenance might have smiled upon Jacob because Jacob was a cause of his profit
They negotiated and agreed upon the terms according to which Jacob would remain with Laban for another period of time
After several more years had passed Laban realized that all the increase was on Jacobs side and thus he changed his countenance toward Jacob
Because it was time for Jacob to go back, God arranged for his cousins to express their attitude and for Laban to change his countenance
He probably would have told Jacob, 'Jacob, if you want to go, then go, but you must leave everyone and everything with me'
If we examine ourselves, we shall see that many times we have done things without letting our husbands or wives know about them
If the Bible did not mention these idols, no one would have ever believed that Laban or Jacob had idols in his family
Next, Laban accused Jacob of stealing his images , and then, after the images were not found, Jacob rebuked Laban for his mistreatment
After this, Laban was subdued and, being subtle, he changed his attitude and made a covenant of peace with Jacob
In chapter twenty-seven, Jacob's mother, Rebekah, thought that Laban would be a protection and help to her beloved son, Jacob
The crucial character is neither Laban nor Jacob, but the hidden God who sovereignly prepares our environment for our transformation
Because Laban told him that God had warned him not to hurt Jacob, Jacob took the opportunity to boldly rebuke him
It was difficult for him to remain with Laban and it was just as difficult for him to return to the place where Esau was
When Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's camp: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim,' which means two camps
Rather, Jacob, who still trusted in his self-striving , imitated God's two camps of angels by dividing his people into two camps
Of exercising our spirit to pray, we exercise our mind to consider and our natural strength to face every problem
The most he could do was divide his people into two groups, thinking that if the first were sacrificed, the second might be spared
He seemed to be saying, 'Lord, my capacity is so small that it cannot contain all Your lovingkindness and faithfulness'
God had chosen Jacob with the goal of having seed for the fulfillment of His purpose to have a corporate expression of Himself on earth
Much to Jacob's surprise, in the depths of the night, while he was desperate, a man came to him trying His best to pin him down
The Lord did not subdue him immediately so that He might expose to Jacob how natural he was and how great his natural strength was
Jacob still trusted in himself and exercised his natural skill and ability to save himself from the difficult situation
After all the Lord's promises, after his prayer, and after wrestling with the Lord, Jacob still had something new to do
He put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last'
Verse 3 says, 'And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother'
Jacob's coming to him in this manner greatly surprised Esau who 'ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him'
Esau did not come to Jacob with hatred or with the desire for vengeance; rather, he came with warm, brotherly love
As long as we are on the way to reach God's goal and as long as we have His promise as His chosen ones, everything is all right
As we have seen, the second division of his people was according to his heart's desire to preserve Rachel and Joseph
You saw His angels and He Himself even wrestled with you, changed your name to Israel, and gave you a blessing
During the previous twenty years he had neither the altar nor the tent indicating that he did not have the proper life as a testimony of God
We see that this chosen one of God has been brought back by Gods grace to the proper standing for the fulfillment of Gods eternal purpose
By the Lord's mercy, in this message we must consider this vital experience in Jacob's life and be helped by it
There is no verse which says, 'While Jacob remained there alone considering his trouble, the Lord came to wrestle with him'
It simply says, 'There wrestled a man with him,' indicating that the man was already there and that there was no need for him to come
Having been released from the usurping hand of Laban, he was now desperate as he faced the coming confrontation with his brother, Esau
According to Jacob's understanding, if Esau was coming to welcome him, there would have been no need of the four hundred men
While Jacob was considering how to cope with his problem, much to his surprise, a man began to wrestle with him
The Lord must have wrestled with Jacob for at least six hours, perhaps beginning at midnight and continuing until dawn
In this portion of the Word, we do not have an appearing of the God of glory; neither do we have a visitation from the Lord
When you were saved, the Lord appeared to you, and many times after that you have had sweet and pleasant visitations of the Lord
Eventually, we realize that it is not a matter of our husband, our wife, or of one of the elders; it is God who is here dealing with us
In His appearing for our salvation, the Lord reveals Himself as the Lord of glory, but in His dealings with us, He keeps Himself secret
Whenever we undergo a dealing, we think that it comes from a person or a situation; we do not consider it as coming from the Lord
Many Christians know that Israel means 'the Prince of God,' but, as the best lexicons and translations make clear, this meaning is secondary
After Jacob heard that his name had been changed to Israel, a wrestler with God, he immediately realized that this wrestler was God
After the Lord blessed him, Jacob fully realized that the wrestler was God and he named that place Peniel, which means 'the face of God'
Although there was no change in his way of living, there definitely was a change in his life, his very life had been touched
Both before and after the Lord touched him, he could do anything, but after the Lord touched him, whatever he did was done with a limp
With Jacob, the touch occurred in chapter thirty-two, but the maturity, the ripening, was not fully manifested until chapter forty-seven
After being touched by God in chapter thirtythree apparently he had not changed very much but actually in life he had had a great change
It was not the outward living that was touched by the Lord; it was the inward, natural strength that was touched by Him
The Lord is not only concerned with changing our outward living; He desires even more to touch our natural life
Whether or not you exchange words with your wife, if your natural life has not been touched, you are still natural
Once Jacob had been touched, though outwardly he was the same as before, inwardly his natural life had been dealt with
Among the thousands of people in the church life, there are many different kinds: the clever, the wise, the crafty, the proud, the arrogant
From now on, you must not exercise your craftiness or use your natural strength to face the situation with your brother, Esau
The sisters who engage in shepherding may charge others, saying, 'Sister, you should not exchange words with your husband any longer
Because we are truly in the Lord's hand and are following His way, many of us are having this kind of experience
Although he was willing to return to the land of his fathers, he had to confront the great problem of facing his brother Esau
Taking the word of the Lord and utilizing his skill and cleverness, he stole away from Laban, not informing him that he was leaving
Because of this, he had a long night of wrestling with an unidentified opponent who actually was the Lord Himself
After he had been delivered out of all these troubles, 'Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle'
In God's eyes, when Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house there, he had not yet come back to the heart of the good land
By Jacob's building a house for himself and booths for his cattle, we see how much Jacob was still natural and for himself
When Jacob was a stranger in a foreign land, we could sympathize with him, for it is difficult for anyone to be an alien
In Shechem on the contrary he built nothing for himself or for his cattle rather he built an altar for God and erected a tent for his living
How good it was that he not only followed the steps of his forefather, but also had the tent life and the altar testimony
Although Esau came to him with an honest and good heart, Jacob, even after he had been broken, was still supplanting
Supplanting until the very last minute, Jacob arrived safely at Shechem, where he began to live a tent life with an altar testimony
We have an absolute consecration and build an altar; then we continue until we come to the building of the church, the house of God
Although what Jacob had at Shechem was good, he still needed the dealing in his circumstances because he had not yet come back to Bethel
For one of eleven daughters to be defiled would have meant a great deal less than for his only daughter to be defiled
By going to see the daughters of the land, she found herself in difficulty, and this unfortunate event took place
Jacob and his household might have thought it was, but in God's eyes it was not; it took place under His sovereign hand
It means that this unfortunate occurrence transpired under the sovereign hand of God to perfect Jacob, His chosen one
Gods purpose with Jacob was not that Jacob might follow his forefathers footsteps erect a tent build an altar be strengthened and be settled
Eventually, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, slew all the males in the city of Shechem and plundered the city
He was following the track of the pioneer of God's called ones, living in a tent and worshipping God by an altar
How could this happen to a man who had just begun to live the life of God's called ones, the life of a tent with an altar?
They slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out'
After this, they went on to plunder the city and to seize all the sheep, oxen, asses, wealth, wives, and children
In Genesis 34 this one was the unique person in, with, and through whom God's eternal purpose was to be fulfilled
If you have the insight, you will be able to see that even today the Lord is sacrificing many others that you might be perfected
My purpose is that you go to the place where you had the dream, the place where you vowed to build a house for Me
When he was old and was bestowing his blessing on his twelve sons, he was unable to forget what Simeon and Levi had done
According to Jacob's word, Simeon and Levi not only killed men but also hamstrung oxen, cutting the nerves to cripple them
He was also rescued out of his trouble with Esau, and came to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and booths for his cattle
Today, nearly all seeking Christians are like Jacob, living a good life in Shechem but neglecting God's goal in Bethel
As a book of consummation, nearly everything in Revelation is something previously mentioned in the Old Testament
According to the black and white letters, we do not see anything related to God's building in Revelation 4 and 5
In the same principle, if we would know what the seven eyes of God are, we must also go back to the Old Testament
The angel answered This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying Not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
The book of Revelation tells us clearly that these seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps, are the seven Spirits of God
Zechariah reveals that the seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps on the lampstand, are also the seven eyes of the stone
By means of the seven eyes, Christ as the Lion and the Lamb unveiled in Revelation 5 is connected to the stone spoken of in Zechariah 3
He is the Lion-Lamb-stone: the Lion to destroy the enemy, the Lamb to redeem us, and the stone to build God's house
The previous verse says, 'This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone'
Jesus Christ, the One who was crucified and raised from the dead, is the stone set at naught by the Jewish builders
In Isaiah 28:16 Christ is the foundation stone, in Zechariah 4:7 He is the topstone, and in Acts 4:10-12 He is the cornerstone
We not only see, as Martin Luther saw, that the Christ is the Lamb for our redemption for us to be justified by faith in Him
Redemption is the process by which fallen man is brought back to God for the fulfillment of God's economy to build His dwelling place
The answer is in verse 22 of the same psalm: 'The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner'
The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, 'Didn't you hear the people praising Me, saying, Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord'?
The book of Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is God's tabernacle and that there God Himself and the Lamb are the temple
For some, tongue speaking is a cottage; for others, holiness is a house; and for still others, spirituality is a shed
Because of this, we have the boldness to say that we in the Lord's recovery are the unique Christians caring for God's building
As long as you care for God's building, everything, including salvation, holiness, victory, and spirituality, peace, and joy, will be yours
After working with the race of Adam God came in to have a new start by calling out Abraham to be the father of another race the called race
Jacob called the name of the place Bethel and even set up the stone that he had used for a pillow to become a pillar
Later, the temple was destroyed by the Babylonian army, and the children of Israel were held in captivity seventy years
When Peter, the leading apostle, was first brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone
Throughout the centuries, thousands of Christian books have been written, but most of them have missed the main street
In Deuteronomy 12:5 and 6, God seemed to be saying, 'You must not offer your burnt offerings and tithes at the place of your choice
Many famous Christian teachers have said that two or three gathering together in the name of the Lord Jesus are the church
They not only put away the foreign gods; they also changed their garments, that is, they put off the old man and put on the new man
Jacob made this thorough clearance, telling his people that they were going up to Bethel and that there they would make an altar unto God
In the church we have the altar, the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark of testimony
Tonight at the Lord's table meeting we declared to the whole universe that we are one and that we are Bethel, the house of God
When we make this declaration we have the full satisfaction the proof that the Lord is satisfied with Bethel with the building of His house
The book of Genesis covers the biographies of eight great persons: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph
Some may say that it is man's fall, God's redemption, our repentance, God's forgiveness, our regeneration, and our salvation
Justification is included in the Bible, but it is no more the subject of the Bible than a man's nose is the man himself
Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God and that God and the Lamb are the temple in it
He suffered many things in relation to his brother, his uncle, and his cousins, suffering twenty years under the hand of his uncle Laban
Genesis never says that as Jacob was undergoing those sufferings he purified himself or made a clearance of himself
In this dream God paid Jacob a gracious visitation and caused him, undoubtedly in the spirit, to speak concerning God's eternal economy
If Jacob had not been inspired by the Spirit of God, how could he, a supplanter, have spoken a word revealing God's eternal purpose?
At Bethel, Jacob prophesied in a wonderful way, speaking of God's house, but it seems that the prophecy returned to heaven
After his dream at Bethel, Jacob continued his supplanting, especially the supplanting of Laban, as if he had never had the dream
His only daughter became defiled, and his sons caused him trouble by slaughtering people and plundering their city
For the single purpose of going up to Bethel, Jacob and everyone with him had to make a thorough clearance and to purify themselves
You must rid yourself of all your foreign gods, purify yourself of every defilement, and change your garments'
Recently, an elderly Christian, a man who had been a preacher for over forty years, asked if we teach our people to dress in a certain way
According to both the Old Testament and the New Testament the first thing we must eliminate for the sake of Gods dwelling place is our idols
Your education, your ambition, your position, your name, your desire, and your intention may replace God in your life and thus become idols
On the day Jacob's people went up to Bethel, they purified themselves, and among them there were no foreign gods
Perhaps you have just repented, crying to the Lord; but when someone asks you how you are, you say that you are fine
Often, when it is time to go to the church meeting, something within begins to purify us, telling us to cleanse ourselves
Ephesians 4:22-24 reveals that the old manner of life was the life of the fallen humanity and that the new manner of life is of the church
Now, after having been saved and regenerated and having been brought into the church life, we must have a new manner of life
After putting away the foreign gods and purifying ourselves, we must change our garments, changing our manner of life
We should no longer express ourselves in an old way, but express ourselves as the church, as the new man in the new manner of life
Still less did He say, 'Jacob, you must tell your household and everyone with you to make a clearance and to purify themselves'
We must be cleansed in our whole being, inwardly and outwardly, from every pollution, and we must change our manner of life
Due to the trouble caused by his sons, Jacob was afraid that the city people would fight against him and kill him
At Bethel, he built an altar to God and 'called the place El-Beth-el' , realizing that God was God to him at Bethel
Verse 8 says, 'Deborah, Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth'
All the foreign gods, the self-beautifying items, and the nurses are buried under the flourishing life, especially the life in the church
In other words, in order to understand any point in Genesis, we need to trace its development elsewhere in the Scriptures
If you would go to heaven, you must pass through this dreadful place, for the house of God is the gate of heaven
As we saw in the last message, Jacob reacted to God's charge to arise and go up to Bethel by having a thorough clearance
Because the altar Jacob built in Bethel was built at the word of God, he had the boldness to call it 'El-Beth-el'
Many missionaries have gone to the mission field without having the assurance that their mission was 'El-mission'
Consecration made before coming into the church is one thing, and the consecration made within the church is another
Don't call yourself Jacob anymore, for that means that you live, walk, behave, and have your being in a 'Jacobean' way
Forget your feelings, considerations, understanding, and natural sight and listen to God's word and to His reminder
Some may say that this was only a promise given to Jacob and that none of the Old Testament promises are for us today
Stand on the Lord's word and say, 'Lord, what You promised Jacob was a shadow, but it must be a reality to me'
God also promised Jacob, saying, 'A company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins'
Literally speaking, this may be correct, but remember that everything in Jacob's life was a type to be fulfilled by us
Do you believe that the entire earth will be a great mountain and that there will be no plain, only a holy mountain?
The first thing that Jacob did in reacting to God's word was to repeat what he had done in Bethel the first time to set up a pillar of stone
In 28:18 Jacob set up for a pillar the stone he had used for a pillow and he called the name of that pillar Bethel
The basic offerings included the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
If we have the genuine experience of Christ day after day, this experience will fill us with joy as with divine wine
We shall understand that we must not only offer Christ to God as the basic offerings, but also as the drink offering
In the church life we all can experience Christ to the degree that we are willing to be poured out as a drink offering
In Genesis 28 Jacob called the place Bethel, but in Genesis 35, being convinced that it was Bethel, he again called that place by this name
Prior to chapter thirty-five, God was called the God of a certain person, for example, the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac
We all must experience God in such a way that He is not only God to us individually, but also the God of the house of God
He was the God of Abel, the God of Enosh, the God of Enoch, the God of Noah, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac
In the title El-Bethel this Hebrew word for God is used twice, at both the beginning and the ending of this title
We thank the Lord that after coming into the church life, we have had some experience of God's being God to us as a corporate body
Individually, we can experience the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac, but we cannot experience God as the God of Bethel
If many years ago you had been told about the God of the corporate body, it would have sounded like a foreign language to you
In the old, traditional way, when someone prayed, he not only finished one prayer but perhaps two or three other prayers at the same time
Elsewhere in this message we shall see the significance of God's telling Jacob that his name was no longer Jacob but Israel
Eventually, Jacob left Succoth and journeyed to Shechem in the land of Canaan, where he pitched his tent and erected an altar
They must proceed to chapter thirty-five and see that God is no longer merely the God of individuals, but the God of the house of God
Although it was good to build an altar in Shechem, this altar was not built at the house of God; it was not built in the church life
Following this, in 35:1, God could say, 'Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God'
The altar in Shechem was erected to the God of his individual experience; it was not an altar for the experience of God in a corporate way
After you get married, however, you find that your spouse is a troublemaker and that you need to consecrate yourself for this new situation
Many are afraid to come to Anaheim, thinking that it is too large and that the elders here are so strong and straight
As we all know, in front of the temple there was an altar, and no one could enter into the temple without first lingering at the altar
It seems that the church is the church, that you are you, and that you and the church have nothing to do with each other
If you can still be offended, it means that, although you may have an altar in Shechem, you do not have an altar in Bethel
In the past centuries, a number of books have been put out by Christian teachers on the subject of consecration
She even considers consecration to be a secret of the happy Christian life, but she says nothing for the church life
In nearly every revival in Christianity consecration is stressed, but one can hardly hear of the consecration for the house of God
We need the topmost consecration for the church life to fulfill God's eternal purpose and to satisfy His heart's desire
After coming to the church life and being in it for a time, we can testify that here God's appearing is not only real but also solid
Jacob was not given God's substantial blessing because he was not yet in the place where God intended him to be
In the church life, we need the highest consecration, the consecration for the house of God, not for individual enrichment
If we would see the purpose for God's being the all-sufficient One, we need to read Genesis 35 and compare it with Genesis 17
All Bible students agree that the first mention of an item in the Bible establishes a principle for that particular thing
Genesis 17:1, the first mention of the title the all-sufficient God, El-Shaddai, clearly reveals the significance of this title
Prior to that time, Abraham had been called by God for the purpose of becoming the father of so many of God's called ones
Whenever a called one of God uses his natural strength to do something for the accomplishment of God's purpose, God will be offended
Chapter seventeen speaks of the transformation of Abraham and chapter thirty-five speaks of the transformation of Jacob
Although God's promise in chapter twenty-eight speaks of dust, His promise in chapter thirty-five speaks of kings and nations
In the church life, our experience of the all-sufficient God is increasing day by day and even minute by minute
God changed Jacob's circumstances that he might be stirred up and receive the charge to arise and go up to Bethel
Their intention is not for the building up of the house of God; it is to build the little hut of their married life
The experience of many of us is this: when we were endeavoring to build a little hut for ourselves, God blew upon it
Do not think that all the church people are miserable because the hut of their married life has been demolished
Although there may be some similarity between this promise and gospel preaching the preaching of the gospel today is a form of fruitbearing
To be fruitful and to multiply means to bring forth children, to produce something out of the riches of your inner life
The 'monkey' multiplication is not the multiplication of God because a 'monkey' does not have the essence, the element, of God in it
If God had spoken this word before Abram had become Abraham, the natural man, not the transformed one, would have been multiplied
Only after Abraham had been circumcised and had experienced the changing of name did God promise to make him 'exceeding fruitful'
In their gospel preaching, many Christians have brought forth 'monkeys,' which are not good for the church life
In order to have this, we need to be transformed from Jacob into Israel because only Israel can bring forth Israel
You may say, 'Brother Lee, before you came into the church life, you were Jacob, and, thus, you brought forth other Jacobs'
Because in Christianity there is no kingdom, it is true to say that in Christianity there is not the proper church
The church life is a preparation for the kingdom, and in it we are now being disciplined to be Christ's co-kings
In 35:14, at Bethel Jacob eventually set up a pillar of stone as he did after having the dream when he was at Bethel the first time
If Jacob had not called this pillar the house of God, we would never realize that the pillar of stone was for the building of God's house
The first pillar was named Jachin, which means, 'He shall establish,' and the second was named Boaz, which means, 'In it is strength'
According to our natural concept, we would think that Solomon should firstly have built the pillars and then the temple
It was after he had built the temple that he proceeded to build two pillars and to place them in front of the temple
If we could have seen that temple, our eyes would have firstly attended, not to the temple itself, but to these two pillars
We have pointed out that the name Jachin means, 'He shall establish' and that the name Boaz means, 'In it is strength'
Jacob however not only interpreted his dream verbally saying This is the house of God he also set up a pillar and called it the house of God
How could Jacob, an unrepentant, unregenerated, and untransformed supplanter, have done such a wonderful thing?
He did it, and we all must say, 'Thank you, Jacob, for opening the heavens that we might see the house of God'
When you enter into the temple of God in the universe, the first thing you see is this God-man, this Israel standing before God's building
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'I am Christ, the rock, and you are a stone to be built upon Me for the building up of My church'
In his first Epistle, Peter later said, 'You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house'
Formerly, he was an opposer of God's building, doing everything possible to persecute, damage, and lay it waste
Many Christians realize that Peter and John were disciples and apostles, but not many realize that they were also pillars
In chapter twenty-eight, we have the pillar of stone, and in 1 Kings 7 we have the two pillars in front of the temple
In Galatians 2:9 pillars are mentioned again, this time with respect to the temple of God in the New Testament
The entire city, which is twelve thousand stadia in length, breadth, and height, will be an enlarged Holy of Holies
In the Old Testament, two pillars indicated the temple of God, and in the New Testament, three pillars declared God's building
They accuse us of being too much for the church and of not caring for gospel preaching, Bible teaching, or other types of Christian work
If you read your New Testament, you will see that the pillars Peter, James, John, as well as Paul were 'crazy' for God's building
The place of Lots wife is the right position to become a pillar of shame and Bethel is the proper place to become a pillar for the building
When some Christians hear this, they will say, 'Brother Lee, do you mean that only those in the church can become pillars of stone?
It is significant that, in chapters twenty-eight and thirty-five, Jacob set up a pillar in Bethel, in the house of God
In the practicality of Bethel in chapter thirty-five, Jacob not only set up a pillar, but poured a drink offering upon it
If you live for Christ, it is you who do things for Him, but you remain yourself and Christ is not wrought into your being
The reason for this is that outside the church, in the so-called Christian religion, very few are taught to have Christ wrought into them
They told me, both in plain words and by suggestions, that the people in Dallas were not ready to hear about the church
After we experience Christ in a subjective way and are definitely and absolutely in the church life we still need a great deal of perfection
After the Lord had spent three and a half years working on him, he was perfected and, on the day of Pentecost, he was set up as a pillar
If you read the book of Acts, you will see that Peter was a pillar standing in front of the New Testament temple of God
Peter was in the Gospels, in the beginning of the New Testament, but we are at the end of the New Testament, even in Revelation 3:12
Drop your opinions, love the Lord, take Him as your life and as your person, and live by Him in the church life
We must submit to the hands of the gifted persons, just as the brass was subject to the skilled and gifted hands of Hiram
After Jacob had arranged a settlement with Laban, he 'took a stone, and set it up for a pillar' , and this pillar was a testimony
That the two pillars were made of brass clearly indicates that if we would be a pillar we must realize that we are those under Gods judgment
Many of us in mainland China said, 'Don't think that you can be an elder and do not be ambitious to be an elder
After realizing that the eldership in a particular locality had been filled up they moved to another locality where there were many openings
Whenever you say this, you are finished, and the Lord would never put His seal upon this evaluation of yourself
The more responsibility you bear in the proper church life, the more you must realize that you are under God's judgment
If we would be pillars, we must firstly judge ourselves and then be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God
Just as the two boards standing together made three complete cubits, so the two pillars make three complete units'
The purpose of this is to impress us with the completion and perfection of our being mingled with God in His eternal administration
The number seven, which signifies perfection and completion in God's move in this age, is composed of four plus three
The pillars are not square, rectangular, or triangular; they are round, circular, signifying that their perfection is eternal
As we have pointed out, even after we have become the number twelve, we are still only eighteen cubits in height
If you pray over these points, you will see that this is the pillar that can bear the responsibility in the house of God
We have seen that the number five the height of the capitals denotes responsibility and that two times five means fullness of responsibility
The more we try to explain ourselves, the more misunderstanding there will be, and this misunderstanding will multiply
The church life is a checkerwork surrounded by a chain, and the eldership is a most intricate trellis with the strongest chain
Every situation faced by the church members is a checkerwork, a trellis encircled by a crown of pins and thorns
We must not only bear the responsibility in this intermixed and complicated situation, but also live in the midst of it
If you sisters are mothers in the church life, you must say, 'I am not a mother in the church by myself, but by Him'
What earthly architect would have designed a brass pillar bearing brass capitals with lily work on the top of them?
Every elder expects the church life to be clear-cut like a Chinese bean cake where every piece is cut square and neat
All the complaints, dissatisfactions, and troubling telephone calls eventually form a projection full of pomegranates
These two pillars standing on the porch testify that the Lord will establish His building and that genuine strength is in the building
We have seen that when Jacob was first at Bethel, he set up as a pillar the stone he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God
Today's Christians have very little concern for God's building, which is for the accomplishment of God's economy
If we would know the building according to the biblical way we must firstly see the pillar for the pillar is a signboard of Gods building
Because, at this end time, God is completing His building, we must carefully consider what the pillar is and how we can become a pillar
Praise the Lord that many of us can testify that day by day we are the brass growing lilies and expressing pomegranates
Praise the Lord for these two negative things, because the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates can only be connected by them
Without the network and the chainwork, our co-crucifixion with Christ and His living instead of us would be mere doctrine
We may know the doctrine of being crucified with Christ and recite Galatians 2:20 over and over only to discover that this does not avail
It has been through these two negative things that the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ have been practically applied to my life
In addition to all the points covered in the previous message, we must cover nine further points in this message
Around the capitals were 'chains like a necklace,' or 'chains at the collar,' that divided the capital into two sections
Although 1 Kings 7:16 says that the capitals were five cubits high, 2 Kings 25:17 says that the capitals were three cubits high
The reason for this is that three cubits is the height of the base of the capital and five cubits is the height of the whole capital
The network covers the bowls the chainwork surrounds the bowls the pomegranates are upon the chainwork and the lily grows upon the network
All those who serve in the business office are on the way of the three days, that is, they are in the process of resurrection
We must be strong, not simply in declaring that we are the testimony of Jesus, but in having a testimony by living
The more thorns there are, the better, because the thorns give the opportunity for the Lord's ability to be expressed
Since every row had one hundred pomegranates, why did Jeremiah 52:23 suddenly speak of ninety-six pomegranates?
The Hebrew word translated 'side' in the King James Version is ruach, the word for spirit, wind, breath, and air
Whenever the number four disappears, we shall have the ninety-six pomegranates, the rich expression of the life of Christ in the open air
Each pillar was a cylinder whose walls were four fingers thick, and within each pillar was a large hollow space
Although it is easy for two brothers to stand side by side, it is difficult for one brother to be under the other
Kings 7:15 says that each pillar was eighteen cubits high, but 2 Chronicles 3:15 indicates that the two pillars were thirty-five cubits long
If you consider your experience, you will see that there is no sacrifice required to be side by side with others
All the crossing, breaking, and suppressing are temporary, yet they are complete, for they are in the number seven
That the pillars are twelve cubits in circumference and capitals four cubits in diameter implies the presence of the number three
In this message, a parenthesis in our study of the pillars, we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars
We need to know the constitution of those who are builders, not of the building generally, but of the pillars specifically
Nonetheless, it is certain that it refers to people from Dan, for the city of Dan was also of the people of the tribe of Dan
Once we are in the tribe of 'Naphtali,' we are no longer the same as our 'Danite' mother and our 'Tyrian' father
Genesis 4917 says Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
Jeroboam, the king of the northern tribes, set up golden calves in Bethel and in Dan to cause the children of God to stumble
Due to this, in 1 Chronicles 2 through 9, where all the other tribes of Israel are mentioned in detail, there is no mention of Dan
These details concerning Dan indicate that to be a mother who is 'a woman of the daughters of Dan' is to be a mother in sin
Although his mother was a Danite and his father a Tyrian, Hiram eventually became one belonging to the tribe of Naphtali
We must not understand the Bible according to our natural mind; we must understand the Bible according to the Bible
If you do not know how to exercise faith in God when you are in a desperate situation, at that time you will creep in the valleys
At that time, law was the highest science among the Jews, and whoever became a doctor of law was considered to be most outstanding
Acts 7:22 says, 'Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds'
The royal Egyptian family was Moses' 'Tyrian' father, for it was there that he learned all the wisdom of Egypt
The source of our secular or religious skill must die, but that the source of our human being must still exist
After gaining it, he thought that he was qualified to deliver his people out of the hands of the Egyptians , but he failed in this endeavor
In his Psalm, Psalm 90, Moses said that people may expect to live to be seventy, and that the stronger ones may live to be eighty
When you were forty years of age, you had a great deal of fuel, but now you are old, dried up, and have no more fuel
Later, as Moses led the children of Israel in the wilderness, what he had learned in the royal palace became useful
Because no one else had all the wisdom of the Egyptians, no one else could have done the work he did in the wilderness
Whatever he has learned in the past will become useful in resurrection, and he will be able to deliver a word as few others are able to do
If our Tyrian father still lives and we remain in the natural life the Tyrian skill will be of no avail to the building up of Gods temple
Rather, study more diligently than the secular students, get the highest grades, and go on for advanced degrees
Young people, gain all the up-to-date knowledge, graduate from college, and then say goodbye to your 'Tyrian' father
After you gain your Tyrian education you must put your Tyrian father in a coffin and bury him so that your Danite mother becomes a widow
Didn't he write a gospel containing twenty-one chapters and the book of Revelation containing twenty-two chapters'?
John could say, 'In the beginning was the Word,' 'In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,' and 'Behold, the Lamb of God'
John could tell people that if they believed in Him, they would have life, but that if they did not believe in Him, they would die
If you expend your energy in this way, by the time you are thirty you will be able to begin your ministry like the Lord Jesus did
If you are, then you must be related to your 'Tyrian' father, learn the 'Tyrian' skill and trade, and gain the wisdom of the 'Egyptians'
We would acquire all the wisdom of the 'Egyptians,' but we would not work for the 'Egyptians' we would work for the holy tabernacle
Sometimes when translators have difficulty with a particular passage, they assume that the manuscripts are in error
Often what at first glance appears to be a mistake in the manuscripts turns out to be a mysterious truth hidden in the Scriptures
According to this rendering and the understanding of most translators, the modifier, 'of the tribe of Naphtali,' goes with the word 'widow'
Some translators, neglecting the Hebrew text of 1 Kings 7:14, tried their best to reconcile this discrepancy, but they failed
In this record of Hiram, the pillar builder, we have three peoples: the people of Dan, the people of Tyre, and the people of Naphtali
We do not know how a man whose mother was of Dan and whose father was of Tyre could be of the tribe of Naphtali
Although there seems to be no reason for Hiram to be of the tribe of Naphtali, the Bible clearly tells that he was of this tribe
Dan was a people of the serpent that bit the horse in the race of God , and Tyre, a center filled with commerce, was related to Satan
The hind signifies a person who trusts in God, who walks upon the mountaintops, and who lives by the resurrected Christ for God's building
Many who do not know the significance of the tribe of Dan or of the country of Tyre would say, 'Dan is Dan and Tyre is Tyre
Now we must ask how a man born of a Danite mother and a Tyrian father could become one of the tribe of Naphtali
If that had been the case, this record would not match our experience, and it would be impossible to allegorize this portion of the Word
At the age of forty, he considered himself qualified to deliver his people from the usurping hand of the Egyptians
Your continued existence is the 'mother,' and the source of your skill, which has been cut off, is your deceased 'father'
Now you possess the skill without the source, and your human existence is no longer tied to your worldly origin
Many of the young brothers and sisters are unbalanced and say We are in the Lords recovery and we are expecting the Lord to come back soon
Such a person, four years behind in school, might be retarded and would be unable to understand my fellowship concerning the Bible
Although you should do your best to earn an advanced degree, after you have earned it, you must be prepared to sever the worldly ties
After you have labored for years to earn your degree, you must put your 'Tyrian' father in a coffin and bury him
Although some boast of their education, after we have earned our degrees, we must bury Cambridge, Oxford, and every other university
The best Christians are those who study diligently and who afterwards seem to forget that they have earned a degree
To them, it is mysterious that we would devote so much time and labor to earn a degree and then not respect it
Although we believe that the Lord is coming soon, we should still expect to have a long life on the earth for the Lord's use
That the 'Tyrian' father must die and our mother must keep on living means that we should ask the Lord to give us a long life
If we had two strong pillars to go to one of the new places, within a few months three other localities would open up
Use this opportunity to learn, to be trained, to be adjusted, to be saturated by the Lord, and to be made useful for Him
According to the old way, many go to the meetings clinging to their opinions and thinking that they are so experienced
When the brothers minister the Word, they 'discern' the message , wanting to determine whether or not the brothers are scriptural
After your 'Tyrian' father has died and your 'Danite' mother has become widowed, you must not remain a natural person
The transferred Naphtalite must be fetched out of Tyre and come to King Solomon in Jerusalem where God's building is
Although you may be very useful, if you remain in Tyre, you will be useless as far as God's building is concerned
Moses did not actually bring the children of Israel into the rest; Joshua, who was a pillar built up by Moses, did this
Paul had learned a great deal at the feet of Gamaliel , but Gamaliel, the source of Paul's skill, had to be cut off
Undoubtedly, this change of name indicated that the Lord's intention was to transform him into a stone for God's building
Although many Christians devote a great deal of attention to regeneration, very few pay attention to transformation
As a result, we were regenerated and received the divine life, which was sown into the depths of our being as the seed of transformation
If we read Revelation 21 carefully, we shall see that the New Jerusalem will be the enlargement of the temple of God
Today, the temple of God is a house, but in eternity the temple of God will be a city, which of course is much greater than a house
Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us, and Romans 8:10 says that Christ is in us
According to the Bible, we definitely believe that Christ was resurrected physically with a body of flesh and bones
Listen to this: On the day of resurrection the resurrected Christ, having a body of flesh and bones, came into a locked room
Although Christ was resurrected with a body of flesh and bones, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection
In most situations today, if one brother rebuked another, the brother who received the rebuke would not forgive the brother who rebuked him
By reading the New Testament we clearly see that Peter was transformed into Cephas, one of the pillars of the church
Truth is not vain doctrine; it is the expression of reality, doctrine constituted with reality and conveying that reality
To some of our critics, the continuation of the manifestation of God in the church is a form of evolution into God
If as the church we hold this testimony, we shall be able to say that we are the continuation of the mystery of godliness
We admit that we are still flesh, but the very God who lives in our spirit will be manifested, expressed, in our flesh
In the church we should not think of some as older ones and of others as younger, for we all are being transformed
After hearing the messages on Hiram, the builder of the pillars, many young people have been motivated to further their education
The basic element in being a pillar is neither your education nor capability, but your Christ, the very Christ added into your being
In Revelation 3:8 the Lord Jesus said, 'You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name'
If we do this, we shall be overcomers, and the Lord will write upon us the name of His God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name
If we would keep the Lord's word, we must firstly drop our opinions and then have the Lord Jesus added into our being
If we do not deny the name of the Lord, then we have His Person as ours, and His Person becomes our designation
When you go to work, perhaps in a large corporation with hundreds of employees, there is no need for you to label yourself as a Christian
Having money and other valuables that had to be left behind, they looked for someone to whom they could entrust their possessions
To keep the Lord's word is not merely a doctrinal matter, and to confess His name is not simply to utter a few statements
The Lord also held to this position in the four Gospels, always standing on the ground of One who had been sent by God
It means that the New Jerusalem is a building, not according to any man's will, but according to the will of God
Only those who are like this are qualified to be labeled with the name of the city of Christ's God, the New Jerusalem
When you experience Christ in a certain way, that aspect of Christ will become your designation, the new name written upon you
To serve the Lord full-time required an extreme exercise of my faith, and nothing in my environment favored this decision
Recently, one brother declared strongly that he only knows to follow the ministry of Brother Lee and to absorb everything of this ministry
According to God's principle in His creation, in order for anything to grow there is the need for a negative side
We all appreciate chicken eggs, breasts, and legs, but we certainly do not care for chicken dung, feathers, and bones
Without these 'feathers,' 'bones,' and 'dung,' neither the church in Los Angeles nor my ministry would be able to exist
If you do this, you will not damage the church in Los Angeles or my ministry, but you will surely damage yourself
Let us follow the example of such brothers to forget the negative things and to feast upon the 'eggs,' 'breasts,' and 'legs'
There was one flow with Abel, Noah, and Abraham, and at the end of the Old Testament there was still only one flow
Because the Lord is still living, moving, and working on earth, there must also be just one flow on earth today
He built an altar, set up a pillar, poured a drink offering upon the pillar, and then poured oil upon the pillar
In this message we shall consider Jacob's pouring the drink offering and the oil upon the pillar he had set up
Remember that nearly every item mentioned in the book of Genesis is the seed of a truth developed in the following books of the Bible
Twenty years later, after he had been touched by the Lord and had been somewhat transformed, he returned to Bethel
Without experience, you will not be able to have this offering because the drink offering is composed of our experience of Christ
Daily we should experience Him as our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering
He will realize that he should be absolutely for God; however, he will find that he is not able to be absolute
He will enjoy Christ as his meal offering, as the One who not only satisfies God, but who also feeds and supplies him
He will daily take Christ as his food and Christ will nourish him and support him to live in the presence of God that God might be satisfied
The Lord spoke this word in His answer to some disciples of John the Baptist who asked Him why His disciples did not fast
The new cloth is Christ as our new, unique, complete, and perfect righteousness for us to be justified before God
When he saw how 'crazy' we were, he gave us a supplementary message telling us that we all need to be 'crazy,' beside ourselves
Have you ever been in a state where you were so happy that you were not able to control yourself, even beside yourself with joy?
Not only the young people, but even the older brothers and sisters should be 'crazy' in their inner chamber with the Lord
We need to experience Him as our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering
When we become drunk of Christ and with Christ, we become wine to satisfy God, and we are qualified and ready to be a drink offering
The drink offering is not merely Christ Himself; it is the Christ who saturates us until Christ and we, we and Christ, become one
The drink offering is mentioned in Leviticus 231013 verses related to bringing the firstfruits of the harvest of the good land to the priest
Along with this sheaf of firstfruits, the children of Israel had to offer a burnt offering with a meal offering and a drink offering
Although the wine in Matthew 9:17 was only Christ, Paul said, 'I am already being poured out as a drink offering'
Because they cannot be a drink offering, this gathering of Christians cannot be considered as the house of God
The only pillar that can be rightly called the house of God is the pillar upon which the drink offering has been poured
If we do not have the drink offering poured out upon the pillar, it is questionable that we have the genuine building
The drink offering does not come from wine out of the winepress; it comes from our experience of drinking the wine
It touches us very deeply to see a person who is so saturated with Christ that his only interest is Christ and the church
In verses 38 through 42 we are told that the priests had to offer the daily continual burnt offering with the drink offering
When the days of a Nazarite's separation were fulfilled, he had to offer a burnt offering, a sin offering, and a peace offering
The Nazarite was qualified to offer the drink offering because he was one who had experienced God to a great degree
The Christ whom we experience in this subjective way is the wine we pour out to satisfy God for God's building
His writings reveal that he was 'crazy' for the church; he was drunk with Christ and interested only in God's house, God's temple
The basic offering, which is Christ Himself, must always be complemented by a matching offering, the drink offering
The matching offering is not merely Christ Himself; it is the Christ who has saturated us and who has made us one with Him
The more the basic offerings make us one with Christ, the more we become the matching offering, the drink offering
The drink offering is first mentioned in relation to God's building, for this offering was poured out upon the pillar
From the first mention to the last, the drink offering is mainly for God's building, not mainly for the worship of God
Apparently the drink offering is for worship actually it is for the house of God for the building of the pillar the signboard of Gods temple
When you are filled to the brim with the experience of Christ then you will be ready to be poured out to be martyred for the building of God
If we are ready to be poured out as a drink offering, we are also ready to experience the outpouring of the Spirit
The pouring out of the oil caused the building of God to be absolutely holy, sanctified, and separated unto God
Jacob's leaving Bethel does not mean that he left the house of God; it means that he was going on in his spiritual experience
Although Jacob had four wives, only Rachel was the natural and original choice according to the desire of Jacob's heart
If you read Genesis carefully, you will see that Jacob's heart was absolutely set on Rachel; he had no heart for the other three
He put the two handmaids and their children at the front, followed by Leah and her children in the middle, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear
The fact that Jacob placed Rachel and Joseph at the rear to protect them in case of attack reveals that Jacob's heart was set on Rachel
As Rachel was giving birth to her second child, she died, and Jacob's natural choice, the desire of his heart, was taken away from him
Before the experience at Bethel, God tolerated Jacob's natural choice, allowing him to have his heart's desire
Many of us can testify that before we experienced the church life, we still had our natural concept, natural choice, and natural desire
When Joseph was born, Jacob was very happy and might have said, 'This is God's blessing upon the desire of my heart
After you have had some experience at Bethel, you will lose your natural choice, but you will gain Benjamin, who is a type of Christ
Verse 18 says, 'And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin'
In this whole universe there is only One who is both the Son of sorrow and the Son of the right hand and that One is Christ
After thirty-three and a half years, in resurrection and ascension Christ became the Son of the right hand of God
Through the church life 'Rachel' will have a marvelous and encouraging delivery, dying that the wonderful Christ may come forth
Although Rachel named her second son Benoni, a name of sorrow, Jacob immediately changed the name to Benjamin, a name of encouragement
The fact that Jacob changed the name of his son proves that he was not disappointed or discouraged by the loss of Rachel
If this had taken place before Jacobs experience at Bethel he would have said Amen his name must be Benoni because he is a son of sorrow
Verse 21 indicates that Jacob had truly been transformed: 'And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar'
Prior to this, his name had been changed from Jacob to Israel , but he had never actually been called by his new name
When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was accompanied by two thieves, one of whom was saved and one of whom was lost
He was lifted up to the throne at the right hand of Pharaoh and was empowered to administer the life supply to all the people
As we have pointed out, in typology Joseph is the continuation of Benjamin, the son of sorrow who became the son of the right hand
When he came to the home of his uncle Laban in Padan-aram, the first person he met was Rachel , and she immediately became his choice
God was sovereign in causing Jacob to meet Rachel first, and He was also sovereign in allowing Laban to play a trick on Jacob
Although none of us would have been this patient, Jacob patiently waited out this time, and eventually Rachel was given to him
On the one hand, Jacob was frustrated from having his natural choice; on the other hand, he was permitted to have it
Although God has ordained something for us, He will not allow us to have it according to our way and according to our time
Sooner or later, we shall journey on, and at His time His hand will take away our desire, our choice, that Benjamin may come forth
The book of Genesis issues in Joseph on the throne with power and authority to administer the life supply to all people
Whatever our choice is whether it is related to marriage, eating, or manner of dress it will be given in the Lord's way and in His time
Of being disappointed he was greatly encouraged immediately changing his sons name from the son of sorrow to the son of the right hand
Prior to chapter thirty-five, Jacob had passed through many dealings, especially during his twenty years with Laban
Due to the fact that he defiled Jacob's concubine, he lost his birthright, and the birthright was given to Joseph
After the relationship between Jacob and Rachel had been fully dealt with, one of their sons was given the birthright
Having forced Jacob to marry Leah and to bring forth the firstborn through her, He eventually loosed His hand and let Reuben go
You may be concerned about God's dealing so thoroughly with your natural choice, with the desire of your heart
By the loss of Rachel Jacob gained a second son who typified Christ, and by the defilement caused by Reuben the birthright was adjusted
The defilement of Jacob's concubine by Reuben was shameful, but even such a shameful thing was used to bring a positive result
After experiencing these deeper and more personal dealings, Jacob entered into full fellowship with the Lord at Hebron
Many who are in the church life today are not in a spiritual situation that is intimate, peaceful, satisfying, and joyful
Verse 27 says, 'And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto Kiriath-arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned'
Abraham had come to Shechem , had passed through Bethel , and had dwelt in Hebron , and Isaac spent nearly his whole life in Hebron
Jacob, therefore, followed Abraham's footsteps to come to Shechem , to pass through Bethel , and to dwell in Hebron
After Jacob came to Hebron and entered into full rest, God took away his father and set him completely free from every earthly tie
Although Jacob set up pillars four times, he erected them in just three places at Gilead, at Bethel, and on the way to Bethlehem
In this message we must consider, as a parenthesis, the significance of the three pillars and the one tower in Jacob's life
If Jacob had been under his own care he would not have been able to deal with his cunning uncle Laban or to confront his strong brother Esau
Although Jacob did everything possible to take care of himself, he gradually learned that he was under God's care
He did not leave in a glorious way; rather he was afraid of Laban and stole away from him in a somewhat shameful manner
Although Laban did not know of Jacob's flight until three days later, he still pursued him until he caught up with him
The night before Laban overtook Jacob, God said to him, 'Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad'
Although he was in Laban's squeezing hand for such a long time , God was with him all the while, and His hand was upon him
At the end of this stage of his experience he set up a pillar at Gilead as a landmark to testify of God's care
As we shall see in our Christian life we need three pillars three landmarks the first of which is the pillar testifying of Gods care for us
After the serious trouble following the defilement of Jacob's daughter, Dinah, God came in and told Jacob to arise and to go up to Bethel
At Bethel Jacob consecrated himself to God so that He might fulfill His purpose of having Bethel, the house of God
Today our testimony is not that of the first pillar, the testimony of God's care; it is the second pillar, the testimony of God's house
Most are primarily concerned about their own needs, and the pillar they set up is only a testimony of God's care
In our Christian life we have not only the first section, the section of God's care, but also the second section, the section of God's house
Not only did he answer God's call; he also consecrated himself to God for the fulfillment of His desire to have Bethel
As Jacob was journeying on, he had an experience that was a matter of both joy and suffering, a matter of both gain and loss
In order to gain the son, you must sacrifice your wife, and in order to keep your wife, you must be denied the son
Genesis 35:20 says that Jacob set a pillar upon Rachel's grave, and that this 'is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day'
Rachel was the first person Jacob met when he arrived at Laban's home, and he immediately fell in love with her
All of Leah's six deliveries of her sons and the one of her daughter went very well, but Rachel died in giving birth to her second child
Benjamin's birth not only took Rachel's life, but also the life of his descendants more than seventeen hundred years later
Because Christ had been born in Bethlehem, Herod slew all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and younger
Rachel not only suffered at the time of her delivery; she even suffered more than seventeen hundred years later
Jacob had set up a pillar at Gilead and a pillar at Bethel, but now he had to set up the third pillar on the way to Bethlehem
In our Christian life we also must have the landmark of the third pillar at Rachel's grave, the place where our natural choice is buried
He had set up the first pillar at Gilead and the second at Bethel; now he had to set up the third pillar upon Rachel's grave
The bringing forth of Christ and the expression of Christ cost us our natural life, our natural love, and our natural choice
Our Christian life must have three sections the section of Gods care the section of Gods house and the section of the expression of Christ
Even more than seventeen hundred years later, many of her descendants were martyred that Christ might be brought forth
No matter how much martyrdom and weeping there will be, there will also be a wonderful birth the birth of Benjamin and the birth of Christ
At the tower of Eder something defiling, shameful, and immoral happened to Jacob: his son Reuben committed adultery with Jacob's concubine
The fact that Reuben committed adultery with Jacob's concubine at that place was an indication that Jacob should not have stayed there
Although Jacob set up three pillars, there was no need for him to build the tower of Eder because it was already standing there as a snare
While Jacob was enjoying the ease of life at the tower of Eder, Reuben committed adultery with his father's concubine
Because Joseph kept himself pure, he gained the birthright Reuben had lost due to his defilement at the tower of Eder
In this message we come to the most pleasant section of the book of Genesis, chapters thirty-seven through fifty
The record of the first thirty-six chapters is brief and emphatic, but the record of the last fourteen chapters is very detailed
Genesis begins with the words, 'In the beginning God created,' and it ends with the words, 'He was put in a coffin in Egypt'
Although with Noah we do see a little of God's expression and dominion, it is rather vague; it is not definite, impressive, or clear
Although many Christians have overly exalted Abraham, he was only on the first level of the doctrine of Christ
Although he did not weep at the death of Rachel, he wept sorrowfully when he concluded that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast
The last fourteen chapters of Genesis indicate that after Jacob had become Israel he bore the image of God and exercised the dominion of God
There is no retirement in the spiritual life, and God intervened to upset what appeared to be Jacob's retirement
The mention of the coat of many colors is a little window through which we can see Jacobs character desire intention goal and disposition
To be transformed is to be changed in our natural life, whereas to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us
Rather, he was fully matured, he was filled with the divine life, and he had the expression of God and the dominion of God
The other ten brothers were dirty and evil, and Joseph constantly brought to his father evil reports about them
Levi and Simeon were cruel, having avenged the defilement of their sister, Dinah, by slaying Hamor and Shechem and plundering their city
As we have seen, 'Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors'
Joseph's brothers also hated him because he was good and because he gave evil reports about them to their father
In our eyes Joseph's brothers, being adulterers, fornicators, murderers, and haters, should have been condemned to hell
God was sovereign in giving Joseph these dreams for they reveal the nature the position the function and the goal of Gods people on earth
In the first dream the sheaves bowed down to Joseph's sheaf, and in the second, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to him
When Joseph told his father and brothers about his second dream, Jacob rebuked him and said, 'What is this dream that thou has dreamed?
Joseph on the contrary was genuine, frank, open, and transparent; he was happy to tell his brothers about his dreams
When Joseph's brothers 'saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him'
In Reuben's absence Judah, the fourth brother, proposed that instead of slaying Joseph, they sell him to the Ishmaelites
Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh'
Through God's sovereignty, which was exercised in all these seemingly coincidental matters, Jacob lost the treasure of his heart
When Jacob heard this news, he 'rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days'
Although his children tried to comfort him, he refused to be comforted and said, 'I will go down into Sheol unto my son mourning'
Praise the Lord that we not only have chapter thirty-seven, but also chapter forty-seven, where we see a glorious result
Jacob had to walk this narrow underpass and experience a suffering that touched his heart profoundly that he might mature
Before we consider further Jacob's dealings at Hebron, we need to point out the difference between transformation and maturity
As we read from chapter twenty-six to thirty-six, which covers a period of approximately twenty-five years, we see how Jacob changed
When in chapter thirty-seven Jacob lost his beloved son, Joseph, he was absolutely different from the person he was in chapter twenty-seven
In a spiritual sense, the Jacob in chapter twenty-seven had several hands to use in grasping whatever he wanted
In chapter twenty-seven we see a supplanter; in chapter thirty-seven, a transformed man; and in chapter forty-seven, a mature person
It is difficult to put something in us living vessels because we are filled with opinions, desires, and intentions
During all these years, Jacob was a jar open to the heavens, and the heavenly rain was continuously falling into him
We have seen that in the twenty years between the loss of Joseph and the coming of this famine, Jacob had nothing to do
In ancient times it was a long journey from Hebron to Egypt; it took about eight to ten days to travel this distance
After the ten sons had left for Egypt, only the youngest, Benjamin, who was in his early twenties, remained with Jacob
When they returned home and discovered 'every man's bundle of money was in his sack,' they all, including Jacob, were afraid
At this point Judah reminded Jacob that in order to buy food again in Egypt, they had to take Benjamin with them
Due to the severity of the famine, Jacob was forced to send his youngest son with his brothers to Egypt to buy grain
Joseph had been taken away, Simeon had been detained in Egypt, and now all the others had also gone down to Egypt
Although this was a great suffering to Jacob, the main point here is not his suffering it is the fact that he was being emptied out by God
As we shall see, on the day Jacob received the good news about Joseph, he was completely filled with the fullness of life
As Joseph and his brothers were happy together in Egypt, Jacob was suffering in Canaan, waiting for his sons to return
When the news came regarding Joseph, Jacob had not only been transformed; he was completely filled with the divine life
In order to be transformed, Jacob had to be pressed into situations that gave him no choice except to undergo a change
If we read the book of Genesis again and again, we shall see that the two main aspects of Jacob's experience are transformation and maturity
Because there is such a lack of transformation and maturity among Gods people we have not yet seen the accomplishment of His eternal purpose
For God's economy we do not merely need the overcoming of sin; we also need the transformation of our being and the fullness of His life
If you could have asked an Egyptian who was reigning over him, he would have said that a Hebrew, an Israelite, was reigning
From Jacob's experience we see that everything that happens to us is under God's sovereignty for our transformation and maturity
He had also learned that this merciful God is all-sufficient, not only almighty, to meet his needs in every kind of situation
Now his trust and rest are altogether in the mercy of his all-sufficient God, no longer in himself and in his ability
Although in chapters twenty-five to thirty-two there is no transformation, no change in life, these chapters are full of dealings
After those twenty years of dealings one night at Peniel the Lord came and touched Jacobs strongest part his thigh and Jacob became lame
That marked the beginning of Jacobs transformation and the process of transformation continued from chapter thirtytwo to chapter thirtyseven
There are three distinct periods in Jacob's life: the period of dealings, the period of transformation, and the period of maturity
If you compare three chapters, twenty-seven, thirty-seven, and forty-seven, you will see the dealings, the transformation, and the maturity
The first sign of Jacob's maturity is the fact that he did not blame his sons when he heard the news about Joseph's being alive in Egypt
Although they had conspired to kill Joseph, eventually sold him into slavery, and lied to their father about him, Jacob did not blame them
Verse 26 says that 'Jacob's heart became numb' , and verse 27 says that 'the spirit of Jacob their father revived'
We were very happy to see the excitement of our grandsons, for it was an indication that they are living and healthy
Some may think that verse 26 indicates that Jacob's heart was shocked at the good news and that it became numb because of the shock
When we grow into a certain degree of life, spontaneously we shall have the manifestation of life related to that degree of life
Another sign of Jacob's maturity was that he displayed no excitement showing looseness of self at seeing Joseph
Some young saints, thinking that the elders are not humble or diligent enough, pray for them in a childish way
From his experience through the years, he had come to know that his destiny was in the hands of God, not in his own hands
As Jacob was about to bless the two sons of Joseph, he spoke of God as the One who had shepherded him all his life long
Joseph presented his sons to Jacob, placing Manasseh, the firstborn, at Jacob's right hand and Ephraim at Jacob's left hand
Joseph expected that Jacob would place his right hand upon Manasseh's head and his left hand upon Ephraim's head
Being very clear inwardly about what he was doing, Jacob crossed his hands and placed his right hand upon Ephraim's head
Joseph was not happy with this and he said, 'Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head'
Jacob blessed his twelve sons, and those blessings were prophecies relating to the destiny of the twelve tribes of Israel
The great ones in the Old Testament could say that Christ was coming, and John the Baptist could say that Christ was in front of him
If by having more of Christ we are greater than others, then we are qualified to bless them; for the greater always blesses the lesser
If Christ had never been incarnated, God would not have been able to flow to man, because there would not have been a channel
A child two years of age cannot bless anyone; however, a child of seven or eight may perform some kind of blessing
Melchisedec came as the eternal priest, and Christ became a priest according to the eternal order of Melchisedec
A priest eliminates the distance between God and the people; he brings those who are far off into the presence of God
We all realize that a priest serves God, but we may never have seen that he also eliminates the distance between the people and God
After he blesses you, this distance is taken away, and you are brought into the presence of God to share in the enjoyment of God
The second aspect of the threefold blessing is related to God the Son who stooped in kindness to visit us that we may have grace
He gives peace not only in our environment, but also in our being in our heart, in our spirit, and even in our mind
In summary we may say that blessing is the bringing of people into the presence of God, into the very enjoyment of God
In the Old Testament the basic thought with respect to blessing is that of bringing people into God's presence
In the New Testament the Apostle, coming with God, not only brought people into the presence of God; he also brought God into them
Because parents have their natural taste, natural choice, and natural concept, they are always maneuvering the situation
In our families, in the preaching of the gospel, and in the church service, we must learn to keep our hands off
Apart from Peter, James, and John, nothing is mentioned about the other Apostles in the book of Acts after the first chapter
Most of the time our choosing leads to maneuvering, and God's crossing hand comes in to bless the one we did not choose
Those who are parents and those who are leading ones in the church service must be careful about their choosing
Do not exercise any kind of maneuvering according to your likes and dislikes, for God's blessing always crosses our maneuvering
Among many churches, especially the large churches, there has been an atmosphere that made people feel they are not needed
Paul called Timothy his 'child in faith' and Titus his 'genuine child according to the common faith' , and Peter spoke of 'Mark my son'
We need the growth in life and the maturity in life so that we may be filled with Christ to become those who are able to bless others
In this message, a parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider another one of these seeds the seed of the shifting of the birthright
In nearly every race of people, especially in ancient times, the firstborn in a family inherited a special portion
According to the Bible as a whole, the birthright includes the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood
The Lord likened the Pharisees to the second son who said that he would fulfill his father's word, but who actually did not obey it
The shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob reveals that receiving the birthright is a matter of predestination
Jacob, the one predestinated to have the birthright, was very covetous and did everything possible to get the birthright himself
If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that Esau, as a hunter, was strong and rather large in physical stature
Because Jacob was smaller and weaker than Esau, he could not obtain the birthright by fighting for it with his physical strength
Although Jacob fought for the birthright in the womb, Esau defeated him, was born first, and gained the birthright
Through his cleverness he gained his mother's cooperation, and Rebekah, who was more clever than Isaac, stood with Jacob
Anyone who engages in exhausting activity, such as hard work or play, afterwards desires some hearty and nourishing food
The second thing Jacob did to gain the birthright was to deceive his father into giving him the blessing of the birthright
Probably Jacob's maneuvering of Esau was initiated by Rebekah who, in all likelihood, had been maneuvering the whole situation
Through the case of the shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob, we see that the birthright depends on God's sovereignty
He 'put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first'
The third case of the shifting of the birthright, the shifting from Reuben to Joseph , contains a strong warning
God had intended to give the birthright to Reuben, the firstborn, but Reuben lost it by indulging in defilement
In the Bible God exercised a special judgment over Sodom because the people there indulged in lust without any restriction
There will be no need for God to judge you deliberately because a natural judgment will come upon you spontaneously
The case of Reuben reveals that, although you may be predestinated to have the birthright, you may lose it by indulging in fornication
He might have remembered how he had maneuvered his brother to obtain the birthright and deceived his father to receive the blessing
After a number of years you will feel ashamed of what you have done and say, 'What a shame it was to do those things'!
Now we come to the last case of the shifting of the birthright in the Scriptures, the shifting of the birthright from Israel to the church
In Exodus 4:22, the Lord said to Moses, 'Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn'
By this we see that the Pharisees lost the enjoyment of Christ, but the repentant publicans and sinners gained this enjoyment
The repentant and believing sinners have become the constituent of the church, and the church today is called the church of the firstborn
In this message we shall consider another manifestation of Jacob's maturity in life: his prophesying with blessing
Although we are familiar with what it means to prophesy, we may not be familiar with prophesying with blessing
Although Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33 is close to what is found in Genesis 49, the blessing there is not as rich as the blessing here
Both portions of the Word are prophecies concerning Israel, but in Genesis 49 there is a richer blessing than in Deuteronomy 33
The prophesying in chapter forty-nine is a manifestation of maturity, for our speaking always reveals where we are and how mature we are
If you are a high person, you will not speak in a low way, and if you are a low person, you will not speak on a high level
When the opportunity finally came, the first word out of Jacob's mouth recorded in Scripture was the word about selling the birthright
When Isaac asked how he had found the venison so quickly, Jacob said, 'Because the Lord thy God brought it to me'
Isaac said, 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau' , and he asked, 'Art thou my very son Esau'?
Jacob's speaking in chapters twenty-nine through thirty-two is full of self-interest, self-ambition, and self-gain
After some years have gone by and you have had much more growth in life, you will not speak no matter how great the temptation is
The reason for their not talking will not be that they are unhappy; it will be the fact that they have grown in life
Although few among us have come to the level of this experience of life, this message is still needed as part of our life-study of Genesis
You may think that, because it should be easy for a father to know his son, it was easy for Jacob to know his twelve sons
If we would speak such a word in the church, we must know the church, the elders, and all the brothers and sisters
We should not know people according to our mental understanding; rather, we must know them according to the spirit
As he was prophesying with blessing, this heavenly x-ray made the situation of each son crystal clear in his sight
Whether we consider his word a prophecy or a blessing, it is the kind of speaking that is lacking in the churches today
Although Paul simply gave his opinion, for more than nineteen hundred years, his opinion has been regarded as the word of God
The reason Paul was bold to speak this way is given in verse 25: he had 'received mercy of the Lord to be faithful'
Although he did not have the assurance that he had the Spirit of God, we all recognize chapter seven of 1 Corinthians as the word of God
It was the utterance of a man who was filled with God, a man who had been constituted with God in his entire being
At the time of chapter forty-nine, Jacob was a God-man, a man filled, constituted, permeated, and even reorganized with God
Whatever he spoke was God's word; whatever he thought was God's thought; and whatever opinion he expressed was God's opinion
My burden in this message is to impress you all, especially the young people, with this fact that your speaking exposes where you are
Whenever you are talkative you should be reminded that your talkativeness is a sign that you need to grow in life
Genesis 49:2 says, 'Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father'
In this maturity we are divinely knowledgeable, knowing thoroughly the things of God and the situations of other people
In the previous message we pointed out that although this word of prophecy was spoken by a man, it was nonetheless the word of God
According to the record of Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
In the Old Testament we have a house, the house of Israel, and in the New Testament we also have a house, the church of the living God
In a sense, this is correct, for we should not mix God's word concerning the house of Israel with His word concerning the church
When we examine the picture in the Old Testament, we are able to understand many aspects of the church revealed in the New Testament
In most cases of the shifting of the birthright in the Bible, the birthright is shifted from the first to the second
Be impressed with the fact that it is possible for your natural status to be changed either for the better or for the worse
Here in Genesis 49 there is some good news for those who have been disappointed about their natural disposition
What Simeon and Levi had done made such a deep impression on Jacob's spirit that he could not grant them any blessing
Although Jacob loved his sons and was very concerned about them, he could not give a blessing to Simeon and Levi
The word regarding Simeon and Levi being brethren means that they were companions, that they formed one company
Because Reuben was corrupted, defiled, and full of germs, in Jacob's blessing with prophecy he is isolated from all the other brothers
As Jacob was prophesying regarding Reuben in chapter fortynine he undoubtedly remembered that he had already given the birthright to Joseph
Although other sins may not damage our body, fornication causes direct damage to our physical body, a vessel of honor
Not only do we bear the image of God in our physical body, but after regeneration our body is the temple of God
A certain group declared that because they had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, they no longer had any lusts
Because of the fornication among this group, the door to the gospel was closed in that district for quite a period of time
The double portion of the land signifies the top portion of the enjoyment of the riches of the all-inclusive Christ
Not only the young people but even those who are middle-aged must be aware of the danger of being alone with a member of the opposite sex
Do not say that my word is the word of a conservative Chinese man from the Far East, and that you live in modern America
Again and again in the New Testament the Apostle Paul issued the warning that no fornicator would have any inheritance in the kingdom of God
Remember, due to his defilement, Reuben's natural status, the status derived from birth, was altogether changed
As an old judge, he judged the twelve tribes according to God's righteous law, but he nonetheless judged mercifully and sympathetically
By this we see that fornication not only causes us to lose our birthright; it may also cause us to die or to be decreased
He will not only lose the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ; he will be in danger of dying or of being reduced
The birthright is composed not only of the double portion of the land, but also of the kingship and the priesthood
Due to his defilement, he lost not only the double portion of the land, but also the kingship and the priesthood
As we have seen, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah , and the priesthood was given to Levi
Because 'the part of the children of Judah was too much for them,' Simeon was scattered among the people of Judah
Although Simeon and Levi were companions, Levi eventually took the opportunity to have his natural disposition changed
When Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets and saw the people worshipping the golden calf, he said, 'Who is on the Lord's side?
In order to do this, you must exercise your disposition against your desire and use it in a new way, a way that is both for God and with God
Simeon might have said It was all right to kill the people of Shechem but it is crazy to kill our brothers our children and our relatives
God's Thummim and Urim were with him , and he had the privilege of coming into the presence of God to serve Him
The sinners do not need to run to a cathedral; they simply need to flee to God's refuge, to the cities where God's priests dwell
We must be desperate, absolute, and faithful to slay our fleshly desires so that we may be God's Levites, God's priests
If we are Levites, then wherever we live, our dwelling place will be a city of refuge into which sinners may run for salvation
In the order according to blessing, the first three sons are Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, the same as in the order according to birth
In the order according to birth Issachar precedes Zebulun, but in the order according to blessing Zebulun comes before Issachar
According to birth, the order was Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, but according to blessing, it is Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali
Later we shall see that Gad was moved from this group and replaced Levi in the group with Reuben for encamping
The fourth group is composed of the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, the same according to blessing as according to birth
The arrangement of the tribes around the tabernacle went from the east, to the south, to the west, and then to the north
Gad was placed with Reuben and Simeon because Levi had been uplifted and taken into the tabernacle, the center of the camp
In the foregoing message we considered the first group in the order according to blessing in Genesis 49: Reuben, Simeon, and Levi
In that message we saw mainly the changing of the birthright and the transformation of the natural disposition
The outstanding feature of the first group is that it reveals that our natural status and disposition can be changed
When those who oppose the allegorizing of the Bible read this portion of the Word, they will have no way to understand it
In order to understand verses 8 through 12, we must apply these verses to Christ and substitute the name of Christ for Judah
Now we are qualified to come into the presence of God and, with the Urim and Thummim, to receive God's vision and God's revelation
To place the hand on the neck of our enemies means to defeat them, to subdue them, and to gain the victory over them
Verse 9 says Judah is a young lion from the prey my son thou art gone up and verse 8 says Thy hand shall be upon the neck of thine enemies
The words, 'From the prey, my son, thou art gone up,' mean that the lion has gone up the mountain to devour his prey
According to the poetry of verse 9, after devouring His prey, Christ was satisfied and couched to enjoy His rest
He went to the cross and captured them, and in resurrection He led a train of vanquished foes to the heavens for His enjoyment
If you see this, you will forget your enemies, your temper, and the troubles caused by parents and children, and you will say, 'Hallelujah!
Isaiah 2:1 through 3 and 11:10 indicate that from the beginning of the millennium at the Lord's second coming, all nations will obey Christ
In the Bible an ass, or donkey, signifies one who labors very hard, especially laboring in the matter of transportation
Although an ass is usually used for labor in travel, in verse 11 the ass is not laboring; it is bound to the vine
During the millennium there will be no labor because all the labor will have been completed in the preceding dispensations
Just as the source of the wine is the vineyards, the source of the milk is the sheepfolds spoken of in verse 14
Because we have already entered into rest and have come to our destination, there should be no laboring or journeying
Verse 13 says, 'Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon'
Christ began His ministry from Zebulun in Galilee, and it was the Galileans who brought the glad tidings of Christ to all the earth
They brought forth the good news of Christ as the fighting, resting, and producing lion to every part of the world represented by Zidon
All the Galileans went out with the glad tidings of the victory of Christ bearing the word of the victorious restful and productive Christ
Through the enjoyment of these riches they become willing to bow their shoulder take up a burden and serve for tribute rendered to the King
By this enjoyment we are willing to bow our shoulder and lift up a heavy burden, serving to gain tribute to render to our Master, our King
Although this will be completely fulfilled in the millennium, we have a foretaste of it in the church life today
The language used to describe the group composed of Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar is strange, new, and foreign to our understanding
That night at Peniel Jacob exercised all his energy to grasp God, to supplant Him, and to compel Him to do something for him
If we saw the situation from God's viewpoint, we would realize that in the eyes of God the church is a country of lions
When the children of Israel were pursued by the Egyptians, the Lord told Moses to lift up his rod and stretch out his hand over the sea
Because we are under the heavenly ruling, we have the position and the right to speak to difficulties, hardships, and attacks
In the kingdom everything has been accomplished, every enemy has been defeated, and every problem has been solved
Verse 10 says that the scepter will not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes
When Jesus was about to go up into a mountain to pray He charged His disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side
Eventually, after praying there on the mountaintop, the Lord came to the disciples in the boat, walking on the sea
Where the authority and kingdom of Christ hold sway, there will be the submission and obedience of the peoples
How often have you heard that you must cease from your striving and simply rest in Christ, the source of life?
Of striving and competing, you should tie your donkey to the vine, which is Christ, the source of life, the One who is full of life
Are you a Christian who does not know how to be happy, who always has a wrinkled brow and a long face, who always looks sad?
In order to take in the Word of God as our nourishment and to utter it for others' nourishment, we must have healthy teeth
We in the church life are ceasing from our labor resting in Christ and enjoying the riches of Christs life as grape wine and as grape juice
These seeds, requiring the Old and the New Testaments for their development, are the real glad tidings, the true gospel
Remember, the first tribe in the second group is Judah, and the most significant aspect of the record concerning Judah is the lion
Verse 9 says, 'Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he couches, he lies down as a lion, and as a lioness'
Revelation, however, simply speaks of the Lion of the tribe of Judah in a general way, saying nothing of these detailed aspects
Genesis 49 reveals that Judah is a lion in three aspects, but the New Testament only gives us an interpretation in a general way
Some Christian teachers argue that if the New Testament does not speak about a certain thing, we should not say anything about it either
Although there is a very clear interpretation of Judah in Revelation 5, what is spoken in the New Testament concerning Zebulun and Issachar?
There is a partial interpretation of Zebulun in Matthew 4:15, but there is no interpretation whatever of Issachar
According to those who insist that we should be silent when the New Testament is silent, we should not say anything about Issachar
Would there be a spiritual significance to Judah, but no spiritual significance to the other tribes in the same group?
Following the threefold mention of the lion, we have in verse 10 the scepter and the ruler's staff, denoting the kingship and the kingdom
As the New Testament only gives us the interpretation for verse 9 in Revelation 55 there should be some interpretations for verses 11 and 12
The Lord would say, 'If you look into the Bible, you would see that a donkey is used for journeying toward a goal
The tribe of Judah dwelt in hilly country, in the region around Mount Zion, where the capital of the nation was located
Judah signifies the victorious Christ, the One who gained the victory for the kingdom so that His people may rest in Him
After His resurrection the angel charged the women to tell the disciples Behold He goes before you into Galilee there you shall see Him
Judah signifies the gospel composed of the victorious Christ, the kingdom of Christ, and the rest in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
According to spiritual history, the book of Acts follows the four Gospels, and the Acts is the book of the Galilean preachers
In Acts the early preachers sailed from the holy land to Asia Minor and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, Rome, and Spain
As he sought to interpret the significance of Zebulun, he must have forgotten Judah, the first tribe in this group
In the New Testament, we see that Zebulun was in Galilee of the nations, whence the Galilean preachers were sent forth
According to history, after the gospel was produced in Judah, the preaching of the gospel was carried out by Zebulun
In the record of Judah the significant word is lion, and in the record of Zebulun the significant word is ships
Jacob likened Zebulun to ships, which, of course, are for going out, and Moses told Zebulun to rejoice in his going out
If you are a ship sailing by the power of the heavenly wind, you will be happy, rejoicing, and beside yourself with joy
Notice that this couching donkey is not resting in the sheepfolds; rather, he is resting between the sheepfolds
As we are resting in the church life among the denominational folds, we enjoy the good rest and the rich pleasant land
As we are resting in the church life among the denominations we see the good rest and the pleasant land which is Christ as our green pasture
In the church life we all are donkeys couching down among the divisions, seeing the good rest, and enjoying Christ as the pleasant land
In the millennial kingdom all the peoples, the nations, will be invited through preaching to God's kingdom in Mount Zion
Due to the preaching and the church life that is due to Zebulun and Issachar the peoples are invited to Gods kingdom to the mountain of God
All the sacrifices we offer to God in the church life are of righteousness, according to the righteous requirement of God
In order to interpret this portion of the verse, we must consider the parables of the treasure and the pearl in Matthew 13:44-46
He gave a number of messages expounding Genesis 49, showing us how these prophecies were fulfilled in the following books of the Bible
Because he did not know the spiritual significance of the figures, he did not apply any of them to today's Christian experience
Although this prophecy with blessing begins with a sinner, it ends with the two beloved sons of Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin
Following him is Zebulun, the haven for shipping out the gospel, and Issachar, the enjoyment of the church life
We have to declare that in the church there are no Reubens and no Simeons and that all the Levis have become priests
Because Christ is here, we have the glad tidings that are shipped out through the preaching of the gospel, and we have the church life
On the one hand, we are the haven to ship out Christ; on the other hand, we are the tents to stay with Christ in the full enjoyment of Him
The crucial figure in the second group is the lion; and Dan, the first of the third group, is also called a lion
According to the book of Deuteronomy, in the good land there should have been only one center of worship for God's people
During the time of the book of Judges, the center of worship was in Shiloh, where God's tabernacle and priests were
Immediately after Dan's victory, another center of worship, with the idol made by Micah, was established in the city of Dan
If you consider the history of Christianity, you will see that this kind of thing has happened again and again
It is a shame and a sorrow to say that during the past fifteen years at least two or three who were once among us have done this very thing
They gained something, but that gain made them proud and independent, unwilling to submit to what the Lord has ordained
By reading the historical books in the Old Testament, we see that by taking in this idol Dan truly became a horned snake
As they were riding on, Dan bit the heels of the horse and caused them to fall backward; that is, he frustrated them from going on
According to the Mosaic law, anyone who set up an idol or worshipped an idol had to be cut off from the people
Jacob's word meant not only that Dan would remain as a tribe, but also that Dan would be a scepter, an authority
There is the definite possibility that in a certain period of time and in a certain situation we may be omitted in the record of Gods people
Dan ends with failure, but Gad, who shall raid the heels of the raiding band, comes in with the recovered victory
In Deuteronomy 33 the lioness is not couching for enjoyment; she is dwelling, settling down, and tearing the enemy to pieces
Deuteronomy 33:21 says of Gad, 'He provided the first part for himself, for there a portion of the lawgiver was reserved'
According to the history in the Old Testament, the first part refers to the first part of the good land east of the Jordan River
If the two and a half tribes had stayed there and had not gone on to fight for the rest of the land, they would not have been just
Verse 21 also says, 'And he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his ordinances with Israel'
Gad helps us to know that even after we have gained the victory and have been enlarged, we should not forget our brothers
We should not establish another center, but we should take care of our brothers, fighting for the sake of their portion
When we have the victory of Christ and help our brothers gain their portion before we enjoy our own, we have rich food
The fact that Asher will dip his foot in oil indicates that, as far as food is concerned, he is richer than all the other tribes
When you have arrived at this stage, there is no need to worry or care about tomorrow, and there is no anxiety
With Naphtali we have not only the victorious Christ as a lion, but the resurrected Christ as a released hind skipping on the mountaintops
For Naphtali to possess the west is to possess the Mediterranean Sea, which was on the west of Naphtali's portion of the good land
In order for this to take place, we must first rest in Christ and then soak our being, our behavior, in the riches of the life of Christ
After the apostasy of Dan, we have the recovery with Gad, the sufficiency in Asher, and the consummation with Naphtali
Throughout the years in the recovery we have been with Judah, binding our donkey to the vine and soaking our garments in wine
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'When you enter into the good land, you must not offer your burnt offerings in any of the places you see
The reason the Lord commanded Moses to issue this charge repeatedly was that He was concerned about maintaining the unity of His people
If Dan had not set up another center of worship, there would have been only the unique center of worship in Shiloh
After Dan set up his center of worship in the north, he used the matter of convenience as a good selling point for his cargo
The Danites could use the convenient location of their worship center to persuade their neighbors to meet with them for the worship of God
Suppose you were a neighbor of the Danites and one of them said to you, 'Brother, why are you so foolish as to travel all the way to Shiloh?
Today there is much competition in Christian salesmanship, with every Christian group trying to sell its cargo
Judges 18:31 says, 'And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh'
Jeroboam feared that if the people went to worship at Jerusalem, they would return to Rehoboam, the king of Judah
The temple in Jerusalem was built by a king, Solomon, and the divisive center was also strengthened by a king, Jeroboam
Fifteen years ago terms such as the life-giving Spirit and the human spirit could not be heard among Christians in the United States
The Roman Catholic Church does exactly the same thing Jeroboam did when he set up the idols and said, 'Behold thy gods, O Israel'
Pember, one of the idols in the Roman Catholic Church is Buddha, who was assimilated into Catholicism under the name of St
There may have been times when we were distracted from the right way in following God and fell into a type of apostasy
Whenever you become divisive, no matter how good your reason may be, there will be something behind you the serpent, the subtle one
Whenever you do not care for others, but only for your interests, doing something merely for yourself, the serpent is at hand
Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 forbid us to have any other center of worship that we may come to the unique center'
The best aspect of Gad is not merely that he crushed the enemy's head, but that he would not enjoy his victory by himself
Although he gained land on the east of the Jordan, he would not enjoy it until the other tribes had won their portion of the land
Gad went with the other tribes to fight the battle to gain more land so that all the tribes might be able to have their share
The New Testament interpretation of this Old Testament figure is that we must always take care of the brothers, the members of the Body
He came with the heads of the people, the princes of the other tribes, to fight the battle for the rest of the land
When the children of Israel entered the good land, it was God's will in His justice that His people be settled
God did not want only Gad; He wanted all the twelve tribes to be settled to become His kingdom that His ordinances may be observed
Romans 12:1 and 2 say that if we present our bodies a living sacrifice, we shall be able to prove what the will of God is
To have the Body life, to take care of the needs of others, is to execute God's justice for observing His ordinances
God's New Testament ordinances can only be observed in the Body of Christ, which is built up by the mutual care of its members in justice
When you forget your own spiritual interests and care for all the other brothers, that is, care for the Body, you are a Gad
In Dan's apostasy we lost all the blessing and the grace, but in Gad's victory the blessing was recovered and the grace was returned
The fat bread and royal dainties are for Asher's living and growing, and the iron and copper are minerals for fighting and building
In Matthew 28 and Acts 2 we see that the speaking of the pleasant words is intimately related to the resurrected Christ
Rich words, pleasant words, beautiful words, words of joy and life all these come out of the experience of the resurrected Christ
The favor and blessing here link Naphtali with Asher, who is more blessed than the sons and favored among his brothers
We all can testify that in the Lord's recovery we are satisfied with the rich grace and full of the rich blessing
Without Joseph and Benjamin, the history and significance of the twelve tribes of Jacob would have no conclusion
We have seen that the history of God's people begins with sinners, for we were all sinners like Reuben, Simeon, and Levi
Eventually these sinners are transformed into Levis with the priesthood and even into Judahs with the kingship
Although children had also been born to the maids of Rachel and Leah, Rachel herself did not bear any children until ten sons had been born
Eventually, Joseph received the birthright and through his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, inherited the double portion of the land
The fact that Joseph was the eleventh son and Benjamin, the twelfth indicates that they were close to each other in sequence
Later they became the three tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, which were encamped at the rear of God's dwelling place
Genesis 49:22 says, 'A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the wall'
The God of Abraham refers to God the Father, the God of Isaac refers to God the Son, and the God of Jacob refers to God the Spirit
As we have pointed out, we should not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three persons, but as three aspects of one person
If we touch the spirit of the Bible, we shall see that, as a fruitful person, Jacob signifies the producing God
We are told that Joseph, as the son of Jacob, branches out all the riches of this tree that come from the fountain
He was not limited to the good land, but he ran out over the wall to Egypt, spreading beyond the limits of the good land into another region
These branches run over all limitations, for example, the limitations of family, school, or the restrictions of the opposition
No matter how high the opposing wall may be, the very Christ within us will run over the wall by means of the many branches
Verse 24 says, 'But his bow remained firm, and the arms of his hands were made strong and agile by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob; '
Verse 25 says, 'Even by the God of thy father, who helpeth thee; and by the All-sufficient, who blesseth thee'
From ancient times to eternity all of time is included and from heaven to earth including the deep under the earth all of space is included
Later we shall see that the One who dwelt in the bush will dwell in the temple, in the church, and then in the New Jerusalem
Formerly, God dwelt among the bushes, but eventually He will dwell among the precious stones in the New Jerusalem
He was the first Nazarite in the Bible, separate from his brothers, and Christ became the real Nazarite, separate from all the people
Joseph typified Christ as the Nazarite, the One who was separated from the common people to live wholly for God
For centuries, the Russians, inhabitants of a cold region, have been trying to spread to the south, to the Mediterranean Sea
The crucial center of international relations today is the Middle East, and many nations want to spread into that region
Genesis 49:27 says, 'Benjamin is a tearing wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and in the evening he shall divide the spoil'
In the morning he will devour the prey, and in the evening he will divide the spoil, that is, prepare the spoil for the next morning's meal
We need to point out that Jerusalem was not located in the territory of Judah, but in the territory of Benjamin
In Genesis chapter three we all were sinners but at the end of the Bible in Revelation 21 and 22 we all become Benjamin the dwelling of God
Eventually, in the church life there will be only Joseph and Benjamin, the blessing of the Lord and the dwelling of God
The conclusion of the entire Bible as the record of the history of God's people is the universal blessing and the eternal habitation of God
The new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem portray the universal blessing inherited by Christ and God's habitation
If you put together the record of these twelve sons according to Genesis 49, you will have a portrait of yourself
Sinners become God's priests and kings, and ultimately they are under His universal blessing and become His eternal dwelling
In the eyes of God, Abraham and Isaac each had just one son, for God counted only Isaac and Jacob, not Ishmael or Esau
One day, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was divided into two parts with ten tribes in one part and two in the other
We need to remember the names of Jacobs twelve sons Reuben Simeon Levi Judah Zebulun Issachar Dan Gad Asher Naphtali Joseph and Benjamin
Genesis 49:22 says, 'A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the wall'
At that time in Egypt Joseph was not simply branching out personally; he was branching out God's administration with seventy people
Throughout the centuries, all who have loved the Lord and who have been occupied with Him have also been fruitful
Sometimes we may say, 'We are weak, our situation is not promising, the increase is coming slowly, and the number remains small'
If you have the heavenly view, you will see that the church is very fruitful and that the history of the church is a history of fruitfulness
These branches are branching out over the wall that is they are spreading Christ over all restrictions magnifying Him in all circumstances
Brother Nee, raised up by the Lord in China, was certainly a bough of a fruitful tree, a branch of the fruitful Christ
Since Brother Nee was under the helping hand of Miss Barber, he was simultaneously also under the help of Miss Gross
One day Miss Gross heard the report that a woman was living with Brother Nee, and she came to him to check with him about this
Brother Nee was still single, and, like Miss Barber, Miss Gross, as an elderly sister, loved him and was very concerned about him
When Brother Nee answered, 'Yes,' Miss Gross rebuked him, asking how he, a single young man, could have a woman staying with him
Today many rumors are being circulated about us, but as yet none of them are as evil as the rumors spread about Brother Nee
Prior to this, instead of attending services of their fathers' denominations, they went to operas, theaters, and gambling places
When some of them were attracted to the church life and caught by it, the pastors began to warn them not to attend the meetings
Genesis 49:23 and 24 say, 'The archers have bitterly harassed him, and shot at him, and lay in wait for him: but his bow remained firm'
Today in the Lord's recovery we are empowered in the grace of Christ to withstand all opposition for the Lord's testimony
Speaking about overthrowing reasonings and every high thing and about capturing thoughts is not nice, humble, gentle, mild, or kind
The opposers joined forces to squeeze us, but there was the pushing victory, the pushing strength, and the pushing horns
We in the Lord's recovery today are all Josephs strong in tearing the opposition and in pushing the opposition away
Many of you have read the booklet entitled, What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!
If you say that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not the Father of the Godhead, then you hold the heresy of believing in two divine Fathers
Do you intend to cut your feet to fit into your little shoes, or will you get a pair of shoes to fit your feet?
The New Testament also speaks of the life-giving Spirit, but does the Nicene Creed contain any reference to the life-giving Spirit?
We must not reduce the vision to match the shoes; rather, we must throw away those old shoes and take the pure word of the Bible
These verses indicate why Joseph and Benjamin became the ultimate consummation: they trusted in the mighty One of Jacob
The New Testament equivalent for trusting in the Allsufficient is Philippians 413 which says I can do all things in Him who empowers me
The equivalent of the Shepherd of Israel is seen in 1 Peter 5:4, which says that Christ, the Chief Shepherd, will appear
In Jacob's prophetic blessing of Joseph we see that Joseph's fruitfulness and victory came out of his trust in the Lord
We follow in their footsteps to trust in their God who is the mighty One the allsufficient One the Shepherd the rock and the foundation
The history of these twelve sons begins with a sinner, that is, it begins with sin, even with a gross sin, not a refined sin
At the beginning we have a person who is full of sin, and at the end we have a person who receives the universal blessing
The spiritual blessings are of a heavenly nature, in a heavenly situation and atmosphere, and under a heavenly condition
According to the New Testament reality and fulfillment, the precious things of heaven above are the blessings in the heavenlies
Psalm 133 says that the blessing upon the unity of the brothers is like the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion
The blessings upon Joseph begin with heaven above, proceed to the snow and the dew in the air, and then go on to the springs in the earth
Since the sun is a type of Christ, the spiritual fruits brought forth by the sun signify all the riches of Christ
It is easy to say that Christ is everything to us; however, it is not so easy to itemize all the aspects of what He is to us
We receive forgiveness justification reconciliation redemption and eternal life not directly from Christ but indirectly through the churches
Thessalonians 2:14 says, 'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus'
Whatever they learned and experienced was put forth to the Gentile churches, and the Gentile churches enjoyed their fruit
Nearly all the riches of Christ we enjoy day by day do not come directly from Christ, but come indirectly through the churches
The mountains, the hills, and the utmost bound imply all of space, including even the meeting hall and your place of dwelling
When you get into the new heaven and the new earth, you will see that at every time and in every place there will be a blessing
If he believes in the Lord, he will become another Joseph, and then whatever happens to him will be a blessing
We need to see the vision that we are Josephs, that we are the blessed people, that we are under God's blessing
It does not make any difference whether our children are nice or naughty, whether our husband or wife is easy to live with or difficult
It is very interesting to see that the short record of Jacob's prophetic blessing issues in the same conclusion as does the entire Bible
Hallelujah, the church in the Lord's recovery today is a miniature of the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling!
Ephesians 1:23 speaks of the Body, and Ephesians 2:22 speaks of the habitation, both of which are symbols of God's dwelling
God has blessed us with all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies for the purpose that we might become His dwelling
God's blessing fills the universe, from eternity past to eternity future and from the heavens above to the depths underneath the earth
In this poetic utterance, the womb signifies the producing of life, the begetting of life, and the breasts signify the nourishment of life
On the fifth day God blessed the living creatures in the waters and the fowl in the air, and on the sixth day He blessed man
In the New Testament we see that the producing life is not the animal life nor the human life, but the eternal life
If you simply read Genesis 49 according to the black and white, you will not see the matter of the producing and nourishing life
Hallelujah, in the church life we have the blessing of life, the blessing of the breasts and of the womb, the blessing of the flowing river!
If the producing animals and human beings were taken away from the earth, the whole meaning of the universe would be lost
Although you may read the Bible and be able to recite many verses, you cannot see anything until the vision comes
In the entire Old Testament, there is no blessing higher, greater, or sweeter than the blessing of God's dwelling place
Eventually, the entire New Jerusalem will be an eternal tabernacle, the central blessing among God's blessings
The new heaven and new earth will be a blessing, but the center of that blessing will be the New Jerusalem, God's tabernacle
According to geography, the territory of Benjamin is shaped like two shoulders, and Jerusalem is located between the two shoulders
If you consider your experience, you will realize how real it is that God dwells between our shoulders to be our Head
The tabernacle was a covering, for Revelation 7:15 says, 'He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them'
In Isaiah 66:1 we see that heaven is God's throne and the earth is His footstool, but God does not yet have a place of rest
They are filled with so many things, even fundamental things, that there is no room in their spirit for the Lord
No matter how long you have been in the church life, you need to pray such a prayer, to ask the Lord to have His dwelling in you
Many of us can testify that since the day we were saved, we have never been as satisfied in our spirit as we are in the church life today
The old heaven and the old earth, including the old environment, will be terminated, but the church life we are in today will last forever
In the last two chapters of Revelation there are two main things: the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling of God with men
After the gospel was shipped out by Zebulun, Issachar came in as rest, rest in the gospel accomplished by Judah and preached by Zebulun
If you read the record of these two sons carefully, you will see that there is no account of any defect or failure in them
Although there is a long record regarding Joseph in the Bible, there is no hint that he was wrong in anything or that he failed
The kingly salvation has been preached as the gospel of the kingdom, and the saved ones have come to rest in this gospel
In Revelation 21:1 John saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away
If we expect to receive blessing from God with respect to our spiritual life health our families or our homes all these things must be new
According to the Bible, anything that is kept away from God is old, but anything that comes back to God is new
As strange as it may sound, even a desk, a table, or a chair, if they are consecrated to the Lord, can become new
The new heaven and the new earth will be filled with God's blessing because the first heaven and the first earth will have passed away
When the sea has been eliminated, there will be no more tears, no more death, no more weakness, and no more sickness
Although you may have read the Bible for years, you have probably never realized that the source of sorrow, crying, and pain is the sea
If there are one thousand saints and God is dwelling among them, they will consider God to be number one thousand one
If one thousand saints are together and God is among them, God is not number one thousand one; rather, He is in the one thousand saints
The Bible is filled with the thought that God is mingled with His people, for God's people become His dwelling place
Pay no attention to the misleading teaching that there is no mingling of God and man and that we do not have the divine nature in us
In the Old Testament the temple was not only the dwelling place of God, but also the place in which the priests served God
In the eternal dwelling God within us will be our light, and Christ will be our lamp to express the very God who is within us
There is Joseph, indicating that God has become our blessing, and Benjamin, indicating that we have become God's dwelling place
The quality of a man's life and the outcome of his life are determined primarily by the last stage of his life, not by the first stage
Throughout his life, Jacob became involved not only with his wives and sons, but also with various geographical regions
If we put together all the portions of the Word that speak of Jacobs involvements we shall rejoice before the Lord and say Praise the Lord!
More than three chapters are given to the account of Jacob's departure, but only a few verses are given to Paul's
Why did Jacob not have Joseph raise his hand if the significance of this act were only that of taking an oath?
The covenant of circumcision means that the covenant of grace cannot be fulfilled or inherited through man's natural strength
When you cannot do anything, when you are not able to move, and when you have no strength, that is the time for you to trust in God
Jacob asked him to place his hand under his thigh, recognizing by making this request that he had been dealt with by God to the uttermost
To him, that promise was the promise of circumcision, of terminating his natural strength to inherit God's promise
It was not by Jacob's strength, but by the hand of Joseph, that Jacob was brought to the good land for his actual inheritance
He believed that one day the good land promised by God would be the portion, the inheritance, of his descendants
The record of Jacob's departure makes no mention of his illness, of his will, or of the way he distributed his properties among his children
According to Hebrews 11:13, he was among those who died in faith expecting one day to enter into what God had promised
Jacob asked Joseph to put his hand under his thigh, indicating that Jacob put his full trust in the hand of God's grace
Jacob put his hands upon the staff indicating that he recognized that he had always been under Gods care of grace throughout his entire life
Jacob, however, desired to make the two sons of Joseph, who was born of Rachel, his first two sons to replace Reuben and Simeon
The birthright among Jacobs sons was shifted from Reuben to Joseph through Jacobs desire to remember Rachel who was continually on his heart
God honored what Jacob did and made it a fact by the allotting of the land at the time the children of Israel entered the good land
Sovereignly when the portions of the land were allotted under Joshua the portion Jacob gave to Joseph was allotted to Ephraim and Manasseh
The fact that Jacob could prophesy in such a way was a strong sign and manifestation that he was matured in life
If we read superficially we shall not be able to understand why the events of chapter thirtyeight are put after those of chapter thirtyseven
Not until we discover the spiritual significance of these chapters can we appreciate the deep meaning of their sequence
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three aspects of one person, somewhat like the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three of the Godhead
In a similar way, spiritually speaking, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate persons, but three aspects of one complete person
After he had been called and justified, and while he was living a life by faith, he inherited all the riches of Christ and enjoyed them
In this message we come to the reigning aspect of the matured Israel, an aspect fully portrayed in the biography of Joseph
Genesis blends the biographies of Joseph and Jacob because they are actually the biography not of two persons, but of one
If you read the record in Genesis from chapter thirty-seven through chapter fifty, you will see that Joseph is an aspect, a part, of Jacob
In the Bible Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament
The Bible does not say that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and the God of Joseph
In 1:26, when God created man, He said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion
The exercise of God's dominion over all things is manifested in Joseph's life, whereas God's image is expressed in Israel
If one has been a Christian for years but has never struggled, it means that he is not one who is seeking the Lord
Once we realize something about the birthright we shall struggle to be holy and spiritual and our Jacobean struggling nature will come out
After passing through all these experiences, the matured saint has an aspect that is constituted solely of Christ
Even if you have just been regenerated, a part of you, your regenerated spirit, has been constituted of Christ
The process of being constituted of Christ will continue until it reaches its climax when the reigning aspect comes forth in you
If the aspect of you which is constituted of Christ is not perfect, then surely no part of you could be perfect
In us who are fallen, saved, called, redeemed, and regenerated there is nothing perfect except the constituting Christ
Shepherding is not a matter of our instigating others to do something, but of Christ's constitution within them
The words spoken of the Lord Jesus at His baptism and on the Mount of Transfiguration have also been spoken to you
Whenever you have this sense, it is a proof that you have the constitution of Christ, which is pleasing to the Father
The reason for this is that we have two constitutions, the constitution of Christ and the constitution of the old Adam
Joseph represents the very constitution of Christ in the matured life of Israel, that part which is called by the Father, 'My beloved'
In this matter also Joseph was a type of Christ, for Christ came down from heaven to do the will of the One who had sent Him
Joseph, a descendant of Isaac, was sold to the descendants of Ishmael and Midian, to the Ishmaelites, the Midianites
When the Jewish leaders delivered Jesus to Pilate, they were no longer Israelites; they were Ishmaelites and Midianites
Through the flesh, the Jewish leaders delivered Christ to Pilate, the Roman authority, who certainly was in Egypt, that is, in the world
According to chapter thirtyseven Josephs brothers were full of hatred and anger and according to chapter thirtyeight they were full of lust
In chapter thirty-seven we see the hatred and anger of Joseph's brothers, and in chapter thirty-eight we see Judah's lust
If we do not have experience, we shall not be able to understand the word in the Bible regarding Joseph's dream of the sheaves
The more you love the church and care for the saints, the more 'gophers,' 'turtles,' and 'scorpions' you will see
God spoke through Balaam, and Balaam said, 'He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel'
If you say that it is a lie to speak this way and that you cannot do it, it means that you have not seen the dream, the vision
As God views His people from the standpoint of eternity He sees them all as sheaves full of life and as the sun moon and stars full of light
If you use the divine telescope to see through time, you will behold the New Jerusalem where there is nothing but sheaves and stars
Although Joseph saw these two dreams, he still suffered the hatred and conspiracy of his brothers in that very chapter
Out of the gross sin committed in chapter thirty-eight, two sons were born, the first of whom was a forefather of Christ
Do not believe that the church is not good, and do not complain against the saints or say that they are 'scorpions'
He is not judging the saints; He is working on them to transform the 'scorpions' into sheaves and the 'gophers' into stars
The first group represents the created race, the Adamic race, whereas the second group represents the called race, the Abrahamic race
Noah's descendants rebelled against God at Babel, and that rebellion resulted in God's giving up of the created race
We see how a called and justified saint can live in the presence of God by faith to enjoy all the riches of the inheritance
In his sufferings God's hand comes upon him to deal with him, and he is dealt with by God until he becomes mature
That part of our being that is constituted with Christ is neither our flesh nor our mind; rather, it is our spirit
The Christ-constituted aspect of our regenerated being is fully represented, portrayed, and typified by Joseph
Because Joseph represents the reigning aspect of a victorious and mature life, his life is recorded in the Bible in such an excellent way
The first three chapters regarding the reigning part of a matured life are chapters thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and thirty-nine
Chapter thirty-eight is a record of Judah's incest, and in chapter thirty-nine we see darkness and the indulgence in lust
If you have not seen the vision of Joseph's dreams, you will be able to know no more than the story contained in these chapters
Joseph conducted himself in such an excellent way as the reigning aspect of a mature life under the direction of this controlling vision
Chapter thirtyseven begins by telling us how Jacob loved his dear son Joseph and how Joseph reported the evils of his brothers to his father
In these days the Lord has shown us that Joseph's dreams reveal the actual situation of God's people in His eyes
According to the sequence of events in these chapters, we see that Joseph's excellent behavior was under the direction of his dreams
In his first dream he saw that he was one of the sheaves; and he was not a sheaf falling down, but a sheaf rising up
He behaved as the sheaf standing up and full of life, and he conducted himself like a heavenly star shining in the darkness
The one Joseph's brothers were plotting to kill was not a thief, but their own brother in the flesh, the dear son of their own father
The record, under God's inspiration, uses fallen anger as the background to demonstrate how much life was in the sheaf
When all the rest had sunk into the death water of human anger, this sheaf emerged and survived in that situation of death
If you have this light as you come to these chapters, you will see that Joseph was one who lived a life that corresponded to his vision
No one can live such a victorious life on this earth, and it is impossible to have the practice of the church life
After coming into the church life, we saw the controlling vision, and powerful brakes were installed in our car
Joseph's life under the heavenly vision was the life of the kingdom of the heavens described in Matthew 5, 6, and 7
According to the constitution of the heavenly kingdom revealed in these chapters in Matthew our anger must be subdued and our lust conquered
We, the kingdom people in the kingdom life, are being trained to be kings, to be Josephs, to be the reigning aspect of the mature life
In the coming kingdom it will be this part that will be the co-kings with Christ in the kingdom of the heavens
Where the presence of the Lord is, there is not only the Lord's authority, but also prosperity brought about by the Lord's sovereignty
While Joseph was undergoing ill-treatment, he enjoyed the prosperity that came to him under the Lord's sovereignty
As such a representative, Joseph typifies Christ, for the reigning aspect of the mature life is Christ constituted into our being
Peter, James, John, and all the other Apostles followed the footsteps of the Lamb, and they also were depreciated
After we were saved and began to seek the Lord, our friends, relatives, and in some cases even our parents began to despise us
Joseph was with two criminals, who typified the two criminals with Christ, one of whom was restored and the other executed
He was rejected by His brothers; then He was sold by one of His people, and eventually He was cast into the prison of death
Even if they were not clear about what He had said, they must have been impressed with something regarding His resurrection
When Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, he was about seventeen years of age; and when he was released from prison, he was thirty
If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that it was not long after Joseph was sold to Potiphar that he was cast into prison
In this country the young people are eager to be eighteen years of age, for then they can be free like birds released from a cage
Joseph was so excited about his dreams that he told his brothers about them, not realizing that they would be offended by them
Some of the young people may think that if they follow Jesus Christ and are in the Lord's recovery, everything will be glorious
According to our natural concept, we think that immediately after we see a vision, something glorious will happen in our life
It was just like Abraham praying for Abimelech to have children when God's promise to him about having a son had not yet been fulfilled
Although they were excited by the visions they saw and the wonderful messages they heard, they were later sold into Egypt
Some latecomers joined them in prison, just as Joseph was joined in his confinement by the chief cupbearer and the baker
Although Joseph's dreams had not yet been fulfilled, he had the faith and the boldness to interpret the dreams of his companions
Do you have the boldness to say that the church life is wonderful, even when you are surrounded by some 'Egyptians'?
Could you say this even when your dream of the church life has not yet been fulfilled and the church life is not wonderful to you?
If your dreams have been fulfilled according to your interpretation, it is easy to interpret the dreams of others
In Joseph's case, even after a period of about ten years, the interpretation of his own dreams had not been fulfilled
Although his dreams had not yet been fulfilled, he still had the boldness and the assurance to interpret dreams for others
Andrew Murray once said a word like this: The good minister of the Word should always minister more than what he has experienced
Before the confirmation of Joseph's dreams, Joseph had faith; and after the confirmation was given, he had more faith
He was so keen in learning English and Chinese that his parents even hired a private teacher to instruct him in the Chinese classics
Because both Brother Nee and his mother had been saved through the preaching of Dora Yu, they respected her very much
It took him a longer time to take some mail from a suburb to the post office in downtown Shanghai than Dora Yu expected
It is not an insignificant matter to be a Joseph, for wherever you go, people will either receive life or suffer death
Either they will go to Christ typified by the vine full of life, or they will be devoured by Satan, represented by the birds of the air
However, he was not suffering; he was learning valuable lessons and experiencing what was necessary for his enthronement
Without the lessons learned during confinement, how could Joseph, a young man, be enthroned in Egypt to rule over the whole country?
After you have been trained through confinement, you will no longer be a youngster; rather, you will be a man qualified under God's training
On the one hand, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life and, on the other hand, typifies Christ in a full way
Throughout the record of Joseph's life there are two lines: the line of the type of Christ and the line of the secret of the reigning life
All Christians should be familiar with three things: the incarnation of Christ, the crucifixion of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ
On the same day Joseph was released from the dungeon, he was enthroned to be the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt
The living conditions in Joseph's dungeon were far worse than the conditions of the prisons in this country today
The proof is in the fact that he was clothed with beautiful garments and made to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh
His being clothed with fine linen was in contrast with his being stripped by his brothers of his coat of many colors
When the prodigal son came home, he received the first two gifts, the ring on his hand and the robe on his body
After we have been saved and have received the garment of righteousness to justify us, we need to go on to live a victorious life
When Christ is lived out of us, He becomes our subjective righteousness, not just something put upon us, but something lived out of us
The unique righteousness in this universe is Christ; yet this righteousness has been given to Christ that He may put it upon His believers
Joseph typified Christ in these three aspects, for these titles are all included in the name Zaphnath-paaneah given to Joseph by Pharaoh
After the fall, however, man was told to eat meat because of the need for the shedding of blood for redemption
In John 12:24 the Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to reproduce by regeneration
Eve typifies the church being a part of Christ, coming out of Christ, returning to Christ, and being one with Christ
Isaac came from a particular source and Abrahams servant was sent to that source to select and call a wife for Isaac and to bring her to him
Asenath portrays the church taken out of the Gentile world by Christ during His rejection by the children of Israel
During the time of this rejection, Christ came to the Gentile world, stayed there, and received the church out of the Gentile world
If in the gospel meetings of the church in Anaheim some fruit is produced, Christ will declare to the whole universe, 'Manasseh!
If Joseph had not stayed in the dungeon for twelve years, he would not have been qualified to rule over the land of Egypt
If this had happened to us, we would have been disappointed to the uttermost and said, 'Forget about this dream
It was the cupbearer who brought the news to Pharaoh that there was someone in prison who could interpret dreams
Concerning the dream, the vision, it matters a great deal whether we say yes or no; for either our yes or our no will come true
Joseph, however, was bold to speak, to interpret Pharaoh's dreams, and through his speaking he was given authority
When you declare that the church life is glorious, you will be in the glorious church life you are speaking into being
When we compare Joseph with the other outstanding men in Genesis, we see that he is unique in dreams and in suffering
The Lord answered their prayers by coming in and doing a marvelous work in the colleges throughout the country
Thousands of students, including a good number of brilliant ones, were captured by the Lord, and many of them saw a vision
These students were afraid of the missionaries, whose goal was to advance their mission work, their mission church
They were fearful that if they spoke something different from what the missionaries were doing, they would get into trouble
As a result of the restoration of Brother Nee's ministry, hundreds of churches were raised up in the cities of China
We published books and a little magazine entitled The Ministry of the Word, which has had more than three hundred issues
Whether the missionaries agreed with us or not, they eventually were subdued and had to admit that ours was the best work in Taiwan
Be prepared first to speak yourself into trouble and then to speak yourself out of trouble and into the fulfillment of your dreams
The goal of our preaching was to build up the local church, but his preaching eventually would help the denominations
Our goal is to build up the local church as the Lord's recovery; and your work would eventually help the denominations'
Suppose when the cupbearer and the baker told Joseph about their dreams, he did not have the faith or the boldness to interpret them
Although Joseph's dreams had not been fulfilled, he was bold to tell Pharaoh that God would give him an answer of peace
To many readers of the book of Genesis, the stories of Joseph are like the stories told to kindergarten children
If we look at the record of Joseph's life from the point of view of a kindergarten child, we shall read it merely as a story for children
If we view the record of Joseph as being the reigning aspect of a mature saint, our understanding will be revolutionized
Genesis 42 therefore which we shall consider in this message is not a kindergarten story it is part of the reigning aspect of a mature life
Two lines run throughout the record of Joseph's life: the line of Joseph as a type of Christ and the line of Joseph's personal life
Genesis 41:56 says, 'And the famine was over all the face of the earth,' and verse 57 says that 'the famine was severe in all lands'
When we eat and drink, we do not merely have the sense that we are maintaining our existence, but that we are being satisfied
If you visit Israel, you will certainly sympathize with them, for they definitely need protection and safety to secure their existence
The prime minister of Israel does not need to go to Washington or to Cairo; instead, he should carry out negotiations with Christ
When they realize that all their struggles are in vain, they will be forced in their desperation to turn to Christ
We who have turned to Christ have found food, nourishment, and satisfaction, for the food is found only where Christ is
Although the prime minister of Israel is an intelligent man he along with all others in the Israeli government is ignorant concerning Christ
According to the prophecies in the Bible, the reformed nation of Israel will suffer many tests and endure a great deal of discipline
Whether or not Israel will retain the Golan Heights or the Sinai does not depend upon the decisions of presidents and diplomats
The Lord will test and discipline Israel and at the same time extend His secret and sovereign love to them because He needs them
Whose need is greater does the nation of Israel need the Lord Jesus more than the Lord Jesus needs the nation of Israel?
Just as Joseph's brothers were ignorant of his love , so the nation of Israel today is ignorant of Christ's love for them
About twenty-two years after his dreams, Joseph saw them fulfilled, but not until he had been betrayed and imprisoned
You may be successful in restraining your excitement, but it is virtually impossible for anyone not to expose his glory
Not until our self and our natural man have been thoroughly dealt with can we keep from revealing our glory to others
He was full of human feelings and sentiments, but he kept himself with all his feelings under the rulership of the Spirit
We all, especially the young people, need such a life and such a way that is the reigning aspect of a mature person
Thinking that Joseph was not able to understand them, they even spoke in Joseph's presence about what they had done to him
At first Joseph thought that one brother should be sent to bring the youngest brother and that all the rest should remain in prison
As a type of Christ, Joseph did the same thing to his brothers that Christ will do to the nation of Israel in the future
Because Joseph's brothers did not understand his wise dealing with them, they were frightened by his secret love
Verse 28 says, 'And their heart went out, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us'?
Rather, for their sake he was willing to sacrifice the enjoyment of the fulfillment of his dreams for a period of time
Even in ancient times it would not have taken more than a few weeks for them to return home and to come back with their father
Joseph's sacrifice of this enjoyment caused him to delay the enjoyment of the fulfillment of his dreams for at least another six months
If we do not have such a life, we shall contact people according to our feelings, according to whether we are happy or sad
If he had acted according to his desire to see his father, he would have had his father brought to him immediately
As we have seen, he loved them in a secret way by restoring their money and by affording them sufficient provision for their journey
The point here is that we should not deal with others according to our temperament, sentiment, or natural being
How could you claim that a certain man is not your husband if you have been living with him for the past several years?
It is not only difficult for us to remain together, but it is hard for a man to stay with his wife for a long period of time
Although we have no divorces in our married life, in the church life sometimes the leading ones do not contact others in a proper way
If they do this, they will contact the saints according to their needs and not according to their own sentiments
Even in the matter of the fulfillment of his dreams he ignored his feelings and took care of his brothers and of what would be good for them
Just as Joseph's brothers were forced to turn to him again, so the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ
According to the Bible, the house of Israel will return to Christ at the end of this age and recognize Jesus of Nazareth as their Messiah
Before the reformation of the nation of Israel, the Jews were scattered, and people paid little attention to them
Israel is condemned by other countries because she has possession of the Golan Heights and the land west of the Jordan River
Unless Israel is forced to turn to Him out of their need to maintain their existence, they will never turn to Christ
He did not allow his excitement at seeing his brothers or his desire to see his father to cause him to act foolishly
Rather, he was wise and calm, disciplining his brothers at the sacrifice of fulfilling his desire to see his father
They knew that one day it would be exhausted and that they would have to return to Egypt and face that man again
All the way to Egypt they might have been saying to one another, 'What shall we do with that man who put Simeon into prison?
Although they did not recognize him, he wanted to indicate to them that he was intimate with them, even as he was testing them
In 43:1-15 Joseph's brothers were still learning their lesson, and in 43:16-34 Joseph still left them under his test
They told the steward that the last time they had purchased grain they had paid the money, but the money had been placed in their sacks
The steward said, 'Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks'
No matter how much Joseph had disguised himself, there must have been some sign of affection in the way he asked about his father
There must have been particular features in Joseph's countenance that they could have recognized, even after twenty-two years
They should have remembered that Joseph was taken to Egypt, and they should have realized that this man was Joseph
Verse 34 says, 'And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs'
There must have been a purpose in Joseph's giving Benjamin a portion five times greater than that of the other brothers
His intention must have been to indicate to his brothers that he was Joseph and that he loved his younger brother
The Lord may be directly in front of us and He may have done a great deal for us, but we cannot recognize Him or what He has done
When we came to Christ and then into the church life, we might have wondered about our money, our security, or our family
They kept their eyes on their money and might have said to one another, 'Don't you realize this is a lot of money?
There are a few who recognize the indications of the Lord's deeds and realize that what happened to them was of the Lord
We would do the same thing if we had evil thoughts towards someone who, with a good intention, invited us to his home for dinner
Joseph's brothers should have recognized that here was an Egyptian eating in the Hebrew way, a way that was abominable to the Egyptians
If you had been one of Joseph's brothers bowing down to him, you might have said, 'This might be Joseph, the master of dreams'
Although Joseph's brothers had heard about the dream and were in the fulfillment of the dream, they did not recognize Joseph
Even after Joseph's brothers had been dealt with so much, they still did not realize that they were meeting with Joseph
As we shall see in another message, their ignorance eventually forced Joseph to be patient no longer, but to reveal himself to them
Now we recognize Joseph and understand that everything He does is with the intention of helping us to know Him
The prophecies in the Bible say that Christ will test the ignorant children of Israel, but they do not give the details
If we keep all these points in mind as we follow the news in the Middle East, we shall be happy and praise the Lord
Because his brothers were so blind and ignorant of him, Joseph was compelled to take a further step to reveal himself to them
The lessons were not completed until at least one among them had improved and had learned to care for his father and youngest brother
Suddenly, much to their surprise, the steward caught up with them and said, 'Wherefore have ye repaid evil for good'?
Although your intention may be very good, you may cause damage to others if you are governed by your good intention
In the story of Joseph's revealing himself to his brothers we do not see any display of childishness on his part
Instead of being manipulated by his intention or desire, he was completely under the control of his wisdom and directed by his patience
Because we are not as mature as Joseph, we may think that he was too severe and troublesome in dealing with his brothers
His acknowledgment of them was not directed by his desire or his feelings; it was completely under the direction of God's wisdom
When Judah spoke to him like this, Joseph still did not reveal himself to them, but continued to be patient, testing Judah to the uttermost
Since he was so emotional, how could he have refrained from expressing his emotion for at least several months?
In chapter forty-five, after the brothers had passed through the dealings and had learned their lessons, Joseph wept
Reuben or Levi might have said, 'Throughout our entire life we were never disciplined as much as we were in these last months'
When his emotion was about to burst forth at seeing Benjamin, he turned aside to weep privately and to wash his face
If you are about to lose your temper at home, you should go to the rest room, let out your feelings privately, and then wash your face
When some hear this, they may say, 'Brother Lee, didn't you say that the resurrection life within us is able to overcome everything?
In Joseph's life his temper, disposition, emotion, intention, and desire were all under the control of God's leading
Realizing that God had sovereignly sent him to Egypt to fulfill His purpose, he spontaneously received his brothers
Instead of feeling that we have been offended, we shall realize that everything that has happened to us was according to God's sovereignty
Everything under God's sovereignty is for our good, for the fulfillment of His purpose, and for the edification of others
If we bring these matters regarding Joseph into our prayer and fellowship, we shall see more and we shall be nourished
As we have pointed out many times, the book of Genesis contains the seeds of nearly all the truths in the Scriptures
When all the tests were over and the time was ripe, Joseph revealed himself and his exaltation and glory to his brothers
When Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, they no doubt were shocked to see him and to remember what they had done to him
At exactly the right time, Christ will reveal that He has been exalted and that no one in the universe is higher than He
According to Zechariah 141619 the Egyptians and those from the other nations will be required to present offerings to the Lord in Jerusalem
The first book of the New Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, reveals Christ on the one hand and the kingdom of God on the other hand
In the closing chapters of Genesis, Christ is typified by Joseph, and the kingdom is foreshadowed by the house of Israel
The desire of Joseph's heart was that his brothers would be a people living together as God's testimony on earth
When Joseph forgave his brothers, he comforted them and told them not to be angry with themselves, but to forget what they had done to him
Joseph had a thorough realization of this and thus he could forgive his brothers for the way they mistreated him
Joseph's realization that God was the One who had sent him to Egypt is a seed of the truth found in Romans 8:28
Because Joseph was the favorite of his father Jacob, he lived in a pleasant environment, and there was no way for him to suffer anything
One day, according to the Lord's sovereignty, Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers, and they sold him into slavery
In order for this vision to be fulfilled, Joseph had to undergo a great deal of suffering, especially at the hands of those closest to him
God had sent Joseph to Egypt to preserve life so that a remnant might remain for the fulfillment of His purpose
Although he had been enthroned to be the ruler of the earth, he nevertheless did nothing for himself or for his own enjoyment
Of initiating the contact with his father himself, he remained continually under God's sovereignty, praying, 'Lord, You do it
He was a self-denying person who had no self-interest, self-enjoyment, self-feeling, self-ambition, or self-goal
God sovereignly prepared the environment to indicate that the time was right for Joseph to send for his father
Joseph did not leave Egypt to see his father; neither did he send someone to find out whether or not a caravan was coming
Jacob seemed to be saying to Judah, 'Judah, go to Joseph and tell him that I'm coming and ask him to direct us to him'
When he heard that his father had arrived in Goshen he presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
If we are under the rulership of the Spirit, we shall ask the Lord to have mercy on us when we sense that we are about to lose our temper
If he had acted according to his feelings and not according to God's guidance, everything would have been spoiled
In order for the kingdom to be realized in a practical way, there had to be a person who lived under restriction and who denied himself
In such a case it would have been impossible for the kingdom of God to be brought in and realized in a practical way
Joseph's self-denial, his restriction under God's sovereign hand, was the key to the practice of the kingdom life
Joseph had the power and the position to do something about his situation, but he did not do what he had the power to do
Perhaps as he prayed to the Lord regarding the possibility of visiting his father, the Lord instructed him to do nothing about it
By means of his prayer Joseph might have been confirmed in believing that his dreams were of God and that God Himself would fulfill them
Even when the time was right for his father to come to him in Egypt, Joseph did not go out to meet him on the way
You are qualified and empowered to do everything necessary to fulfill your desire, yet you refrain from doing so
The strongest person is not the one who is able to do something, but the one who is able not to do what he has the power to do
As we shall see in the next message, the kingdom life came in through Joseph's ability not to do what he had the power to do
Often He had the position, the power, and the right environment to do many things, but he also had the power not to do those things
As we have pointed out a number of times, in the story of Joseph there are two lines: the line of the type and the line of life
Before we consider further the line of life, we need to see another point regarding Joseph as a type of Christ
If we take note of the prophecy in the story of Joseph we shall see that his record is a picture of Christs reign in the millennial kingdom
When Christ is reigning during the coming thousand years, He will meet everyone's need and satisfy everyone's hunger
If you examine the prophecies regarding Christ's reign in the millennium, you will see that Christ will make everything living
As He reigns in the millennium, Christ will not only afford people food to satisfy them, but supply them with seed to make them productive
There will be many nations on earth during the millennium, but only one nation, Israel, will be God's testimony
Before we see what the people had to do, we need to point out the reason Joseph became so rich and had the life supply
Even after he had been enthroned and was in power, he was still suffering because he was separated from his father
As we pointed out in the previous message, he had the power and the position to do everything necessary to have his father brought to him
Not by gain our life is measured, But by what we've lost 'tis scored; 'Tis not how much wine is drunken, But how much has been outpoured
For the strength of love e'er standeth In the sacrifice we bear; He who has the greatest suff'ring Ever has the most to share
He who treats himself severely Is the best for God to gain; He who hurts himself most dearly Most can comfort those in pain
He who suffering never beareth Is but empty 'sounding brass'; He who self life never spareth Has the joys which all surpass
Because the grapevine undergoes many sufferings, dealings, cuttings, and breakings, it produces rich wine to cheer man
On the one hand, Joseph was laboring; on the other hand, he was suffering because he was separated from his father
During these seven years he did not care for himself, but made arrangements for others to be taken care of in the future
Again and again, Brother Nee stressed that we must take care of our physical life so that we shall not die at an early age
Because of this, Brother Nee charged the trainees to take care of themselves and not to commit gradual suicide
If anyone in the church life is willing to give away the life supply in a cheap way, we must question whether the supply he has is genuine
The people who came to Joseph for food paid four kinds of prices: their money, their cattle, their land, and themselves
Some are not willing to pay the price for the supply because they are concerned about losing their conveniences
Joseph's brothers were concerned about their donkeys, worried that Joseph would find some excuse to take them away
The Lord Jesus in His recovery 'robs' us of everything of our convenience, our means of livelihood, and our resources
Why are there still so many opinions, and why is there so little oneness and building in today's Christianity?
Although you have heard many messages on consecration, you have probably not heard a message on handing yourself over to the Lord
Some of us were burdened that his ministry be resumed, and we did our best to bring this about, but we could do nothing to help the matter
Before his ministry had been recovered, some of us had arranged to meet with him in his home for a time of fellowship
For at least six years he had not spoken a public word in that district, although a few had contact with him privately
Brother Nee replied, 'If you intend to practice this way, you must hand over in writing yourself and everything you possess'
Joseph moved the people to cities 'from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof' in order to have an even distribution
If we make the fourth payment, we shall receive not only the food to satisfy ourselves, but also the seed to produce something for others
After he was enthroned and the people came to him for food, Egypt became a prefigure of the millennium with all the people on the same level
According to Hebrews 11, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all received the promise of the good land, but died without inheriting it
Jacob realized that death to him was a time of sleeping and that on the day of resurrection he would rise up to inherit the good land
As for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive'
As he was dying, he charged the children of Israel not to leave his bones in Egypt, but to bring them into the promised land
He believed that one day he would rise up to inherit the good land and participate in all the enjoyment that would be there
In the beginning of this book, God created man in His image to express Him, and He gave man His dominion to represent Him
In brief, as a whole, the book of Genesis begins with God's creation and ends with man's death and his being put in a coffin, even in Egypt
