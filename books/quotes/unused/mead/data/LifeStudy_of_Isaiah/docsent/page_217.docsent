   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH As Typified by Cyrus the King of Persia,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Israel, and by Isaiah the Prophet Scripture Reading: Isa 41:2, 25; 45:13, 1; 48:14b; 46:11b; 44:28; 41:8-16; 42:1a; 43:10; 44:1-5, 21; 49:3; 46:13b; 48:16b; 49:1-4; 50:4-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah typified by three persons first, by a Gentile king, Cyrus the king of Persia; second, by God's selected corporate people, Israel; and third, by a typical, bonafide, top prophet of Jehovah, Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All three were God's servants in the sense of a type.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Christ is so great, many types are needed to describe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Old Testament is full of types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, the four Gospels portray Christ in four aspects, but He has many, many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Isaiah we can see many aspects of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah was a wonderful, poetic writer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His writing is long.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have pointed out previously that the sections of Isaiah are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah symbolize all the significances in the contents of the Old Testament, which is composed of thirty-nine books.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament may be considered as the element, and the first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah are the essence extracted from this element.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah are the second section of this book, and they correspond to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This section of twenty-seven chapters can be considered as the essence of the New Testament, the extract of the real significance of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This extract is concerning one person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we call Him the Lord Jesus Christ, which equals the Lord Jehovah in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jehovah is the Old Testament Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the New Testament Lord Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first chapter of the second section of Isaiah is chapter forty, where Christ is revealed as Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter what is covered is the revealing of the Lord Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revealing means manifesting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a person is hidden, concealed, and covered, we cannot see him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When his covering is removed, he is revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means He is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The revealing is the manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapter forty covers the revealing of the Lord Jehovah, which is the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this chapter Isaiah declares, "Here is your God!" v. 9 . The revealing of the Lord Jehovah is the appearing of the very God, and this Lord Jehovah, the very God, is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jehovah, the Lord God, appears as the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior.</S>
