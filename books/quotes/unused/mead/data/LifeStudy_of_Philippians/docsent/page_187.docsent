   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACCEPTING THE LORD S WILL Experiencing His Sufficient Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that to overcome anxiety we need to pray and have fellowship with the Lord and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then with thanksgiving we need to make our petitions known.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we do this, we may think that the Lord will always answer us and give us what we ask.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, sometimes the Lord will say no. Consider Paul s experience of the thorn in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2 Corinthians 12:8 he says, For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Lord denied Paul s request, and said to him, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness v. 9 . Therefore, Paul could declare, Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crucial point here is that Paul accepted the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He realized that God s will was to leave the thorn with him so that he could experience His sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because Paul accepted the Lord s will, he did not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, we need to pray and petition the Lord with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when the Lord does not grant our petition, our anxiety may increase instead of decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At such a time, we realize that the Lord will not change our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, He allows the thorn to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knows that we need the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also needs it that He may reveal His sufficient grace and in addition train us to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not accept the Lord s will but insist on making petitions according to our own will, we shall not be able to escape anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose you pray to the Lord when you are suffering from a certain illness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord may answer your prayer and heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does this especially on behalf of those who are rather young in their experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At a later time, however, you may again become sick and ask the Lord to heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of healing you suddenly, He may heal you gradually, or He may not heal you at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, it may become clear to you that the Lord intends for the illness to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you accept His will in the matter, you will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Brother Nee was a young man, he suffered from heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often when he ministered the Word he was in such pain that he had to lean on a stand for support.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although he contracted this disease before he was thirty years of age, he lived with that illness for nearly forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although he knew that he could die from that disease at any time, he accepted the Lord s will and was not anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He realized that his illness was a thorn given him for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Trusting the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Accepting the Lord s will in particular matters not only enables us to experience His sufficient grace; it also teaches us to have a life of trusting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the thorn had been taken away from Paul, Paul probably would not have trusted in the Lord as much as he did with the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply because the thorn was allowed to remain, day by day Paul had to live a life of trusting in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all prefer that hardships and sufferings be taken away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But sometimes the Lord will say, No, I cannot answer your request.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is better for this thing to remain so that you may learn to trust Me and not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we accept the Lord s will and trust Him, we shall not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we do not accept His will or if we do not live by trusting in Him, we shall be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to my natural life, I am the kind of person who likes everything to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I become ill in some way, my desire is to be healed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if there is something wrong with an article of clothing, I want it fixed and made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I want everything under my management to be right in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I cannot control whether or not sickness comes to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord may assign illness to me, realizing that I need it so that I may learn to trust Him and not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this I need to say, Lord, I thank You that this sickness is a help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I also thank You, Lord, that even this fulfills Your purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we thank the Lord in this way, the more we shall have forbearance in place of anxiety.</S>
