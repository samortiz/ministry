   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>L. Doing Well by Giving</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One s Virginity in Marriage,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Doing Better by Deciding</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Keep One s Virginity</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 37 and 38 Paul says, But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority over his own will and has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virginity, he will do well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So then both he who gives his own virginity in marriage does well, and he who does not give it in marriage will do better.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verses 36 through 38 virgin refers both to male and female, as in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to verse 36, there is nothing wrong, if need requires, for one to give his virginity in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 36 through 38 have also been translated as follows: But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the bloom of youth and need so requires, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority over his own will and has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most translators prefer this translation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But according to the expressions in these verses and the context of the chapter, especially verses 25 through 28, the translation in the Recovery Version is more logical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John Nelson Darby in his New Translation of the Bible takes this view.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If need requires, a virgin, male or female, may give oneself to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to do well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, to keep one s virginity is to do better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul s word indicates that it is better to remain unmarried.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we must remember that this depends upon the gift each one has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>M. After the Death of Her Husband</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>a Wife Being Free to Be Married</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only to One in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning remarriage, Paul says in verse 39, A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives; but if the husband should sleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After her husband dies, a wife is free to be married to another, only in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is another basic principle concerning married life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By setting forth all these principles, Paul answered the questions concerning marriage raised by the philosophical believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The answers to the various questions are found in the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, it is profitable for us to study these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will answer many of our questions about marriage.</S>
