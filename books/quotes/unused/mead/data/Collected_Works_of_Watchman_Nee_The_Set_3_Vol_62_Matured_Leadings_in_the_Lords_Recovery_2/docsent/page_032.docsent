   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEMAND OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE SUPPLY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may say that a person as demanding as Christ is too hard to approach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But once we answer His demand, we will feel refreshed and happy within.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we feel that Christ has a demand within us and we answer this demand, we will feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He demands, He also supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only such ones can testify of and share Christ's riches, transcendence, and excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Christian life should be like a piano; the important thing is not how it looks outwardly but whether or not it plays the right tune.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not saying this to encourage you to be loose in the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that more brothers and sisters can be raised up to touch Christ's inward demands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some brothers and sisters have heard messages concerning consecration and the handing over of one's all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may have witnessed the burning consecration and handing over of the other brothers and sisters, and they may have decided to follow suit and do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is not enough for them to be zealous, to consecrate themselves, and to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their consecration and handing over must issue from a genuine demand within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Handing over enables us to become sensitive to the Lord's demands; it also enables us to enjoy the precious Lord in a richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we meet the Lord's demand in an absolute way, we will find His demands easy and light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we only partially answer it, we will find it hard to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is very difficult to answer sixty or seventy percent of the Lord's call.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is easy to answer one hundred percent of His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man does not answer His call, he will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he answers His call only halfway, he will be even less happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he answers His call reluctantly, he will find himself struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only those who lay everything on the altar receive the most abundant joy and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we should only worry about not answering His call enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is hard for a Christian to go on if he drags his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May we be clear that the Christian pathway today has everything to do with Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should follow Christ; we should answer His demand within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me repeat: We judge our Christian life by the sense of strength, sweetness, comfort, clarity, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ALL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TO ANSWER THE LORD'S DEMAND</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Watchman Nee: Today we can find two kinds of brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many brothers and sisters are happy, but a few are sad.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps you can find both kinds of Christians sitting right beside you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I were to ask you to nominate the happiest people here, the ones who have no problems would surely say that they are the ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If anyone is not happy and if anyone has doubts about himself, surely he must have some kind of problem, some kind of spiritual sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The main reason for this sickness is that the Lord has a demand that has not been answered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a matter of experience; it is not a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you say, "Before you two brothers spoke, I was quite happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now your speaking has taken away my happiness," this is because our message conveys the demand of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a Christian does not answer this demand, he will be sad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our doctrine, speaking, and exhortation do not serve the basic need.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our voice is like the sound from the loudspeakers; we only amplify the demand of Christ within and make it clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE WAY TODAY BEING TO OBEY THE INNER VOICE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the brothers and sisters hear this voice but are reluctant to answer the Lord's call, then I can only say that it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not want to be a Christian, it is better that you never started.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today the life of Christ is in you; it is impossible for you to no longer be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since you are a Christian, you should resolve within to follow the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why can you not answer the call of the Lord's great love?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For many years, you have quenched, suppressed, and limited the inner voice with money, the world, and worries.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>None of our teachings are new doctrines in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are merely telling you what you should be hearing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not speaking fresh words here, and we have no interest to speak anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are telling you the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more things a Christian holds in his hand, the more he suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the end he will be like the young ruler, going away in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you forsake everything, however, you will rejoice like Zaccheus and experience salvation Luke 18:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If an unbeliever is brought here and hears such a word, he will surely go away, saying, "These speakers must have something wrong in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How can they ask anyone to give up everything?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When unbelievers hear such a word, they will not be pricked; some may even consider our words to be a kind of joke.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only those who truly have Christ in them as life will know the meaning of our word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be a Christian, we have to be one in such a reckless way; we have to take such a reckless pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see the Christian pathway now.</S>
