   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MIXTURE IN WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is important for us to see that the worship of the golden calf in Exodus 32 was a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was an idol that was worshipped, but it was worshipped in the way that God s people were supposed to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a common practice among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christians may worship in the way that is suitable to the worship of God, but actually the object of their worship may be something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have a clear, heavenly view, we shall realize that much of the worship among Christians today is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Something that pretends to be God is worshipped as if it were actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Aaron made the golden calf, the people said, This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt Exo 32:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people worshipped the golden calf as if it were the very God who had brought them out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Was that not a mixture?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, 32:5 and 6 say, And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, A feast to Jehovah tomorrow!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that an altar was built before the idol, and the people offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that they worshipped the idol in the way that they were supposed to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was utterly a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, that worship was not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can compare the worship among Christians today with that of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The worship of the golden calf by the children of Israel is a picture of the impure worship among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The worship of the golden calf was different from the pagan worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The golden calf was worshipped by a redeemed people in the name of the Lord their Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the golden calf was made, the people declared that it was the Lord who had brought them out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that they worshipped an idol in the name of Jehovah their God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, they worshipped that idol in the way they should have worshipped God, that is, in the way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They offered to the idol the kind of offerings that they should have offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a shameful mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People would easily condemn the pagan worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in its present-day expression it is not easy for anyone to condemn the kind of impure worship we see in Exodus 32, a worship that is full of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you have the assurance that the so-called worship services that take place in today s cathedrals and chapels are a pure worship of God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is it really God who is being worshipped?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God is not the One who is being worshipped, then who is the object of worship?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the worship is not purely the worship of God, it must be the worship of something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Holy songs may be sung to God and prayers may be offered to God, but actually the worship is to someone or something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NOT USING GOD S GIFTS FOR GOD S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us go on to see what is the principle of this kind of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle of the golden-calf idol is that wealth and treasures gifts from God, both material and spiritual are not properly used for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be careful regarding both material things and spiritual gifts received from God, for we may not use these gifts properly for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, suppose you have the ability to teach the Bible, and you use this ability to establish a work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your ability to teach the Bible is a gift from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But do you use that gift properly for God s purpose, or do you use it to build up something other than God s purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are doing the latter, you are making a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not an extreme statement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that one day, either in this age or in the next, we all shall realize that, in principle, this is the making of a golden calf and is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many golden calves have been made by today s Aarons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those with the gift of gospel preaching may also use this ability to make a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A certain brother may be an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has truly given him the gift of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this brother needs to ask himself what is his purpose in exercising this gift.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is his purpose pure?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is it genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These questions deserve serious consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to examine ourselves and ask what we are doing and what is our purpose for doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With Christian workers who are gifted, no temptation is greater than the work itself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The work we are doing is itself the biggest temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you study the history of the church and the biographies of different preachers and evangelists, you will see that many have built idols.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some even fashioned themselves into an idol; that is, they themselves became an idol, a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is according to the principle of the golden-calf idol, the principle of not properly using for God s purpose the gifts received from God.</S>
