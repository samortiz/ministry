   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SON EXPRESSING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second significance of a son in the Bible is that a son expresses the father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, the Son of God is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 14:9 the Lord Jesus said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son does the Father's will 6:38 and speaks the Father's word 12:49-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the Son's word is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Son speaks, the Father does His work 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Son's life is for the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A basic concept in the Bible is that the invisible God desires a visible expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the reason God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the visible expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Compare the sons of man sitting in a theater with the sons of God sitting in a church meeting, and see what a difference there is in the expression on their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are here not to express Americans or Chinese, but God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice that we do not express God the Creator, but we express God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 1:3 and 4 indicate that God the Father, not God the Creator, has chosen us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to do the will of our heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To do His will is to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we do the will of our earthly father, what we do is an expression of his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, when we do the will of the heavenly Father, we express His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, as sons of God, we have the divine life for the purpose of expressing the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a shame it is to express our nationality, culture, or anything that is not our Father!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we are sons of the Father, others should be able to see the Father expressed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason we love each other is that we are brothers born of the same Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I see the Father in you, and you see the Father in me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Father is the source not only of our life but also of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is this kind of life and expression that constitutes us into that organism known as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BODY FUNCTIONING BY THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This brings us to the significance of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the New Testament, the Body is for function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you read Ephesians 4, Romans 12, and 1 Corinthians 12, you will see that in these chapters the Body is for function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to function, however, we must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is no life in our body, the body cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The body functions with life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life by which the Body functions is the life of the sons of God, the divine life for the divine expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Throughout the years, we have spoken a great deal about function, but we have not pointed out that our function must be by the life of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is possible to function in the church life by the life of the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times we have functioned by the wrong life, not by the life of the sons of God but by the life of the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This may be true, for example, in the arranging of chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we arrange chairs, we may function by the life of a son of man or by the life of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The content of the life of the son of man is self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is I, me, my, and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we function by this life, we may say, "Every Sunday morning I arrange the chairs myself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, no one else helps me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I use my time and energy to do this alone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But look at the good job I have done!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every chair is exactly in place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever I do something, I do it thoroughly."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the life of the son of man, a son of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, it is also possible to arrange chairs by the life of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In such a case, it is not I but Christ who arranges the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In all that we do, we need to live by the life of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If not, we cannot be the Body of Christ because the Body functions by the life of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this life of the sons of God, there is no self.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this life Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first life, the life of the sons of man, does not produce the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, it produces only the self.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the second life, the life of the sons of God, that constitutes the Body of Christ, because Christ is the content of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In fact, this life is nothing but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, for the proper Body life, we need the proper sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to be sons of God.</S>
