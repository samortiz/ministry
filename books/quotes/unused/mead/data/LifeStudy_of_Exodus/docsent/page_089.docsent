   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HAVING PLUNDERED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE EGYPTIANS OF THEIR</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>SILVER, GOLD, AND RAIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exodus 12:35 and 36 say, And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave to them what they asked.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And they plundered the Egyptians Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the children of Israel had no time to prepare leavened bread, they did have time to plunder the Egyptians of their silver, gold, and raiment 3:21-22; 11:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that in God s salvation He desires that we plunder the world of its wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s economy is different from man s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, Buddhism teaches that we should take nothing out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God, on the contrary, commanded His chosen people to ask the Egyptians for silver, gold, and raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, His people plundered the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was not robbery; it was a belated payment for a long period of slave labor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God in His righteousness arranged for the Egyptians to pay the children of Israel for their labor in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many saved ones can testify that God s strong hand has worked in their environment to give them the opportunity to plunder the world of its wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s goal in doing this is not the enrichment of His people; it is the building of the tabernacle, His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children of Israel needed the gold, silver, and raiment for the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the sake of God s dwelling place, we should not leave the world as the Buddhists do; we should plunder Egypt of wealth to be used in building the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, when Peter and John were asked for money by the beggar, they had no silver or gold to give him Acts 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But on the other hand, they were among those who had plundered the world of its wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we, the chosen people of God, come out of the world under God s sovereign hand, we have no time to leaven anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we do have the opportunity to plunder the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All those who are raised up by the Lord are those who plunder the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the Lord s purpose, they bring certain riches out of the world and present them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For instance, Paul could say, As poor yet enriching many, as having nothing and possessing all things 2 Cor 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This matter of plundering the wealth of the Egyptians can be illustrated and confirmed by the experiences of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apparently, it was unjust for the children of Israel to plunder the Egyptians of their gold, silver, and raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out, by plundering the wealth of Egypt, they were actually receiving righteous payment for their forced labor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense, the pay they deserved for their labor had been deposited over the years in the bank in Egypt and then was withdrawn at the time of the exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, God s people did not take the gold, silver, and raiment for their own use or purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, the riches of Egypt were used through God s chosen people for the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tabernacle was the testimony of God, which typifies Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church today is God s tabernacle constituted of Christ and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a testimony is built with the offerings of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the riches of the Egyptians came through the labor of God s people and were spent for God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what it means to plunder the world of its wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The saints in the Lord s recovery should not be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should get a good education and then work diligently at a proper job to earn an adequate living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the money they earn should not be used only for themselves or for their enjoyment; it should be used for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, we must labor in the world and receive just payment for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But on the other hand, what we earn should be used for the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we work in the world, we do not work for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, we work in the world for something that is not of the world, just as the children of Israel labored in Egypt for something that was not of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Pharaoh forced God s people to work as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, they received for their labor the riches of Egypt that were used for the building of the tabernacle, God s testimony, not for Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some may think that because we labor diligently in the world we labor for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, our labor is for God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we receive for our labor in the world is given to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the promise in the New Testament, the more we give to the Lord, the more He will give to us Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord intends to plunder the world of its wealth through our labor so that we may give this wealth to Him for the building up of His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The experience of a certain brother in England illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Early in his Christian life, he gave ten percent of his income to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because he was faithful in this matter, the Lord caused him to prosper financially.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brother then increased the percentage of his giving from ten percent to fifteen percent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord caused him to prosper even more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As the years went by, this brother gradually increased the percentage of his giving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But no matter how much he gave to the Lord, the Lord always gave even more to him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This brother surely was one who plundered the riches of the world and presented them to the Lord for His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another illustration is found in the experience of some brothers in the Lord who opened a tailor shop with the intention of helping the Lord s people and the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually their business expanded so that they had a hundred chain stores.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the profit they earned from this business went to support the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They also plundered the world for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All those who realize what it means to come out of the world will work diligently not for their own welfare, but for the Lord s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The building of the meeting hall in Anaheim also illustrates this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A great deal of volunteer labor went into the construction of this facility.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This labor saved a very large amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who worked on the hall plundered the world through their labors.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I believe that the Lord has made a record of their faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Throughout the years, many of the saints who have been faithful to the Lord have been enriched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, the crucial matter is what use the saints make of this material increase.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If this financial gain is used for the world, this will be a great failure in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if it is used for God s testimony, it will be another case of plundering the wealth of the world under the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To plunder the world is not to take anything from the world unrighteously: it is to labor in the world and to use the gain from our labor for God s testimony.</S>
