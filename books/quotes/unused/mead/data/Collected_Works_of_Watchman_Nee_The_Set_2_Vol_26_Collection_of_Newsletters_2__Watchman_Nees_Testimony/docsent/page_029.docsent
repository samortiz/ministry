   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>11 February 1935 THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING IN SINGAPORE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A HEART-RENDING LETTER ABOUT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>LEAVING THE DENOMINATIONS, RETURNING TO THEM, AND LEAVING THEM ONCE AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To our brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We received your answering letter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We separated from the Brethren about four months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank the Lord that He Himself led us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We felt quite awhile ago that the Brethren were a denomination in a different form because they have much of the color of the denominations that is contradictory to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time we wanted to move carefully, so we prayed earnestly before the Lord and waited patiently for about three years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we suspected they were a denomination very early on, we never heard of any precedent of leaving the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, we also heard brothers in other localities say that the Brethren were not a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason we were forced to go before God to consider our doubts carefully because we were afraid that separating from them would be a careless move which would divide the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we patiently waited for the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord's time came, we could not but obey God and separate ourselves from them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We never thought that we would first leave a denomination, only to enter another by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We really feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every time we think of it, we break out in a sweat!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second time we left the denominations, the circumstances were even more difficult to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other party does not understand our faith and suspects that we have entered into a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the Lord gave us an opportunity to testify of the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We did not separate from them over different interpretations of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We separated because we have clearly seen that Christ is the center of our meetings; the truth is not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We discovered that the Brethren have two points of error: 1 They do not allow Christ to be the Head in everything, and 2 they have the regulations of man's will and an invisible organization everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We thank the Lord that in this experience He showed us what to be careful about.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our flesh is not dealt with by the cross severely, we may also become a different form of denomination!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A study of the history of the Brethren shows that they began when many Western brothers left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They too announced that the denominations were not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unfortunately, they became an invisible denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We confess that the Brethren Church is the best denomination among denominations, but our question is not what kind of denomination it is but whether or not it is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a meeting has been stained with any color of the denominations, it is an abomination to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should separate ourselves from it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord, although there are not many people meeting in the Lord's name in Singapore 56 Hsiao P'o Hu Lau Lueh Sha Lu, Singapore , the Lord is to be praised because His light shines on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord Himself lead us from now on so that we do not go astray by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our present need is the prayers of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace in the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your little brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wang K'ai Sen, Chang Chia Chi, Tseng K'ai Hao</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I also hope you will pray even more for the work so that the believers may be perfected and sinners may be saved and added to the Lord's church daily.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that Brother Watchman can come for a visit and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please pray for this so that the Lord's will may be done.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The time is pressing; the Lord is coming quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The fiercer the battle, the greater the tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should be watchful and pray, endure, and be bold to be overcomers waiting to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Greetings to Brothers Watchman, Kuang Jung, Shou Ling, and Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Your brother,</S>
