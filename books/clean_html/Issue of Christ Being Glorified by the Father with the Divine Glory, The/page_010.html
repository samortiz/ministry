<P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for the meeting tonight. You know, Lord, we are coming to a matter in Your holy Word which is most mysterious. We surely need You. Without You as the unveiling Spirit, we cannot see this matter. Lord, we trust in You for speaking, for listening, and for understanding. Defeat Your enemy, who for two thousand years has been deceiving Your people regarding this matter. Amen.</P><P>In considering the issue of Christ's glorification, we will use a very particular word&#151;incorporation. This word is often used in business, but according to my knowledge it has not previously been used in interpreting the holy Word. In this message we need to see that the issue of Christ's glorification is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>The issue of Christ's glorification is an incorporation. An incorporation usually involves a number of parties. What God plans to do in His economy is to incorporate all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people with Himself as the consummated God into a great incorporation.</P><P>The Gospel of John, a book in which this incorporation is fully unveiled, is composed of three sections. John 1:1 through 12:16 is the first section. Although 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified," glorification is not covered in this section. The second section, which begins with 12:17 and ends at 17:26, is concerned with Christ's glorification. The issue, the outcome, of this glorification is an incorporation, which is revealed in chapter fourteen. The third section, chapters eighteen through twenty-one, covers Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.</P><P>Chapter twelve unveils Christ's glorification in a particular way. The Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat (v.24), and His intrinsic content&#151;the glory of His divinity&#151;was concealed within the shell of His flesh. As the unique grain of wheat He needed to be put into death so that His intrinsic content could be released. The issue of this release, this glorification, was the producing of a universal incorporation. This incorporation is revealed in a full and detailed way in chapter fourteen. This means that the incorporation revealed in chapter fourteen is the issue of the glorification unveiled in chapter twelve. If we see this, we will realize that we cannot know chapter fourteen without understanding the glorification in chapter twelve.</P><P>The main point in chapter fourteen of John is incorporation. In verses 20 and 17 the word in is used four times. These four ins are the base for our understanding of the universal incorporation of the consummated Triune God with the regenerated believers.</P>
