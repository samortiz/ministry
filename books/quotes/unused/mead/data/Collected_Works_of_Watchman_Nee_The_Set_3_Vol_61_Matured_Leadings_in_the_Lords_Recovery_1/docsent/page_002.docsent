   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Volumes 61 and 62 of The Collected Works only include the record of the meetings in which Watchman Nee attended and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning this period of time, Brother K. H. Weigh remarked, "In the past it had been a rare occurrence for these two brothers to visit the same church at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their ministry issued in a great revival in the church in Hong Kong.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The content of these meetings includes handing over oneself for the preaching of the gospel, release from the bondage of money, the whole Body rising up to serve, spiritual ministry, and arrangements concerning various aspects of church service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every chapter is weighty in content and fresh in revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the messages in these two volumes were released at a time when Watchman Nee's ministry was in its mature stage, we have named these two volumes "Mature Leadings in the Lord's Recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They form the final volumes in this series of The Collected Works of Watchman Nee.</S>
