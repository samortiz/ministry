   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING THE WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FLOWING FROM THE CLEFT ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although you may not realize it, 1 and 2 Corinthians are the continuation of Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians speaks of Christ and the rock, and 2 Corinthians mentions the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asks, Is Christ divided? and in 12:12 he says, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. First Corinthians 10:4 speaks of the rock: And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This cleft rock out of which water flows is the very foundation mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:11, where Paul says, For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we put these points together, we shall see how to be built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Matthew 16, to be built upon this rock is to see the Person, to receive the revelation, and to make the declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This, however, is the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to see further that this rock is the cleft rock out of which living water is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rock being cleft signifies Christ crucified, and the flowing of living water signifies Christ flowing through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The river flowing out of the rock is designated in 1 Corinthians 15:45 as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the life-giving Spirit is the water flowing out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The crucified Christ is now flowing out the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>. We all have been positioned to drink of this flowing water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we continue to be built upon this rock by drinking the water flowing out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BEING BUILT BY DRINKING AND REMAINING ATTACHED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we have seen, 2 Corinthians 1:21 says that we have been attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the continuation of the building unveiled in Matthew 16 is in the drinking and the attaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Day by day we are drinking the water flowing out of the cleft rock, and we are also being attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot be built unless we drink the living water and remain attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By drinking we receive the water, and by being attached we are under the anointing of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By drinking we receive more life, and by being attached we receive more oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the water within and the oil without we daily grow and are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the practical building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot be built with others or build others up by our own endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, we need to drink and remain attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to see a vision of the Person of Christ and then declare what we see, saying, Amen, this is Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we must go on to drink of the cleft rock in resurrection and to be attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, we shall be filled with water within and covered with oil without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE LIFE AND THE OINTMENT FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s great prophecy in Matthew 16:18 has not yet been fulfilled because most Christians are veiled and do not see that Christ today is the ointment and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may know certain terms, but they do not have the revelation or the declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By making a declaration we testify that we have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen that Jesus, a wonderful Person, is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the very embodiment of God, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, He is life and has the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything God does is related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Jesus is the Son of the living God, the embodiment of the divine substance, and He is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we receive this revelation, we can proclaim it to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We also see that Christ has the ointment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All that God does, accomplishes, and intends is involved with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God within Him is life to us, and God upon Him is function to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has entered into us, and we have been attached to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we have the life within and the function without.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By declaring this we are built upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order for this building to continue, we need to drink of the water flowing in resurrection out of the cleft rock, and we need to remain attached to the anointed One and participate in the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we drink of the living flow, we receive nourishment for our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By remaining attached to the anointed One, we have ointment for our function.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have both life and ointment, we shall grow and be built.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matthew 16 mentions the Lord s crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be crucified means to be cleft, and to be resurrected means to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The rock upon which the church is built had to be cleft so that the living water could flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord was cleft, and in His resurrection the water flowed out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Corinthians 15 deals with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His resurrection Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The last Adam was the cleft rock, and the life-giving Spirit is the living water flowing in His resurrection, flowing in the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By drinking of the cleft and resurrected Christ, we receive the flowing water that enables us to grow and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that Matthew 16:18 is now being fulfilled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord has given us new light on the building of the church so that His prophecy might be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have the full assurance that many of us will see that Christ is the resurrected rock flowing with living water.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After receiving such a revelation, many will spontaneously declare, Amen, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By making this declaration, we receive more water within and more oil without.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we declare that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God, we shall be filled with water and covered with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How blessed it is to be a Bar-jona who has seen the heavenly vision and has declared it!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May we be beside ourselves with this revelation and proclaim it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more water and oil we receive, the more life and function we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then by life and function we shall become the corporate Christ, the one Body with the many members to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
