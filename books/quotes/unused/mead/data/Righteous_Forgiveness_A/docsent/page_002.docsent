   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we sin, our conscience also does not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes when the conscience is hushed, we do not sense too much guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But though the conscience may sleep, it never dies!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The minute the conscience awakes, it convicts us of our sins and makes us feel very uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps it is silent today, but it will not shut up forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It will never let go of what we have done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, God cannot forgive our sins lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we sin carelessly and God forgives our sins irresponsibly, then God Himself falls into sin in His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that God does not have the power to forgive sins, but it means that God can only grant forgiveness when it comes up to His dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He cannot degrade Himself to a state of unrighteousness in the process of forgiving our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is forever the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How then did God forgive our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible shows us that we not only received forgiveness in our salvation, but we obtained justification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times the Bible puts forgiveness and justification together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These constitute the two initial steps towards the receiving of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us take a closer look at the matter of forgiveness and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to come back to Christ because He is the key to all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God regards Christ as the Head of a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is also the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first Adam was a huge man incorporating the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he sinned, the whole human race was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God executed His judgment on one person, Christ, because Christ also is a huge corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are included in Him bear all the judgment of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, the Bible says that when Christ died, He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not die as individuals; we die in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His death included all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With this death our sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, God's forgiveness is based upon His judgment in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not irresponsible forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, this is very just.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once a man argued with me concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, "Mr. Nee, if God wants to forgive our sins, why can He not just say so? Why did He have to send His Son to be crucified on the cross? This is too cumbersome!" He thought that God is a nice fellow who writes off our sins unscrupulously without any concern for the law! He did not realize that God had to go through many steps before He could issue forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A few years ago, I was preaching on this matter in a girls' school in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the students could not quite grasp the idea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was a little table before me with a beautiful vase on top.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I asked the principal of the school, "Suppose someone broke this vase.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the rule of the school, what would you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principal replied that reparation would have to be made.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked, "What would happen if one of your favorite students had done it?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She answered that the same rule would apply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I pursued on and asked, "What if she could not afford to pay?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The principal repeated that the rule would still hold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The next day, during the meeting, the vase was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was broken by one of the principal's favorite students who also happened to be very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I took the opportunity to preach once more the doctrine of salvation by the death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The principal could not release the student from her responsibility on the basis of love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the student had no way to make reparation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this dilemma there was only one way to take: the principal had to use her own money to repay for the student.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On one hand, this fulfilled the law of the school; on the other hand it showed the love of the principal for her student.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ came to earth to bear the judgment of our sins and suffer their consequences in order that we may be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The coming of Christ was the very coming of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He came to repay for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By doing so, He did not degrade Himself in unrighteousness; rather, He proved Himself to be just and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is true that God is full of grace, but you do not have to be saved by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You can be saved by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The grace of God is based upon His love towards us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It makes Him willing to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But His righteousness is based upon His Son's death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It makes Him unable not to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before Jesus died, God was free either to save or not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But once Jesus died, God was bound!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is absolutely obligated to save whoever comes to God by the blood of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Have we read this?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is impossible for Him not to forgive us!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is salvation according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before the death of Christ, if He had forgiven any of our sins or had acquitted us from the punishment for sin, He would have made Himself a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now He has caused His Son to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The judgment of sins has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The problem of sin is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God can no longer reject anyone who comes to Him by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now He will make Himself a sinner and an unrighteous one if He does not forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some may think, "Is it that easy to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I am afraid that I need to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have to pray to an extent that God softens His heart and has favor upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only then will I be saved!"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today, even if God would not soften His heart, He still has to forgive your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even if God is absolutely disgusted with you, He still has to grant you this forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It does not matter whether you pray for a long time or not.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, it depends on the fact that redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even if God does not want to save you, it is too late for Him to change His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It would be all right if it were two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, God has accepted the sacrifice of Christ; now it is impossible for Him not to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A sinner can suffer judgment only once!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He cannot be judged twice.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In order to forgive our sins, God has taken all the trouble to accomplish the salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now He has commissioned us to go to the whole world to show others that God has accomplished this work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He can now forgive sins without placing Himself in an improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Others may say, "Why don't I feel saved?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Why is it that after I believed, nothing special seemed to happen?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I don't feel the peace inside."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Please remember that it is not a matter of whether you have the peace or not.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whether or not you have the peace is immaterial.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The important thing is for God to have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He has to grant a forgiveness that is just and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When God forgives you in Christ, He does so righteously, uprightly, and openly.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All you need to do is receive it.</S>
