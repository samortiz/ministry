   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HELP I RECEIVED FROM BROTHER NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH MY PERSONAL CONTACT WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter, I shared that I was called by the Lord to serve Him in a full way on the day that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I gave up my job to serve Him full-time in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee wrote me a short note to strongly confirm my decision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After I gave up my job, I went to Shanghai and stayed with Brother Nee as his guest for about four months.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During that time, I spent many hours with him in personal fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He talked to me and helped me mainly in four things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Helping Me to Know Christ as Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, he helped me to know the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before I went to stay with him, I loved the Lord and had learned a lot about the Bible, but my knowledge was mostly according to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was not that clear about Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I contacted him, my eyes were opened to see life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we came together, there was no form or rule to our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His conversation with me was very free, and he would cover many different subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I considered myself as a learner, so I would always give him all the time to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day we were together, and Brother Nee was sitting in a rocking chair.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While he was rocking back and forth, he suddenly asked me, "Witness, what is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His question puzzled me because it seemed too simple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I knew that his question was more meaningful than it appeared, so I did not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He asked me this question again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then I said that patience is a kind of endurance by which one endures suffering, persecution, and ill treatment from others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said that this was not patience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then I asked him to tell me what patience is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He answered, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That sounded like a foreign language to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had never heard someone say that patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked Brother Nee to explain what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he would only say repeatedly, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was very puzzled and bothered because I did not know what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He just repeated again and again that patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, I had to go back for dinner to the guest house where I was staying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I returned, I did not eat well because I did not have the heart to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I went to my room.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I knelt down and asked the Lord to tell me what Brother Nee meant by saying that patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, during that time, the Lord opened my eyes to see that Christ is my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The real patience is not our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The real patience is Christ living Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was a great help to me.</S>
