   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. The Grain of Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of the first four aspects of Christ's death dealt with the negative problems such as sins and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must see that Christ also died as the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is something on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 12:24, Christ described Himself as a grain of wheat: "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you plant a seed in the ground, that is a kind of death, a burial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But what happens after that?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life comes up!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It even bears fruit to produce more seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life of a grain of wheat is hidden inside its outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the grain falls into the ground, the shell breaks and the life inside is released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, Christ's divine life was contained and concealed within the "shell" of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His death on the cross broke that shell so that His divine life could be released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His life was released so it could get into us!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before, He was the only God-man, a single grain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But through His death He has released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we believed and called on the Lord Jesus, He came into us and we became His multiplication, the many grains!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We became the many God-men just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can express God in our humanity as He did in His.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's crucifixion was neither a small nor simple event.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ died, He accomplished a work much greater than the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That cross was the focus of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through it God cleaned up every negative thing and released His divine life!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That One on the cross was not a simple man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ died as the Lamb of God to take away our sins and release us from God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He died as the brass serpent to crush Satan's head, crucify our serpentine nature, and destroy the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He died as the last Adam to terminate Adam and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He died as the peacemaker to end all of man's differences and make peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And He died as the grain of wheat to release His wonderful life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we had been at the Lord's crucifixion watching with "spiritual" eyes, we would have witnessed a tremendous scene.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God was there working out His eternal purpose, and Satan and all the powers of hell were there battling, trying to frustrate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a war it must have been!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Christ triumphed over them, putting them to open shame Col 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every negative thing in the universe was nailed to the cross and God's divine life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah for Christ's work on the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>QUESTIONS Explain the meaning and significance of Christ being the last Adam.</S>
