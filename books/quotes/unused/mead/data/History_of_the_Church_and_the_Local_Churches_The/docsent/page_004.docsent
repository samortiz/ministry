   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVISIONS OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, due to the defending of the truth, different opinions were brought in among the so-called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then these opinions created great divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, western Christianity became the Roman Catholic Church, and eastern Christianity became the Greek Orthodox Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides these two great branches of Christianity, there were the Nestorians in Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These were the three great divisions of so-called Christianity by the sixth century.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides these three great divisions, there were many free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because many free groups were breaking off from the general church, some designated the general church as the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Catholic means universal as one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Small free groups were formed because some Christians saw that the so-called general church had become worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They attempted to stay in the general church, but eventually they saw that there was no way to help it, so they began to meet by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This happened again and again throughout the church's history.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again and again free groups were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem with all these groups, however, was that they did not see the corporate goal of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of us may feel that the Lord's recovery started with Martin Luther, but we need to realize that the Lord's recovery with His overcomers began in the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within a short time after the completion of the divine revelation, the church fell into degradation, so there was the need of a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's recovery began immediately after the degradation of the church came in. The line of the Lord's recovery started in the second century and has continued throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the centuries those who loved the Lord would not go along with worldly Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They desired to keep the Lord's word as much as they could.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They desired to live with a pure conscience and worship God according to what they saw from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I have to stress again and again that they were not clear about God's corporate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why the Lord's coming has been delayed even to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of how many groups of Christians there are on this earth, as long as there is no proper church life, the Lord does not yet have His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to have the realization that we are the "church people."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day we are "churching."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Churching is our work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not denominational, interdenominational, or non-denominational.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are the church people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are in the recovery of the Lord's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This recovery is not the recovery of justification by faith, salvation, or sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are in the recovery of the church, which includes the recovery of all the foregoing items.</S>
