   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDICES APPENDIX ONE TOWARDS THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason many Christians refuse to join any church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is an unhealthy as well as erroneous concept among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PART OF A WHOLE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the Word of God, there is a corporate aspect to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we are born into the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are children in this family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's family is a big one, and we have to be children with many others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, all the redeemed ones are corporately a house for God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God makes His abode here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, together we constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Individually we are members of this one Body and are related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, no matter from what angle you look, individual Christians are only parts of a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is improper for us to be Christians individually without relating to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such an attitude cannot last for long and is damaging to growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian who takes such a stand will never be able to touch the riches of God or manifest the glory of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BORN INTO THE BIGGEST FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With this view in mind, we have to realize that we are not the only begotten son in this family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If my father has only begotten me, then I do not have to care about anyone else, because I have no brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if I have five other brothers and sisters in my family, then I cannot say, "I just want to be my father's son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want nothing to do with the other five brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are not my concern."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that we are regenerated and have become Christians, we have to realize that we are born into the biggest family of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this big family we have hundreds and thousands of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life we possess demands that we have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is no desire within you to visit other brothers and sisters or to shake their hands, I doubt that your regeneration is a genuine one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The desire to regard the children of God as one's own brothers and sisters is something that comes from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is something sweet and full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nature of the life of God forbids us to be individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot merely seek our own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to fellowship with all the children of God and live in this family of love, which is the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LIVING STONES FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are many big revelations in the book of Ephesians which relate to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter two we see one of them the church is the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What God has been desiring for a long time is a habitation, or a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Chapter two reveals that God's habitation is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church can be God's habitation because as individual Christians we are living stones 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if the living stones are not built up together, there is still no habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An individual Christian may not be a dead stone; he may be quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But he is only an isolated stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is of no use in God's habitation; God can never dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The new life within us urges us constantly to be built up with other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will never be at ease or feel useful until we are built up into a spiritual house for God to dwell in. If we do not do this, we will feel that we are a piece of waste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have to put myself into God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because of me a gap is filled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I am being built, I become part of the glory and majesty of this house.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>MEMBERS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 4 tells us that Christians are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It also tells us that there is but "one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is only one church in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Corinthians 12 says that "the body is one and has many members."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This shows us even more clearly that we cannot be isolated or independent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have been fully redeemed by the Lord and received the full grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no doubt that I am a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But in this huge Body, I am just a member.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I may be a big member, a very useful one, yet I am still only a member.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am merely a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I must depend on the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Together we become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, my body has eyes, a mouth, hands, and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these are individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>My eyes are useful only when they are in my head.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I leave them at home, they will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My hands can only function when they are attached to my arms.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If they are locked in a safe they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The members can never be detached from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If they are detached, they become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a very crucial relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not only are the detached members useless, but they are ugly as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there was a human leg lying beneath this table, or if you picked up an arm on the road, how would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is impossible for you to be detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The members cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They must be attached together.</S>
