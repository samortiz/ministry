It is when "the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" (Isa. 11:9). You can go to God and inquire of Him directly; there is no need for your brothers to tell you anything. You can know God's will yourself, and there is no need to turn to other men to know Him. In other words, there is no need to have your neighbor be your prophet. Everyone can know God's will directly. I receive countless letters every year asking me questions and requesting that I pray for them. They want to know whether God wants them to do this or that. They are saying, in effect, "Watchman Nee is the prophet. We no longer have to inquire of God. We can just ask Watchman Nee to do it for us." Brothers and sisters, this is the principle of the Old Testament. This is the principle of a prophet.</p><p>Does this then mean that we do not have to listen to our brothers? No. In the Old Testament age, men listened only to their brothers. In the New Testament age, Christians should listen to their brothers, but they also have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. I am not saying that we should ignore our brothers or the Bible. I am saying that we must have the leading of the Holy Spirit in addition to these things. Thank God that Moses and Elijah are gone. There is no need for others to tell us what is God's will, for we know within. The Holy Spirit within us will tell us what we should or should not do. If we do not have the leading of the Holy Spirit, we can wait for the prophets to give us the word. What is a prophet? A prophet is a person who finds out God's will for us.</p><p>There was a time when I did not understand why Paul had to go up to Jerusalem (Acts 21:4, 10-14). Many people discouraged him, yet he still went. Why did he have to go? Now I know. Paul had to go because he had to preserve the New Testament principle. In the New Testament age, no one should be another person's prophet! It is true that all the brothers and sisters have the Holy Spirit and can prophesy through His inspiration. But no one needed to tell Paul what to do. Paul should have known in himself whether or not he should go. Those people did one thing more than was necessary&mdash;they became Paul's prophets. This is why Paul ignored their word and went according to his plan. Had Paul followed their word and turned back and had such a history been recorded in the Bible, we would have a terrible case on our hands. Paul was willing to sacrifice himself to maintain the principle of the New Testament. This shows us that today the law and the prophets are over.</p><p>In our faith there is only the Son of God. We cannot have the law and the prophets in addition to Him. The Lord within us tells us what we should and should not do. Many times when others ask me questions, I say, "Just ask yourself." Every saved person should understand God's will by himself. Perhaps our confused thoughts and feelings and our complicated mind have shut us off from the voice of the Lord and the leading of the Spirit. If our heart is pure we will see God. Those with a pure heart see God (Matt. 5:8). But whatever our condition may be, we must always remember that a Christian is one who listens to Christ. We can only receive revelation directly from God. We cannot have the law or the prophets in addition to this revelation. May the Lord guide us to learn this lesson. We must first receive revelation from the Holy Spirit before we can understand God's will. Only then will we have a living testament and not a dead testament.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
