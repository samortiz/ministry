   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Up until this point, we have been dealing with the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must go on to consider the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have known some dear ones who have truly seen the reality of the church, but who were not clear about the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, due to this, they missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need both the reality and the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In various verses of the Bible certain aspects of the church are set forth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we fit these verses together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, we get a full view of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true regarding the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LOCAL CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first verse dealing with the practicality of the church is Matthew 18:17, where the Lord Jesus speaks of telling something unto the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this portion of the Word, we see a clear view of the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 16 we see the material for the building of the church stones built upon the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 28 we see that the way the Lord builds the church is by baptizing people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But now we must discover the place where the Lord builds the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not logical to say that He builds the church in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The building of the church must take place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But since the earth is very large, we still need to know in what place on earth the Lord builds the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This brings us from Matthew 16 to Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In relating the case of how to deal with a brother who has sinned, the Lord Jesus indicates that the church can only be built in the localities where the believers live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord firstly says to go to the brother alone and then, if necessary, with one or two others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he will not listen to the two or three, then the brother should take the matter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, the matter may be taken to the church Matt 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, two or three must meet together in the Lord s name to pray Matt 18:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As they are gathered together in His name, He will be in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the proper understanding of Matthew 18:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, most Christian teachers misuse this verse, saying, As long as two or three meet together and have the Lord s presence, they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have heard this teaching since the time of my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For years I was blindly misled by it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day in my study of the Bible I realized how foolish it is to say that two or three are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If two or three are the church, then why must they still bring the problem to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That the two or three must go to the church proves that they are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they were the church, there would be no need for them to tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, the two or three here are some saints who are part of the church and who meet together, not to have a church meeting, but simply to pray for the troublesome brother.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the correct interpretation of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church mentioned in Matthew 16 becomes practical in Matthew 18, for in Matthew 18 there is a church to which we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here the church is solid, practical, and real in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is not merely a matter of meeting, but of administration with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church has the authority in the flow to deal with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what we call the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The practicality of the church is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen that in Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This discipling of the nations began on the day of Pentecost when at least three thousand were discipled and baptized into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately, the first local church, the church in Jerusalem, came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Beginning on that day, the church was not only real, but also practical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prior to that time there was no practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are not in a local church, we are simply in the air and do not have the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible is wonderfully arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first church established was the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the flow proceeded out from Jerusalem, it reached the city of Antioch, where there also was a church Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church in Antioch was a station of the church flow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From Antioch, God turned His divine flow westward from Asia to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the flow had turned toward Europe, it reached Greece and Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, there came to be a church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever the church flow went, there was always a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only in the local church can the church be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only in the local church and by the local church can we have the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not have the local church, we do not have anything practical as far as the church is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, the Bible ends with seven local churches Rev 1:10-13 .</S>
