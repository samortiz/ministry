   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONLY THE LIFE OF GOD BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although there are three types of life for man, yet only the life of God is really life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other two lives, the psuche and bios, are merely created life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As such, they are weak and temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the life of God is divine, eternal and indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was there before all things and will be there after all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 3:36 also says, "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.''</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two scriptures tell us that unless man has the life of God, he does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows us that in the eyes of God, only His life is life; beside that, no other life can be counted as life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only the life of God is divine and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. The Life of God Being Divine</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the zoe life is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both the psuche and bios life are not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does divine mean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being divine means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinctive from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God is God, only God has the nature of God, and only God is transcendent and distinctive; therefore, only God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life of God is God Himself later we shall consider this point , and since it is God Himself, it naturally has the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, only the life of God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have this life, we have the divine person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. The Life of God Being Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This life is eternal, hence, many verses have the term eternal life John 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does eternal mean?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eternal means uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself and ever, unchangeably existing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only God is uncreated; only He is "from eternity to eternity'' Psa 90:2, original text , that is, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A number of times the King James Version says everlasting life instead of eternal life, but this translation misses the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "everlasting'' may convey to people that a person's original fallen life will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "eternal'' denotes not only the duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life is also eternal with respect to its sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to the element of time, this life will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The sphere or field of eternal life encompasses the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eternal life is so vast that it covers the entire field of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever is in the field of life is encompassed by this eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. The Life of God Being Indestructible</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This life is also indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This life in Christ Jesus went through thirty-three and half years of suffering and mistreatment on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It went into, through and out of death, which can destroy anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After that, it resurrected and ascended to the highest place of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It not only is indestructible, it is victorious, conquering and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life is now in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah!</S>
