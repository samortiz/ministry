<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hezekiah's Failure</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Isaiah Questioning Hezekiah</H2><P>According to 39:3 and 4, Isaiah questioned Hezekiah about the visitors from Babylon. First, Isaiah asked him, "What did these men say? And from where have they come to you?" When Hezekiah answered that they had come from Babylon, Isaiah went on to ask, "What have they seen in your house?" To this Hezekiah replied, "They have seen everything that is in my house; and there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Isaiah Speaking the Word of Jehovah to Hezekiah</H2><P>Isaiah charged Hezekiah to hear the word of Jehovah of hosts. Jehovah said to Hezekiah, "Behold, the days are coming when everything which is in your house and which your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left....And they will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon" (39:6-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Hezekiah's Response to Jehovah's Word</H2><P>In verse 8 we have Hezekiah's response to Jehovah's word. Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good." He also said, "For there will be peace and truth in my days." This indicates that Hezekiah was selfish, caring only for himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Factors of Hezekiah's Failure</H2><P>The factors of Hezekiah's failure include: 1) making a show of what he had, according to his flesh, 2) not being watchful, 3) not seeking after the Lord, 4) not praying, 5) not considering the issue, and 6) caring only for himself, not for God's kingdom on the earth. May we all learn from these factors of Hezekiah's failure.</P>
