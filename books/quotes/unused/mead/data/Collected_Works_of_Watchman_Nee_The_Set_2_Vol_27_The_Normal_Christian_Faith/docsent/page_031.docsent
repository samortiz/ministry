   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SALVATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is where the fall of man began.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also where man's salvation commences.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ recognizes the nature of unity of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the first man sinned, all who came after him sinned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if another man can be established as a source of life and as the head of a new race, whoever succeeds him will be able to share all he is and all he has done in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HAVING SINNED IN ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How does the Bible view the fall of mankind?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It shows us that due to the unity of men, when the first man Adam sinned, all sinned in him, although none were yet born.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way we look at it is whether or not we as individuals have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if I had never sinned from the day I was born, God would ask from whom I came.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I came from Adam, then I was there and took part when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, even if I have not sinned from the day I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to biological law, my life is communicated from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The latest life is the same as the first life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to God, everyone from Adam on is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam sinned; so every single person became a sinner in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose a man has never sinned of course, no such person ever existed .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God would still reckon him a sinner because his life is a life that sins; he is the offspring of a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we do not feel that we have the same experience as Adam, the fact is that his life is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Up till today we bear this life with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ANOTHER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible also shows us another man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God considers Christ the same way He considers Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God counts Adam and everyone from him as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, God considers Christ as the Head and includes everyone who comes out of Him as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life we received from Adam is a life of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we can come out of Christ and receive His life, we can be free from sin in the same manner Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the present, we will not consider how to receive this life that comes out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will explain this later.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We want to see how the life that comes out of Christ is the very life of Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a life without sin, a life that is pleasing to God, filled with the Holy Spirit, and absolutely holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we receive such a life, we will be the same as Christ, having the same experiences He had.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>NO THIRD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, there are only two men in the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Either you have your being in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are not associated with Adam, you have to be associated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot find a third man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once someone asked me, "How many people are there in hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I told him that there was only one, and that there was also only one in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The man in Christ is in one place, and the man in Adam is in another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is extremely simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>TWO ADAMS, TWO MEN</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the Bible regards the whole of humanity as two men, we will not be surprised if we read 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 47: "So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit...The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible identifies the first man as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It also identifies Christ as another Adam, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that there will not be a third Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are only two Adams.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How does the Bible count?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It counts Adam as the first man and Christ as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From Adam to Christ millions of men were born.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the Bible does not count them as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Adam was first.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is second.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, everyone that came out of Adam is included in him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are all associated with sin; they are all sinful, and they are all earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way, those who receive life from the last Adam are included in Christ, having all of Jesus' experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sin has no power over them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>AGAIN RELATED TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once again we see that every doctrine we have is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every experience that a Christian will encounter is bound up with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All that the Bible asks of us is to believe in Him, listen to Him, obey Him, and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The solution to all problems hinges on Him and is found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All we need to do is have Christ Jesus as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His experiences will become our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is the center of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as we are attached to Him, everything will be set right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Adam is a corporate man, including you and me and everyone inside him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His experiences in the garden of Eden have become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His end has become our fate.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the same manner Christ is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone in Christ has the same relationship with Him as they formerly had with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every experience of Christ becomes the experience of those in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The whole of humanity is bound up within these two men and intimately related to them.</S>
