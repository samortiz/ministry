<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Multiplying in Offspring</H2><P>Job said that the wicked multiply in offspring and that their offspring live a happy and rejoicing life (vv. 8, 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Their Houses Being Free from Dread</H2><P>According to Job, the houses of the wicked are free from dread, and the rod of God is not upon them (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Their Cattle Breeding</H2><P>Job continued by speaking concerning the cattle belonging to the wicked. Job said that their bull breeds and does not fail and that their cow calves and does not miscarry (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Spending Their Days in Prosperity</H2><P>Job went on to say that the wicked spend their days in prosperity until in a moment they go down into Sheol (v. 13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Forsaking God,<br>Not Desiring to Know God's Ways</H2><P>Next, Job told his friends that the wicked forsake God and do not desire to know God's ways. Furthermore, the wicked do not serve the almighty God and do not pray to Him for any profit (vv. 14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Their Prosperity Being Not in Their Own Hand</H2><P>Finally, Job concluded that the prosperity of the wicked is not in their own hand and that their counsel is far from God (v. 16).</P><P>I believe that, in general, Job's conclusion concerning the prosperity of the wicked was right. His word here was not according to good and evil, for he said concerning the wicked not only that they have prosperity but also that their offspring live a happy life. Such a situation is not according to the principle of good and evil.</P>
