   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Exhorting the Godly Ones to Pray with Confession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>at a Time When God May Be Found</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6 says, "Because of this let everyone who is godly/Pray to You at a time when You may be found;/Surely when great waters overflow,/They will not reach him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that although David confessed his sin and realized the iniquity of his sin, he considered himself as a godly one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is he sinful or is he godly?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a psalm on confession, but in this confession there is self-justification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He confessed his sin, but he also indicated that he did not have any deceit in his spirit, that he was a godly one, and that he was seeking God at the time when God might be found.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 7 David said, "You are my hiding place;/You preserve me from trouble;/You surround me with the ringing shouts of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Selah."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. God's Instruction and Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then God came in to instruct and teach David.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 8-10 say, "I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go;/I will counsel you; My eye is upon you./Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding;/Whose trappings consist of bit and bridle to constrain them, /Else they do not come near you./Many are the sorrows that the wicked have;/But he who trusts in Jehovah is encompassed by lovingkindness."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>David said that the wicked have many sorrows, but that the one who trusts in Jehovah is encompassed by lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was David a person with many sorrows, or was he the one trusting in Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult to say which category David was in. This shows that his speaking here is according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 11 says, "Rejoice in Jehovah and exult, O righteous ones;/And give a ringing shout, all you who are upright in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who are the righteous ones and who is upright in heart?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not have the boldness to say that we are such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, this is a psalm with a good beginning but a poor ending.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The beginning is confessing, and the ending is self-justification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Basically speaking, Psalms 31 and 32 show us a person trying to keep the law without Christ.</S>
