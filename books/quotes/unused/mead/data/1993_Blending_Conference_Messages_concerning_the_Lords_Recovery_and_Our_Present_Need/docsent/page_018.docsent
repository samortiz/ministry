   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE LOCAL CHURCHES A Local Church Being the God-called-out People Gathered Together in a Locality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How wonderful it is that we are in the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord desires to have many local churches, and this conference is a gathering of many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord gains a lampstand in a city, it is a real victory to the Lord and a real shame to the enemy; and when a number of the churches in different cities come together and are in one accord, it is a glory to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's recovery is a matter of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For us to experience the Lord's recovery, we must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, a single local church, a single lampstand, in a single city is not adequate to express the testimony of Christ, nor is it adequate for the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The testimony and fellowship of the church are something of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These matters need all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this the churches need to be able to come together; they need to be clustered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may like to be alone and isolated, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The churches should be clustered, and the saints should be blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the blending there is a great spiritual benefit and a mutual building up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is something that belongs to the Body, to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The clustering of the churches also stirs up our mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the churches should be the same in fellowship, in the Lord's testimony, and in the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Also, when the churches are clustered together, there is a stronger testimony, and there are the impact and the encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is good for the impact of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality a city, a town, or a village.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Ephesians 4:4, there is one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because both the Body and the Spirit are only one, there should be only one local church in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is very simple: one city, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Testament is absolutely consistent on this point; there is no deviation Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a given city, there should be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is similar to the divine principle that for one husband there should be only one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the situation among Christians today is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a small city of only fifty thousand people, there may be over one hundred different "churches," that is, different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these denominations are divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God ordained that in one city all the called-out ones should gather together as the one church, as the unique expression of the one Body of Christ in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some say that in a city where there are many thousands of believers, it would be impossible to have only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in Jerusalem there were myriads ten thousands of believers Acts 21:20 , but there was only one church 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Jerusalem three thousand were saved, baptized, and added to the church on the day of Pentecost 2:41 , and shortly thereafter at least five thousand more were added 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Still, there was only one church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Romans 16:3-5a the apostle Paul greeted Prisca and Aquila and the church, which was in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that the believers in Rome met in the home of Prisca and Aquila indicates that the number was small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, although the number was small, they were still the one local church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principle of "one city, one church" is God's way, to which we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The oneness of the Body should be expressed locally in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is wrong to have divisions 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is wrong to have the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There should be just one church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only so, all the local churches should not be independent or isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should not be locally a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They should be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They should come together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not think that it is good enough merely to be in the local church in our city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be in the churches, that is, in the Body.</S>
