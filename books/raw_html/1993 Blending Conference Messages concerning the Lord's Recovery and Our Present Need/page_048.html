<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions Damage Christ<br>as the Unique One and His Body</H2><P>Divisions damage Christ as the unique One and His Body. In 1 Corinthians 1:10-13 Paul besought the Corinthians in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that there be no divisions among them. All the believers of Christ have been baptized into the name of Christ (Acts 19:5), that is, into the person of Christ (Rom. 6:3). Hence, Christ's name should be the unique name among all His believers, and Christ Himself should be the unique person in His Body. In verse 13 Paul said that this unique Christ is not divided. Since Christ is unique and is not divided, the church as the Body of Christ also is unique and should not be divided. In making divisions the divisive ones always take a name other than the unique name of Christ. Furthermore, they divide Christ's Body, which is actually to divide Christ Himself, because the Body of Christ is Christ (12:12). Therefore, such division is surely a damage to Christ as the unique One and to the church as His Body. In order to keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name. We also need to take the unique and undivided Christ as our unique center so that all the divisions may be terminated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Corinthian Believers Being Divided<br>While They Were Still Meeting Together<br>to Take the Lord's Supper</H2><P>The Corinthian believers were divided while they were still meeting together to take the Lord's supper not for the better but for the worse; thus, the apostle would not consider that they came together to eat the Lord's supper (1 Cor. 11:17-20). Although divisions existed among the Corinthians (v. 18), they still met together to have the Lord's supper (v. 20). However, Paul's word in verse 20 indicates that he would not consider that their coming together was to eat the Lord's supper. Furthermore, his word in verse 17 indicates that, because the Corinthians were meeting for the Lord's supper in a situation of division, their meeting was not for the better but for the worse. When divisive ones come together to take the Lord's table, it is not for the better, not for profit, but for the worse, for loss. The divisive Corinthians were eating the bread and drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner (v. 27), not discerning the Lord's body (v. 29), that is, not discerning whether the bread on the table signified the physical body of Christ, which He gave for us on the cross, and also the mystical Body of Christ, which is composed of all the believers in the universe. Because of this, those who participated unworthily in the Lord's supper came under the discipline, the temporary judgment, of the Lord (vv. 30-32). From this we can see that division among the believers is a serious matter, and we should not partake of the bread of the Lord's table in any division or with any divisive spirit. We should not take any divisive bread, but we should take only the bread of oneness.</P>
