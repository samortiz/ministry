IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>The five major points that we have fellowshipped above are somewhat theoretical. Let us now consider how to receive the Word with our spirit.</p>
<p>First, we must read the Word, know it, and understand it. This requires that we not only read the Bible but also listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. These activities are matters related to the Word. The more we do these things, the better. Second, we must turn whatever we read and hear into prayer.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered what the one hundred and twenty disciples prayed about in the upper room for ten days? We often feel that we are short of words for prayer. We cannot pray for ten hours, not to mention pray for ten days. Some saints cannot pray longer than ten minutes. The disciples prayed for ten days! What were they praying about? We believe that they must have prayed concerning the promise of the Holy Spirit, on the one hand, and concerning what they had seen and heard while they were following the Lord for three and a half years, on the other hand.</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospels as well as at the beginning of Acts, before His ascension, the Lord charged the disciples to remain in Jerusalem to receive the promise of the Father, saying, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (1:4, 8; cf. Luke 24:49). During those ten days, the disciples must have prayed, based on this charge, for the Holy Spirit to come upon them so that they would become the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In order to become the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses, they had to recall how they followed Him for three and a half years. This must have been the content of their prayer. Furthermore, when they stood up to testify on the day of Pentecost, Peter spoke concerning what they had seen and heard for three and a half years (Acts 2:14-41). The content of his first message indicates that the disciples must have prayed concerning what they saw and heard while they followed the Lord.</p>
<p>One more thing happened in those ten days: the disciples cast lots in order to choose Matthias as an apostle to take the place of Judas, who had sold the Lord (1:15-26). This can be likened to a basketball team that is ready to play basketball but discovers that one member is missing, so they must find someone to complete the team. The disciples were preparing to testify for the Lord, but they needed to make up the lack in the apostleship. They must have prayed concerning this matter. After their prayer, they took care of it. This is another item that they prayed about in those ten days. They certainly did not pray for prosperity, safety, or their health. Their prayer in those ten days must have revolved around Christ, whom they had seen for three and a half years, and the Holy Spirit, who was about to come upon them.</p>
<p>In other words, the disciples turned the Christ whom they had seen and known for three and a half years into the content of their prayer. This Christ and the Holy Spirit were the subjects of their prayer. They had previously contacted Christ by seeing and hearing Him. Now, they contacted Him with their spirit; they used their spirit to absorb what they had seen and heard. As they were praying, the ascended Christ descended upon them as the Holy Spirit and was fully joined with them. Hence, they not only contacted the Lord as the living Word but also contacted Him as the Spirit. Likewise, if we are to touch Christ, gain Him, and be fully mingled with Him in a practical way, we must learn to turn whatever we read, hear, and see into prayer with our spirit. This is the lesson of receiving the Word as the Spirit. May the Lord bless us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
