When we say God was incarnated we mean that God became a man; He took on flesh and blood. This was a tremendous event, the greatest in all of human history. The mighty God who existed in eternity became a lowly man in time. Christ did this not only to become our Savior, but more importantly to bring God into man, divinity into humanity. The more you consider Christ's incarnation the more you will be amazed. That little baby born in Bethlehem was the God of the whole universe! A proper realization of Christ's incarnation is the first and crucial step for our understanding of the Person and work of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. AS GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A.

Matthew 1:20-23 says, "For that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins. Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
