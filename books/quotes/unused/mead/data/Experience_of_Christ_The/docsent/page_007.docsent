   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most Christian teachers know that the book of Philippians is a book of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the arrangement of the books of the New Testament, Philippians comes between Ephesians, a book on the Body, and Colossians, a book on the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, between the Body and the Head we have the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the way to get from the Body to the Head is through the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a strong indication that if we would know the Head, we must have the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Philippians Paul speaks about the experience of Christ in a very peculiar way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our concept, to experience Christ we must clear the past, consecrate ourselves to Christ, open to the inner anointing, and obey the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Along with this, we need to pray a great deal and have fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This concept of experiencing Christ is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is normal and very common.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in Philippians Paul does not speak of the experience of Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It took me more than forty years to understand the way Paul speaks of experiencing Christ in Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FELLOWSHIP IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Philippians 1:5 says, "For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now," and verse 6 continues, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These verses indicate that the fellowship in the gospel is a good work, a work initiated by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ will perform this work until the day of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philippians unveils the fact that the experience of Christ is the fellowship in the gospel until the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice that in verse 5 Paul does not speak of the preaching of the gospel, but of the fellowship in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever noticed that there is such a term in the New Testament as the fellowship in the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No doubt you have heard of the fellowship of the Spirit, for this is very common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fellowship of the Spirit is in our concept, but the fellowship in the gospel is not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the time we are saved until the time the Lord Jesus comes back, our Christian life should be a gospel-preaching life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not here for our education, job, or family, and we are not here to earn money or to gain a reputation or position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are here to live a gospel-preaching life, a life that preaches Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our living should be our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If someone asks your profession, you should say, "My profession is preaching the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, our life is primarily a gospel-preaching life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether I speak or remain silent, my life, my living, my being, and my entire person are a preaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our gospel-preaching life should not be individualistic; rather, it must be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that in the preaching of the gospel we have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word fellowship is rich in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek word rendered fellowship, koinonia, means communication, mutual interchange.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As far as the preaching of the gospel is concerned, today's situation is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Either Christians do not preach the gospel or they preach it individualistically, not corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every evangelist is individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that the more evangelistic people are, the more individualistic they are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In their preaching of the gospel there is no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because there is no fellowship in the gospel, there is no experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if we clear the past, consecrate ourselves to the Lord, and follow the inner anointing, we still may not necessarily have that much experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we preach the gospel in a corporate way, we shall be full of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The book of Philippians does not speak of clearing the past, consecration, or the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it does speak of the fellowship in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am very glad that many among us are zealous for the preaching of the gospel on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I wonder if in this preaching of the gospel there is the fellowship in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we simply engage in the preaching of the gospel, we shall not have very much experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The experience of Christ is not mainly in the preaching; it is in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to preach the gospel in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as you have fellowship in your preaching of the gospel, you will experience Christ.</S>
