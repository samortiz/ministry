After this, Christ as the life-giving Spirit spreads out from our spirit to transform our soul. If we set our mind, the main part of our soul, on the spirit and cooperate with the operation and work of the Lord Spirit within us, our mind will be renewed (Rom. 12:2). When our mind is renewed, our will and our emotion as the other parts of our soul will spontaneously be renewed also. In this way God's life and nature will be added into us, and we will be metabolically transformed into His image to express Him (2 Cor. 3:17-18).</P><P>Finally, He will transfigure our bodies so that our bodies may be redeemed to enter into His glory, and our entire being may be like Him in every way (Rom. 8:17, 23; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2). This is the ultimate consummation of God's salvation. In His salvation, God first regenerated our spirit. Now He is transforming our soul. In the end, He will transfigure our bodies, so that our three parts will be saturated with the Spirit and will be like Christ in every way. All these steps are part of the divine dispensing in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVERS' EXPERIENCE OF GOD'S DISPENSING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Dispensing of the Divine Trinity Becoming<br>the Law of the Spirit of Life in the Believers</H2><P>The Triune God, who has been processed and is dispensed into us, has Himself become the law of the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). This law of the Spirit of life is the automatic and spontaneous capacity of the Triune God as life in the believers. In nature there are the physical laws. Moreover, every life has its own law. A law denotes a natural power with certain inclinations and activities. As living beings, we exist by definite laws. For example, we breathe because we are living. Our breathing is not a conscious activity. Rather, there is a law of breathing. It is an unconscious law that operates in our body spontaneously. As long as we have life, the law of life will enable us to breathe. We may take digestion as another example. After we eat, we do not need to make a conscious effort to digest the food we have eaten. Digestion is a law. As long as we eat the food, a biological law will function to digest the food.</P><P>Praise the Lord, another law has been put into us. This law is the Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life. The processed Triune God has been put into us; He is now operating in us according to a law and not according to an activity. Today, He is a law operating within us. He is not operating in us merely as the Almighty God, but is operating in us spontaneously as a law that is transforming us. Our need today is to cooperate with the life function of the Triune God in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Believers' Experience<br>of the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>Our experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity begins with regeneration in our spirit. Regeneration makes our spirit life (Rom. 8:10). Next, our experience continues by our setting our mind on the spirit; this makes the mind in our soul life (Rom. 8:6b). Then, by the indwelling Spirit we put to death the practices of the body, making our mortal body also life (Rom. 8:13, 11). Furthermore, we walk only according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). In this way our whole being will be saturated by the Spirit, and we will fully experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in our tripartite being. We will daily experience the increase of the Triune God in us. This is the growth in life, which continues until we are mature in life. At that time we will enjoy all the blessings of God's presence.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in San Francisco, California on August 25, 1990)</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
