   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SAVE THE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The world is like a large old ship that is built of different materials.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is wood and metal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But none of them is whole; every piece is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rudder is gone and the ship has run aground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a big hole, and it may sink at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The time is running out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to decide whether you are going to save the ship or save the men on it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is enough time, you may be able to save both.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there is not time for both to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which one would you rescue?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our Christian attitude is that the ship is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if it is saved, it is nothing but junk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The engine is just a mess of scrap metal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No part can be salvaged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We give up the ship and save only the men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Get the people out and dispose of the container.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Besides, our Shipowner is building a bigger ship, a brand new one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is the one we look forward to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our attitude towards the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believe that there is absolutely no solution to the problems of the present system, governments, and society.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only way is to ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problems will be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the new heaven and new earth are inaugurated, the old order with all of its problems will be borne away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we do not take care of those problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We only save people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though society at large will be somewhat affected after individuals are saved, our commission is not to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>JESUS AS SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us look again at the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He never touched the question of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There were many Israelites who would have pledged Him their allegiance if He had proclaimed Himself King.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But He declined to assume that position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did He not have the power to revolutionize the system?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Could He not save His country?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He definitely could.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But He did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He came to save individuals from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He died on the cross and resurrected only to deliver us from sins and give us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first coming of Christ was to accomplish the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It delivers us from sin and dispenses life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He did not participate in social reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But even today, some still see Him as a social reformer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, He never once instigated people to reorganize the government or stage a revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>NO INTEREST IN POLITICS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once some Jews came to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They asked whether or not it was right to pay tax to Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Romans were a belligerent nation and their emperor a tyrant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How did Jesus answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He said, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What He meant was that He was not interested in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He swept all worldly things aside.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He had wanted to overturn the rule of Rome, it would not have been difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But His eyes were not on those things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He emphasized only one thing to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said that He is the good Shepherd who left ninety-nine in the fold and went to seek for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is like a woman who has ten pieces of silver but loses one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She lights up her candle and combs through her house until she finds it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said He is also like a father, who cannot be at rest until his little prodigal son comes home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His purpose is to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has no intention other than this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He never touched social problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His object is man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All He wants is to save him and secure him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>PAUL'S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then let us turn to His apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What kind of work did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Never once did he try to change the social order.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He came only to solve man's spiritual needs and settle the spiritual problems of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He had no concern for the political issues of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In those days Rome ruled over its empire with an iron fist.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>History tells us that they had an inhuman institution of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not only was it lawful to trade human beings publicly, but they could also beat or even crucify the slaves at will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What did Paul command the Christians to do?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He said that the slaves should be obedient to their masters, and not only to the good ones, but to the ill-disposed and cruel ones as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Did Paul lack the courage to stand up against the slave system?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All who have read Paul's letters would agree that if there was a brave person in this world other than Jesus of Nazareth, it had to be Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today God is saving individual men.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When they are saved, many other problems will be solved spontaneously and naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Among the Christians, there is no difference between the Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Neither is there the distinction between free men and slaves, or a discrimination between the rich and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even deep-rooted enmities between races and nations are dissolved among them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Jews have the strongest national pride.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They consider the Gentiles to be dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They are the most segregated people.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But immediately after they come to the Lord, they are brought together with Christians of other cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All tensions and conflicts are dissolved.</S>
