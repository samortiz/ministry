<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE BENEFIT OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TO THE ENTIRE EARTH</h2>
<p>These examples show that what we are cultivated in influences the next generation. What we planted spread from mainland China to Taiwan and even overseas. This proves that all the situations in the world today are to facilitate the Lord&rsquo;s move. This also shows that the seed of the gospel that we plant, the truth that we release, and the divine life that we supply are of manifold value. The benefit they bring will spread to the entire earth.</p>
<p>I was saved as a young man. At that time, a young woman came to my town and held a gospel meeting. I went to listen to her out of curiosity, and the Lord gained me. As I was walking home, the Lord called me, and I said, &ldquo;O Lord, even if You give me the whole world, I do not want it. I want to take my Bible and preach the gospel in village after village. Even if I must eat tree roots and drink water from streams, I desire to preach Your gospel.&rdquo; In the summer of that year I went to the villages. I was still a student, but I resolved that this would be my work for the rest of my life. That was a small dream that I had for the countryside of Chefoo. Little did I know that the Lord would take me to country after country.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, the gospel and life have spread from here to millions of people. For this we worship the Lord from the depths of our hearts. We rejoice that so many young people have consecrated themselves to serve the Lord full time. They must be faithful and loyal to bring in the unlimited blessing of the Lord. There are around two hundred full-timers in Taiwan. We do not know when the Lord will return, but there is a great need before us. Not only do the unbelievers need the gospel; if we open our eyes, we will see that Christianity is desolate and in need of the gospel, the truth, and life.</p>
<p>In 1949 I began the work in Taiwan. I came to Taiwan with virtually nothing and a household of twelve people. We lived in a house that was less than three hundred square feet. I wrote the first publication on a coffee table. When I came to Taiwan, I had only enough money to cover my family expenses for three months.</p>
<p>Before 1949 there were less than twenty churches overseas. Now, thirty-five years later, there are more than six hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on all five continents, and this does not include those in mainland China. Moreover, the literature work has also spread. There are two main stations in America: one is in Anaheim, California, and the other is in Irving, Texas. In Taipei we have the Gospel Book Room with at least fifty to sixty full-time brothers and sisters serving in three departments. The literature work began in the less than three-hundred-square-foot house where I used to live.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING WITH A GOAL AND CARING FOR THE BASICS</h2>
<p>We need to labor in the Lord&rsquo;s work solidly and care for the basics. We should always begin small. The young serving ones need to understand two points. First, if you have a desire and are willing to receive a burden for the gospel, the truth, life, and the church, the Lord will bless you and use you. Second, you should always remember not to aim high in your work and not to neglect the basics. You should not do a work that is a display, having no substance. Our work must be solid. It should begin small and gradually extend to a larger scale.</p>
<p>From the first day until now, this work has not been thwarted by frustrations. A work that is all show with no substance cannot withstand frustrations, but a work that begins small cannot be thwarted by any frustration. It will grow step by step. Even if there are some frustrations, they will only bring in valuable experiences. For this reason, when the young full-timers labor on the campuses, if there is an opportunity to do something big, you should not do it, because you are not able to bear up a big work, and your foundation and roots are not firm. We should begin on a small scale and work step by step, never attempting to make a show. While you are still young, you should learn to plant your feet on solid ground, care for the basics, and not aim high. You must begin in a solid way from the basics. We should preach nothing but the truth, the gospel, life, and the church. If you take the way of caring for the basics and move forward in a stable way, you will surely bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
