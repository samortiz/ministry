<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:8a, 6; Eph. 2:5-6a; 4:4; John 4:24a; 1 John 5:6b; John 16:13; Eph. 2:18; Phil. 1:19; Matt. 28:19b; Rom. 8:2; 2 Cor. 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b</h1>
<p>The title of this small book is <em>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</em> The organism of the Triune God is the Body of Christ. The organism is of a divine person&mdash;the Triune God. This organism is in the organic union of the divine Trinity. The divine Trinity, strictly speaking, does not refer to the person but to something of the person. The divine Trinity is of the Triune God. The organism refers to a corporate person, the Body of Christ. But the organic union refers to something of the divine Trinity. The divine Trinity and the organic union are two matters that are abstract, mysterious, wonderful, profound, excellent, and therefore, difficult to understand. The organic union is a union of life, by life, and with life. In the divine Trinity, there is such an organic union.</p>
<p>The very salvation which we have received and which is being experienced by us day by day is in the organic union of the divine Trinity. We may also say that our salvation is in Jesus Christ. But where is Jesus? Some may think that Jesus is far away from them. But Romans 10 tells us that He is near us, even in our mouth (v. 8). The unbelievers need to realize that the Savior, Jesus, is in our mouth just like the air. The air that we breathe is always in our mouth. How can we breathe the Lord in? By calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we heard the gospel, repented of our sins, and believed in the Lord Jesus, we called upon His name. When we called &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; something happened within us. We received the Lord as our peace, joy, rest, and light. If we try to call on other names, nothing happens within us. If we call &ldquo;O George Washington,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Plato, save me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;O Confucius,&rdquo; nothing will happen within us. There is only one name that we can call upon with a guarantee that something will happen within us. We need to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we have a sweet feeling within us because something transpires within us. Any other name in the universe that we call upon will not give us such an inward feeling. Whenever we mention the name of Jesus, we have an inner feeling of sweetness. His name is a dear name, a sweet name, a precious name, an excellent name, an uplifting name, a comforting name, an enlightening name, a life-giving name, and a saving name. We can use many wonderful adjectives to describe the name of Jesus. In this name is the organic union. When we call upon the name of Jesus, an organic union transpires within us. We are organically united to the Lord, and He is organically united to us. There is a union in life, an organic union, between us and the Lord. We may not have been aware that we had such an inward organic union with Him. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were just ourselves apart from the Lord. When we were saved, however, something wonderful transpired within us.</p>
<p>I can still remember the day that I received the Lord in my hometown in mainland China. I was born into Christianity, and I attended denominational meetings for many years without being saved. When I was nineteen years old, a young lady came to our city to preach the gospel. I went to hear her preach one afternoon, and while I was listening to her speaking, I was caught by the Lord Jesus. I believed in the Lord, but no one taught me how to call on the name of the Lord. While I was walking back home from the meeting, I stopped on the street, looked up at the heavens, and prayed. I told the Lord that I loved Him. I told Him that even if the whole world could be given to me, I did not want it; I just wanted Him. After that prayer, I had the deep sensation that Someone was always with me. Another One is with us regenerated Christians. We have an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>As a young man, I was fond of playing soccer. After I was saved, I continued to play soccer. On one occasion I attempted to kick the soccer ball, and I could not do it. Then I went back home, and that was the end of my soccer playing. Why did I quit playing? It was because of my inward organic union with the Lord Jesus. We are united with the Lord Jesus organically. This organic union is accomplished and transpires within us when we believe in our hearts and when we call on His name with our mouths (Rom. 10:9).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
