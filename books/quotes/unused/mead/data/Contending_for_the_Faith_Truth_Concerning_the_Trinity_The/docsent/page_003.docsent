   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD ACCORDING TO THE PURE WORD OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these days people have spread rumors that our teaching concerning the Trinity is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to let people know that we believe in the Trinity according to the pure word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This message is intended to be not only a declaration to the critics, but also a help to the dear saints in the local churches, that all may know what we believe according to the scriptures regarding the matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This matter of the Trinity has been a subject of great argument and strong disputation among Christians ever since the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the last eighteen or nineteen centuries, the argument has never ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It has been utilized by the enemy to destroy the unity of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not get caught in the snare of endless debate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must come back from the traditional terms, sayings, and teachings to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The controversy concerning such a mystery as the Trinity is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Be on the alert to avoid this trap.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My burden in this message is to fellowship with you regarding this mystery from the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. GOD IS UNIQUELY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be governed by the revelation that God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible tells us that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, because the first occurrence of the word God Elohim in the Bible Gen 1:1 is in the plural number, some people translate it as "Gods."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is preposterous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is appalling to speak of "Gods."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 86:10 says, "Thou art God alone."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not say, "Ye are God alone."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The pronoun is the second person singular, not the second person plural.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Hebrew word for God in this verse, Elohim, is in triple number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you consult the markings in the Newberry Bible, you will find there an indication that "God" here is triple in number.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, Psalm 86:10 does not say, "Thou art Gods."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It says, "Thou art God alone."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "alone" must control our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Thou art God not Gods alone."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps some will ask, "If you say that God is only one, how could God in Genesis 1:26 refer to Himself as Us' and speak of Our' image?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is there one God or more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you say that God is one, how can He refer to Himself using the pronouns Us' and Our'?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My answer is that He is the Triune God and that the Trinity is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you can understand the Trinity thoroughly and define it adequately, it is no longer a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the realm of mathematics or chemistry, things can be scientifically analyzed by the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is science, not mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you can use your supposedly clever mind to understand the Triune God, He is no longer a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because none of us can understand the Trinity adequately, it remains a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not ask me why.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can only say, "The Bible tells us so."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not argue; just take the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In both the Old Testament and the New, we are told clearly and definitely that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaiah 45:5 says, "I am the Lord there is no God besides me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the word for God here is also in triple number, this verse does not say, "There is no God besides us"; it says, "There is no God besides me."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in Ephesians 4:6 and 1 Timothy 2:5 we find clearly stated the conclusion that there is one God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not get into the snare of thinking that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 8:4 says, "There is no God but one."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah for one God!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a basic and conclusive principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why then do we believe that there is one God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this just our interpretation?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can all say, "I believe that God is uniquely one, for the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>GOD IS TRIUNE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This one unique God is Triune.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not know how to explain this, although for many years I tried.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the past fifty years, I spent a great deal of time analyzing and trying to understand the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since I could find no way to resolve it, I gave up long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I said to myself, "Little man, you are too small.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can never understand the Trinity adequately."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A. "I" Is "US"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Isaiah 6:8 says, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is God "I" or "Us"?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may say that He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although I cannot say why, I know that He is both "I" and "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As we have already mentioned, in Genesis 1:26 God refers to Himself as "Us" and speaks of "Our" image.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The same principle is used in Genesis 3:22 and 11:7.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We find the same thought in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In John 14:23 Jesus said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this verse we read of "We" and "Our."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Surely "We" and "Our" are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Are the "Father" and "I" two Gods or one?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Surely they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then why does the Lord say "We"?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you answer, "Because here you have both the Father and the Son," then I would ask you, "How could one God be both?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In John 17:11 the Lord prayed, "Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Notice that here again the Lord speaks of Himself and the Father as "We."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Why a plural pronoun if They are one?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is a mystery, beyond the reach of human language or understanding.</S>
