   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With All Those Who Call Upon the Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of Our Lord in Every Place</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 Paul also says, With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Notice that here he does not say and all those, but with all those.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that a local church, like the church in Corinth, is composed only of those believers in that locality, not of all believers in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It also indicates that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in that one church in Corinth, but for all believers in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians is for all believers of whatever place or time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I had been writing this Epistle, I probably would have used the word and instead of with.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s wording here is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen, it indicates that a local church includes only those in that particular locality, not all the saints on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul wrote this Epistle to the church in Corinth with all the saints on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the local saints are the components of a particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The saints in other localities are not components of that church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, this greeting indicates that this book of illustrations was written not only to the saints at Corinth, but to all the saints, no matter where they may be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When referring to the local saints at Corinth, Paul uses the expression called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when he speaks of all the saints on earth, he uses another description: all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse we see two callings: first, we are called saints; second, we call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that we, the believers, the saints, have been called by God to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been called to call!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be called is a matter once for all, but to call upon the name of the Lord is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Continually we need to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe in Him Rom 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All believers in the Lord should be His callers Acts 9:14, 21; 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been called to call, called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the opening verses of this Epistle, Paul gives us the definition of an apostle, of the church, and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A saint first is one who has been called by God unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, a saint is one who calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Calling on the name of the Lord Jesus is not a matter of praying silently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is to call on the Lord audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians often pray silently or in a very low voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we would call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we need to audibly call out to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can testify that this kind of calling makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you call on the name of the Lord in this way, you are the first to listen to your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not listen to your own prayer, how do you expect the Lord to listen to it?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you listen to your prayer, you will have the assurance that the Lord has heard it also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As saints in Christ Jesus, we are not machines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our praying to the Lord, therefore, should not be mechanical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we call on the Lord Jesus, our entire being is stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our whole inner being is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have pointed out that a saint is a person who has been called by God and who calls on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, some Christians strongly oppose calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But to call on the name of the Lord Jesus is not only scriptural; it is also necessary in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As Christians, we should not be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not come to the meetings and sit silently as if we were dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should call on the name of the Lord Jesus aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we may even need to call out to Him in public places.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may think that this will cause you to lose your face.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, instead of being put to shame, you will be uplifted in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have been called by the Lord, but are you calling on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am concerned that even among us there are some who do not call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are still concerned about losing their face.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we are released and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, this calling designates us as called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In verse 2 Paul says that the Lord Jesus Christ is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is our portion given to us by God Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The apostle added this special phrase at the end of this verse to stress the crucial fact of Christ s being the unique center of all believers in whatever place or situation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this Epistle the apostle s intention was to solve the problems existing among the saints in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For all the problems, especially the matter of division, the only solution is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have all been called into the fellowship, the participation, in Him v. 9 . All believers should be focused on Him, not distracted by any gifted person, any overemphasis on doctrine, or any particular practice.</S>
