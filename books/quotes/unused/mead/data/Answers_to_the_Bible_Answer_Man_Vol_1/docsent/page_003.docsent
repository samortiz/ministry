   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD IN TRINITY 4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The public statements made at Melodyland on October 2, 1977 regarding what Witness Lee and the local churches believe concerning the Trinity contain at least fifteen errors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of these errors are now openly stated and refuted by the local churches:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.The error of public misrepresentation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The speaker charged that "Witness Lee and the local church are anti the historic view of Trinitarian theology and have adopted an ancient church heresy known as Monarchianistic Modalism."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is false and grossly misrepresents our own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have published several booklets available to the public for almost two years fully exposing and denying as heresy every form of Monarchianistic Modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These booklets also contain our belief and experience of the Triune God according to the Bible with positive affirmations concerning the historic statements contained in the Nicene-Constantinople Creed regarding the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet, the speaker refuses to acknowledge our confession and has publicly misrepresented Witness Lee and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.The error with historical data.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The speaker presents to the public that there are two types of Modalism or two classic modes of modalistic theology which he says are heretical theology.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two types or two classic modes he identifies as "logical" and "illogical."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The illogical he says "recognize s that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a false presentation of historical data in order to identify Witness Lee with heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact is that no form of modalism believed that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit existed at the same time; otherwise, they would not have been classified as Monarchianistic Modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.The error of the wrong interpretation of Witness Lee's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The speaker and his associates claim that it took them hundreds of pages of wading and documentation to come up with the fact that the Holy Spirit is in the process of becoming the church so that the church ends up as God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What was conveyed to the public was that Witness Lee believes in a pantheistic evolution into God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a subtle accusation under the guise of having read Witness Lee's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The speaker and his associates have not interpreted Witness Lee in the way these truths were intended.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian public has been deceived by the speaker's false presentation of Witness Lee's belief in the Triune God and His relationship to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4.The error of changing the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The speaker advised Witness Lee to take some lessons in Hebrew concerning Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The speaker stated that the word for Father means "author, source, and origin" of the everlasting according to the Jews, evading the clear title Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a bold thing for the speaker to do in changing the meaning of the Hebrew word used in Isaiah 9:6 for "Father."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This same Hebrew word is used over one thousand times in the Old Testament, and every time it is translated "father."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Father in Isaiah 9:6 can only be the Father in the Godhead or else you hold two Divine Fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have two Divine Fathers is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The speaker should reflect on what is stated in The Pulpit Commentary by Dr. George Rawlinson on Isaiah 9:6:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Everlasting Father; rather, Everlasting or Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the term "Father," applied to our Lord grates our ears, we must remember that the distinctions of Persons in the Godhead has not yet been revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of how the speaker may interpret "The everlasting Father," whether as "the Father of eternity," "the Father of creation," "the Father of the age to come," "the Father of Israel," or the Father of something else, they cannot twist away the title, "the Father" in Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is only one Divine Father in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, "the everlasting Father" in Isaiah 9:6, regardless of how people twist it, must be the unique Divine Father in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>5.The error of omission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The speaker did not say anything about 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit" ASV and 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, "Now the Lord is that Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Probably he ignored dealing with this aspect of the truth because he has no way to answer without twisting the Scripture and ending up with two life-giving Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The whole history and weight of exegesis on these two passages indicate without theological speculation that Christ is simply the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What heresy to have two Divine Fathers and two life-giving Spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must tell people of these heresies, and these heresies must be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are absolutely scriptural, but those who have two Divine Fathers and two life-giving Spirits as the result of twisting these verses are heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us wait and see how they can clear themselves from this charge.</S>
