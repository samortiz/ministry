   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BACK TO THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This wonderful Person is also the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the seed, the Person, and the eternal life which was from the beginning 1 John 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the beginning there was life; that which was from the beginning is the Word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this Epistle the writer considers the believers in three categories 2:13-27 : fathers, young men, and little children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fathers are the older, experienced ones; the young men are the stronger ones; and the little children are the babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fathers, John tells us, "have known him that is from the beginning" 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is to say, the older ones should know life, since life is what has been from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we have received life, many things rise up to distract us from that which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know from our experience that time and again we have to be brought back to life, back to what was there in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are fathers, experienced ones in the church life, our concern will be about life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Other things we must drop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What counts is Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing else is worth ministering but this life which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Apostle John here is the mender.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he was called by the Lord, he was mending fishing nets Matt 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His ministry was to mend.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his time Christianity had already been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His way to mend the situation was life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we need fathers in the church to bring the distracted ones back to the beginning, to life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then to the little ones John says, "Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father" 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To let what was from the beginning abide in them means that they were to let life abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This would bring them into the experience that the fathers had had.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John is telling us that life must be our only concern.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christians are preoccupied with doctrinal teachings and practices, like the method of baptism, the wearing of head coverings, and the way meetings are conducted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If these things matter to us, we are still babyish or at least childish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we grow up, we shall care only for that which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the Triune God as the seed sown into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we care for that living seed, it will grow in us and spread life from our spirit into every other part of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As time goes on, others will be able to notice that a measure of life has been added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the years I have seen this growth in life of the young ones in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How encouraging it is to see not the outward changes, but the growth of life from within!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ASKING LIFE FOR OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This life is first in the Holy Spirit, then in our human spirit, then in our mind, and then in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is still something further to be said about this life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death" 1 John 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a brother has a problem with the Lord, we can pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By praying we can minister life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To impart life to others, however, requires that we have more life ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are filled with the riches of life, we shall have an overflow of life for others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is the need of imparting life to others as a supply to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we ourselves are short of life, there will be none to impart to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The hungry have nothing to feed others; they themselves must first be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we have been richly fed, there will be an overflow for others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First John presents life to us as a seed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This seed will spread into our soul and then into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can have an abundance of life to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What others need is not instruction or correction or regulation, but an abundance of the riches of this life imparted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the church life we are enjoying the spreading of this life from our spirit to our soul and eventually to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As it gains ground in us, we have the riches to impart to the needy ones.</S>
