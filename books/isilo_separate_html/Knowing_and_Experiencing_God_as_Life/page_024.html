AND HE WHO LOSES HIS SOUL-LIFE KEEPING IT</h2>
<p>If we are unwilling to respond to the demand of death by keeping our natural soul-life, we will lose our soul-life in this age and in the next age. Our human life cannot be lived out in a proper way when the divine life cannot be lived out of us. A Christian who desires to be proper, weighty, and noble must lose his soul-life. The more he loses his soul-life, the more weighty and noble it will become. A Christian who only cares for his soul-life and is unwilling to die will eventually lose his soul-life; not only will his life be base, but he will even become abnormal.</p>
<p>In order to be a weighty person, we must lose our soul-life. To be a proper, wise, and understanding person with proper and rich thoughts, abundant and appropriate emotions, and a discerning and thorough view in every situation, we must live according to the demand of God&rsquo;s life by putting our soul-life to death in every matter. The more we put our soul-life to death, the wiser and more understanding we will become. Not only so, our thoughts will be clearer, we will have insight, our discernment will be more accurate, and our emotions will be richer. This is a marvelous thing! But if we insist on keeping our soul-life, we will eventually have a weakened mind and unbalanced emotions.</p>
<p>Let us consider the matter of anger. According to the Bible, a Christian can be angry but not sin. Ephesians 4:26 says, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin.&rdquo; Hence, being angry is not always equivalent to sinning. The Bible permits us to be angry, but there should be a limitation to our anger; we should not become so angry as to sin. To be so angry that we hit someone with our fist is to be angry to the point of sinning. A person who can be angry and yet not sin has lost his soul-life. Such a person has a proper life and can be likened to a good car that can move as fast or slow as needed. Some people, however, are not like this. Either they do not move at all, or once they start moving, they cannot stop. When such a person is happy, he is in ecstasy; and when he is friendly, he is kind to the uttermost. But if there is a slight misunderstanding, he disputes heatedly. In contrast, a person with a proper life can be angry, but his anger quickly dissipates. The life of such a person is not only proper but also strong.</p>
<p>The proper way for the soul-life to be strong is to lose it. Those who lose their soul-life will keep it unto eternal life. Do not consider John 12:25 as something only for the future. Although eternity is included, the emphasis is that our own life will be kept unto God&rsquo;s life. The more our life is put to death by God&rsquo;s life, the more we will enter into His life. As a result, our life will be uplifted, strengthened, and transcendent; we will have a life that has passed through death and resurrection. Then whether or not we become angry, our emotions will be balanced. The result of putting our soul-life to death as a response to the demand of the divine life is that our life is saved and kept by entering into the divine life.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, he has two lives in him: the human life and the life of God. God wants us to live by His life. His life will put our life to death, because the divine life requires our human life to pass through death. If we preserve our own life and are not willing to let it pass through death, we will destroy and lose it. Eventually, our thoughts and discernment will become weak, and our emotions will become unbalanced. However, if we are willing to let the divine life put our life to death, if we are willing to lose our soul-life, our life in the divine life will be strong; we will have a strong mind, rich emotions, and proper discernment, having wisdom and insight. We will become transcendent, strong, and proper. We will not be strong gods but strong persons; we will be persons whose soul-life has passed through death and has resurrected in the divine life. In other words, through death the divine life is mingled with our life, and our nature is changed and strengthened. May all God&rsquo;s children learn this precious lesson and experience such a precious reality.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
