<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Signified by Isaac</H2><P>Christ is the seed of Abraham (Gen. 22:18; Matt. 1:1b), signified by Isaac (Matt. 1:2). Isaac was a figure of the coming Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Blessing All the Nations<br>with the Gospel of Christ</H2><P>As the seed of Abraham, in His humanity, Christ blesses all the nations with the gospel of Christ (Gal. 3:8-12, 16). There is a long bridge from Genesis to Galatians, which reveals Christ as the seed of Abraham. Our labor in the Word through many years has brought us to the end of this bridge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bearing the Curse of the Law<br>and Blessing the Redeemed Sinners<br>with the Consummated Spirit</H2><P>As the seed of Abraham, in His humanity, He bore the curse of the law. Satan tempted man, and man committed sin to break the law of the righteousness of God. Christ as the seed of Abraham needed to bear the curse of the law so that the redeemed sinners could be blessed. Today we are no longer cursed; we are blessed through Christ as the seed of Abraham in His humanity with the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God (Gal. 3:13-14). Christ's blessing brought the triune, processed, and consummated God to us for our enjoyment. These are all deep and detailed points which require our study.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SEED OF DAVID</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Signified by Solomon</H2><P>Christ is the seed of David (Matt. 1:1a; Rom. 1:3), signified by Solomon, the son of David (2 Sam. 7:12b-14a; Matt. 1:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Building Up the Temple of God</H2><P>As the seed of David, in His humanity, Christ builds up the temple of God, the church of God, to be God's dwelling place on the earth (2 Sam. 7:13a; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22).</P>
