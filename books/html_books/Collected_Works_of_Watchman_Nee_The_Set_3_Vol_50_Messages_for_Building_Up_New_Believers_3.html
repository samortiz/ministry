THE PREREQUISITE</h2><p>The matter of recreation is never a problem to a consecrated person. Anyone who is not absolute in his consecration has a problem with recreation. Among God's children, the matter of recreation does not exist to those who are consecrated. In order to settle the matter of recreation, one must first settle the matter of consecration. As long as our consecration is not settled, the matter of recreation cannot be settled. A man who has not settled the matter of consecration may approve what God disapproves. This is why we must first deal with our consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PURPOSE OF RECREATION</h2><p>After the matter of consecration is settled, we can speak about the purpose of recreation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. For Taking Care of the Family</h2><p>We speak about recreation not because of our personal need, but because of the children in our family, that is, our next generation. Recreation is not a problem at all to those who are consecrated, but there are other people in our family. We have children, and we also have brothers and sisters. If they, too, are consecrated, then we will not have a problem. But often they are not consecrated, and our attitude is very much related to them. The kind of recreation we allow or do not allow makes a great difference to them. We speak of the matter of recreation because we want to lead our family in the proper direction.</p><h2 class="head2">B. For Ourselves</h2><p>Sometimes we ourselves also need diversion. To what extent should this diversion be considered proper? How far can a Christian go? We need to see some basic principles before the Lord.</p><p>What kind of recreation should parents permit for their children? What recreation is considered proper as far as Christians are concerned? As God's children, we should all be clear about this. If we have a breach in this matter, the world will come into our family. It will be difficult to drive the world away from our children once it enters our family. In order to preserve our family for the Lord, we have to pay attention to the matter of recreation.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND RECREATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Man's Need</h2><p>Recreation is scriptural and is compatible with the Lord's will. First of all, we have to acknowledge man's need for recreation. A Christian should not go to the extreme. Man has a need for recreation. Many people are very busy with their schedules. If they do not have some kind of diversion, it is easy for them to become sick; their health can quickly deteriorate. The basic principle of recreation is that it should offer some diversion in our life. This is especially necessary for the young ones. We should not expect them to study from morning until night. They must have some kind of recreation. We should not expect them to do the same thing all day long. They must have diversions. We must be clear first about this underlying principle.</p><p>The Lord spoke of children playing flutes and dancing in the streets (Luke 7:32). This dancing is different from the dancing in a ballroom. This dancing and flute-playing are the result of joy. There is nothing wrong with such merry-making. In fact, there is the need for such things. The basic principle of recreation is diversion. A person has been working for five, six, or eight hours. He has been doing the same thing over and over again. This easily can tire him out. Doing the same thing over and over again easily strains one's nerves and tires one's body. There is the need to have a change, a diversion. This diversion will relieve one's tiredness. A change in work recovers a person from his fatigue.</p><p>After a child studies for eight hours in school, he needs to come home to play. This kind of playing affords him a break from his regular schedule. However, jumping and playing around for eight hours is not a break. We must acknowledge the need for a break and diversion in our lives, but we cannot make recreation our whole life. A man can turn away from his work to something else when he is tired, but he cannot pursue recreation all day long. Some people like to go for a swim in the summer. I do not see anything wrong with this. It is all right to swim for half an hour or an hour when one is tired, but if a person stays in the water all day long like a duck, it is not recreation. I would like to point out to you that when a man has a problem with recreation, the recreation in itself is not his problem; rather, his problem is with his living.</p><p>Some people charge that Christians have no recreation, but they really do not know what they are saying. Can something be recreation when one indulges in it all day and all night? These activities are bondages to a person; they are not recreation. Strictly speaking, very few people have problems with recreation itself. Most problems come from man's indulgence in recreation. Some people indulge in activities three days and three nights in a row. Their recreation has become their life. Only such people will say that it is difficult being a Christian. Everyone who has a problem with recreation is an extreme person. They have made recreation their whole life. We must be clear that man has a need for diversion, but he does not have a need for indulgence. He has a need for respite, but he does not have a need for his whole life to revolve around respite. All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for us, but we will not be brought under the power of anything. If we indulge in something day and night, it means that we are enslaved by that thing. It is a great mistake to indulge in something this way.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Four Kinds of Recreation</h2><p>Next, there are four kinds of recreation. A Christian can find recreation in four things:</p><h2 class="head3">1. Rest</h2><p>The best recreation for a Christian is rest. If you are tired, you should take a rest. When the Lord Jesus and His disciples became tired from their work, He told the disciples, "Come by yourselves privately to a deserted place and rest a while" (Mark 6:31). We must realize that the Lord's rest was a kind of recreation to Him. He did not say to go and rest a while, but to go to a deserted place and rest a while. Often a change in place, a solitary place in the hills or by a river, affords a person the necessary relief from his tiredness. This is the most common recreation for a Christian.</p><h2 class="head3">2. A Change in Work</h2><p>If a person feels tired after doing the same work for too long, he can do something else after a while. Instead of working eight hours at one task, he can spend one or two hours on something else. Perhaps he sits down to work most of the time. He can give himself a break by working in a standing position once in a while. Perhaps he works with his mind most of the time. He can divert himself by doing some physical work. As soon as he does this, his tiredness disappears. We are not after the kind of recreation that the world is after. As long as we have a change in the things we do, we have a means to relieve our fatigue. We can rearrange our lives a little. The principle of recreation is diversion. As long as we have a change in the kind of work we do, we have the necessary break we need.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Hobbies</h2><p>At the same time, the Christian life has room for some proper hobbies. Some brothers like to take photographs. Others like to keep birds, plant flowers, or paint. These are legitimate hobbies within the bounds of the Christian life. Some like music; they may write some songs and play them on the piano. Some like calligraphy. All of these are proper forms of recreation.</p><p>But no matter what kind of recreation it is, whether it be rest, a change in work, or a hobby, it has to be something that a person can pick up and drop at will. If a person cannot drop an activity, something is wrong with it. It is all right for a person to take photographs, study them, and learn a little about them. However, we are against anything that controls a person's life. The recreation must be easy to pick up and easy to drop. It is all right for a young brother to play the violin. But if he cannot put it down, he has a problem. The trouble with many young believers is that they cannot put their recreation down. When they find that they are bound by these things, they have to deal with them. They have to sever them, or else they will not be able to go on properly as Christians; they will be enslaved. Recreation must be something that one can pick up freely and drop freely. He must not be enslaved by it. This is an underlying principle. We must remember that in order for something to be proper recreation, whether it be a hobby, a change in work, or rest, a person must not be bound by it.</p><p>Some young brothers like to collect stamps. There is nothing wrong with stamp-collecting. In fact, there are many benefits to such a hobby. It can teach a person about the geography and history of all the countries in the world, but it is a problem when one becomes ensnared by it. Any recreation that affords proper diversion without putting one under its bondage is a lawful recreation.</p><p>Parents must teach their children to have proper recreation. They must not drive their children to improper recreation by failing to provide them with the proper kind. I have seen many strict parents who have ruined their children this way. Their homes are like institutions rather than homes. As a result, the children sneak away from home to engage in improper recreation. We must be clear that children need recreation. We can go with or without entertainment, but our children must have some entertainment. If we deprive them of their right to play, they will be bored and restless at home, and they will sneak away to do things behind our back.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Games</h2><p>There are many games, such as chess, ball games, and horse-riding, which can be considered proper activities, even though they contain the element of winning and losing. The element of winning and losing is related to skill. It is all right for children to engage in table-tennis, basketball, volleyball, riding, or chess. All these are proper activities and do not involve any sin. Parents should be generous toward these matters and should guide their children to the proper recreation. Elderly ones may not have time for strenuous sports, but they should not forbid the young ones from them. We want our children to set aside their time for the Lord, but we also need to take care of their need for diversion. We should allow them some recreation.</p><p>We have mentioned four kinds of recreation: rest, a change in work, hobbies, and games. A Christian can engage in these four kinds of recreation, but he should not be under the power of any of them. It is wrong to be bound by any of them. The younger a believer is in the Lord, the more he has to be careful not to be bound. This matter may not be a problem to us today. It may not make any difference to us whether or not we play the piano, but it makes a great difference to a new believer. His conscience will bother him every time he engages in these activities. At the beginning of the Christian life, the more one is involved in a recreation, the more he is bound by it. As soon as he experiences bondage in any activity, he should stop immediately.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Purpose of Recreation Being<br />to Enhance One's Work</h2><p>Third, we must ask why we need recreation. The purpose of recreation is to enhance our work. Recreation has a purpose; it is not recreation for the sake of recreation. I do not engage in a ball game because I love ball games. I play because I want to work better. I do not sleep because I love to sleep but because I can work better after I sleep. I plant flowers not for the sake of planting flowers but so that I can work better after my gardening diversion. All of these things are for the purpose of enhancing our work. They must help us to serve God better. Some people break down mentally or physically after doing the same thing day and night for two or three weeks. Such brothers and sisters should be allowed some kind of diversion. They can change their work. They can play the piano or engage in some ball games. They should do these things only for the purpose of recovering from fatigue. It is altogether for the purpose of increasing one's efficiency. After they are done with their recreation, they can work better and serve the Lord in a stronger way.</p><p>Sometimes a person may take a respite in a rural place, as the Lord Jesus did, or travel and tour a little. This is also good. He may play games with his children at home as well. These activities are not entanglements; they are for the purpose of helping a person in his work. If an activity results in the lowering of one's performance, it is in the wrong principle. A recreation must always enhance a person's work. It is easy to become tired after doing the same thing over and over again day and night. This is why one should jog, garden, or play for a while. We do not promote these things, but we acquiesce in them. The basic principle is that these activities must enhance our performance rather than frustrate it.</p><p>Having a holiday after working for two or three months is right. But having a holiday every day is laziness, not vacationing. A Christian must learn to work on earth and not be lazy. We allow people to have recreation for the purpose of increasing their work efficiency, but we must not give others any ground for criticism. We do not want to be extreme, and we do not want to bring shame to God's name.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Not Having the Element of Chance<br />in Recreation</h2><p>Fourth, all recreation must involve skill. It must not involve games of chance. We may say that the only kind of recreation that is proper is that which involves pure skill and nothing of chance. Any recreation that involves both skill and chance is a kind of gambling, not recreation. If an activity involves only chance and has nothing to do with skill, it is gambling, and Christians should turn away from it. Anything that involves chance is a kind of gambling. Christian recreation should involve only skill; it should not have any element of chance. A game of dice is altogether a matter of chance; a Christian should never engage in this. It is altogether gambling. Young people can play chess, because chess is a matter of skill, not a game of chance.</p><p>There are two kinds of recreation: One involves skill, and the other involves chance. A game of dice involves one's luck. Therefore, it is a game of chance. A Christian must not engage in any kind of gambling. Some love to play mahjong before they are saved. That is gambling. It involves a little skill plus a good element of chance. A Christian can play only with skill, not with anything that involves chance. He cannot even have games that depend partly on skill and partly on chance.</p><p>Mahjong is a game of chance, even when it does not involve any money. It gives the player a kind of hope, a kind of prayer. He hopes that chance will be on his side. This kind of hope is wrong. Mahjong is wrong even when no betting is involved.</p><p>Billiards involve skill. Even though there are wins and losses, there is nothing wrong with the game itself. However, when money is involved, it is wrong; it becomes a kind of gambling.</p><p>We can say that some games are a kind of gambling in themselves, while others are not. However, one can take a game that does not involve gambling and turn it into a kind of gambling. This is another matter altogether. Even something as harmless as a meal can become a kind of gambling. Throwing dice is a gambling game in itself, even though money is not involved. A Christian should not engage in this kind of game. As Christians, we have principles that govern our judgment. When we say that we can do something or we cannot do certain things, we are guided by principles. It is right to play a game that involves skill, and it is wrong to play something that involves chance. Any kind of game that involves skill is permissible. But any game that depends on chance is not permissible; it is a kind of gambling.</p><p>Moreover, we should not touch anything that the world would consider a kind of gambling. We must have our principles. We must find out what gambling is and what games of chance are. Anything that involves chance is gambling.</p><p>Some brothers ask whether hunting, fishing, and keeping birds is permissible. In the Bible, hunting began from Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-9), and the Lord did not seem to like it. Fishing is permissible. Once you are clear about the principle, you will know what to do with many other things. In conclusion, it is right if it involves skill only, and it is wrong if chance is involved. Gambling is completely out of the question. One would have to be very fallen to ask whether it is permissible for a Christian to gamble.</p><p>Some birds can be kept because they have been domesticated for years and are like house pets; they would not live if they were freed. But we must free those that can survive by themselves. There are domestic pigeons as well as wild pigeons. We can apply the same principles to these matters.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Recreation Meeting One's Need</h2><p>Fifth, our recreation must meet our need. We have a certain recreation because we have a certain need. We should not have any recreation without having the need for it. Many brothers are so busy that they think they have no need for recreation. Other brothers have nothing to do all day long, and they think about recreation all the time. Those who have a genuine need for diversion do not feel the need for it, while those who do not need diversion think that they have a need for it. We do not need to tell everyone about the need for diversion. We do not like to grant license to God's children. We do not want to give a blanket endorsement for any kind of recreation. What we want to tell God's children is to judge for themselves whether they have such a need. The principle is always to live for the Lord and to recognize that all our time is His.</p><p>Life is measured by time. Life is not time itself, but it is measured by time. A man cannot waste his time on everything and then find that he has no more time for God. To waste an hour of time is to waste an hour of one's life. To waste two hours of time is to waste two hours of one's life. If you take an hour for recreation, that hour must eventually be of benefit to you in your work. If there is not the need for this hour, the recreation is a waste of your time. To waste your time is to waste your life. If we can spend an hour more for the Lord, we can reap one more hour of results. If we spend an hour on recreation, and this recreation can enhance our work, it is an investment, not a waste.</p><p>Hence, diversion is based on need. It can also be based on the advice of elderly brothers or the instruction of doctors. Sometimes an elderly brother may advise you to take some diversion because he can sense a buildup of tension within you. At other times a doctor may advise you against certain activities and warn you of dire consequences. Recreation is to take care of need, not for the sake of play. I have my own kinds of recreation. I participate in recreation not for the sake of recreation, but for the sake of enhancing my work. A busy person may need recreation, or he may not need it. The general rule is that recreation is for those who have the need for it. Those who do not need it are not obligated to have it.</p><p>We realize that young people need recreation. We can see the need for our teen-agers to have recreation. Some parents do not have such a need, so they think that their children have no such need. However, depriving children of recreational activity will drive them down the road to evil. We have to recognize their need even though we may not be altogether certain of our own need. The principle is that recreation is for those who need it; those who do not need it can live without it.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Recreation Matching One's Fitness</h2><p>Sixth, all recreation must match a person's fitness. The first consideration in recreation is physical fitness. Everyone must remember this while engaging in recreation. We expect our body to reap profit, not suffer loss through our recreation. If our body suffers through our recreation, we are violating the principle of recreation. We are here to improve our body. If a certain kind of recreation damages our body, something is wrong with that recreation. Suppose a man is sick with tuberculosis. If he wants to have any recreation at all, his recreation must not bring his health down. A sister who has a heart disease may need some recreation at times, but her recreation must serve to relieve her fatigue rather than to aggravate her heart disease.</p><p>When I was young, I had a friend who was a very evil person. After he believed in the Lord, he turned and became a wonderful person. Before his conversion, he loved basketball. After he was saved, he felt a little guilty about playing it. He decided to play it one more time and then quit. After that last game, he vomited blood and died. This was not recreation. It did not match his physical fitness at all. He thought that he could preach the gospel after he had enjoyed his game. He did not expect that he would die after that game. What a waste that was!</p><p>I hope we will realize that our body is the Lord's. Our diversion is for the Lord. Our not having a diversion is also for the Lord. We do not do anything for ourselves. If we engage in some kind of diversion, we must remember that it is for the Lord. Also, if we forfeit diversion, we must remember that we are doing it for the Lord. Whether or not one has diversion, the principle is to not do harm to the body. It is always unwise to harm the body. It is not only wrong to harm our body with improper activities, but also wrong to harm our body with proper activities. The bodies of God's children do not belong to them. In any kind of diversion, we must ask ourselves whether or not it will profit our body. Do it only if it is profitable. Do not do it just because you like to do it. Suppose a sister has a heart disease. If she sees a brother playing ball in the field and wants to join him, she may end up with more trouble. It is not wrong for the brother to be in the ball game, but it is wrong for the sister who has the heart disease to be in the game. We hope that God's children will pay attention to this matter. Everything we do should be done for the service of the Lord. Even if we have a little diversion today, our goal in having it should be to better serve the Lord.</p><p>I do not want to see believers dying at a young age. I have always hoped that there would be more elderly brothers and sisters in the church. Please remember that being elderly in the world is different from being elderly in the church. In the world, the older one becomes, the more senile he becomes. The younger ones are the more progressive ones. However, in the church the older one becomes, the more advanced he becomes. In the world the younger ones cannot move forward unless the older ones die first, because the older ones are always a hindrance to the younger ones. However, it does not happen this way in the church. The older one becomes, the fresher he becomes, and the higher and deeper are the things he touches. A church is poor and defeated if it does not have any elderly brothers and sisters. I do not like to see brothers and sisters in the church passing away at a young age through the neglect of their own body. Instead of becoming a supply to the church, the lessons that the Lord has given them are wasted. The church should not incur such a loss. It cannot afford such a loss.</p><p>When we have sports and games, we cannot strive to break records as if we were athletes. Professional athletes are not motivated by the games themselves but by the desire to break records. We must play it as a game and play it to the benefit our body.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Choosing the Recreation<br />That Matches One's Disposition</h2><p>Seventh, recreation has to do not only with physical fitness but also with one's disposition. When a person is doing what he likes to do, he tends to be more mentally relaxed and psychologically happy. Doing something that you do not enjoy doing is a labor; it is not a recreation. Some sisters love flowers. If you ask them to water flowers for half an hour, they show no sign of fatigue, even though the same task may tire others out. Before they do it, they may be quite tense, but after they work, they feel relaxed. However, if you ask a person who has an aversion for flowers and who hates gardening to water for half an hour, this will be a burden. Therefore, recreation is related to disposition as well. In choosing a certain form of recreation, you must choose the kind of activity that will relax your nerves and calm your mind, like the examples we have just mentioned. Everyone has some kind of recreation that suits him. Gardening is a recreation to some; to others, it is not. Some like dogs and cats, while others are nervous and fearful when they are around them. We must find something we like. These things will enhance our work.</p><p>Asking me to go to the sea would not be recreational to me, but a river does provide recreation to me. Some brothers are different. The stronger the waves, the better it is for them. They are happy to see a boat tossing back and forth in the sea. These are things they like, and they are happy when they do them. Such activities refresh their minds. This has to do with disposition. You must choose the kind of recreation that matches your disposition so that it will restore your physical strength. If you choose something which goes against your disposition, you will feel tired and will not want to continue with it.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Taking Note Not to Stumble Others</h2><p>Eighth, as Christians, we must be an example to others in all things. We do not want to be a stumbling block to others even in the matter of recreation. We live for the Lord as well as for the brothers; we do not live for ourselves. We must not care just for ourselves and neglect others. Do not complain saying, "Why must they look at me?" Who will they look at if they do not look at you? Of course, they will look at you. If a city is built on a hill, who will not see it? Of course, others will see it. No matter what our conviction is, we must take care of our influence on the young brothers when they see us doing what we are doing. We must ask whether the things we do will stumble others. We are children of God; we have believed in the Lord. We must have sensitive feelings. We must realize that we are responsible to God as well as to many young brothers and sisters.</p><p>It does not pose a problem if someone thinks that he can eat meat, but if his eating stumbles a brother, he should not eat. It is not wrong for him to eat meat, but it is wrong if his eating stumbles others. In the same way, it is not wrong to have recreation, but it is wrong to stumble the brothers.</p><p>We must consider what the weak ones will think about the many things that we do. I do not want to be a stumbling block to the weak ones. The Lord did not say that we should not be a stumbling block to the strong. Rather, He said we should not be a stumbling block to the weak. There are many whose conscience is weak. They think that they should not go to the temple. In order to take care of the weak conscience of the brother, I will not go to the temple, even though I know that idols are nothing. In the light of this principle, we should not engage in any recreation that will stumble a brother.</p><p>What should you do if you are peaceful in your conscience about something, but someone else is not? You must take care of more than the peace in your conscience. You must remember that someone else's conscience will be bothered by your action. You must refrain from the things that stumble him. It is not enough to say that you will not be stumbled. Remember that others may be stumbled. It is not enough to say that your conscience is at peace; you must remember that someone else's conscience may not be at peace. Do not say, "This will not lead me to sin." Remember that others could sin because of this. You may not have any problem with this matter, but others may have a problem with it. What should you do? We have to turn away from many kinds of recreation for the sake of the brothers.</p><p>We must see that many things are lawful but not all things are expedient. Therefore, we must be very careful with our conduct, the more careful the better. We must always learn to take the proper way. We must learn to walk carefully. We allow our brothers and sisters to have some recreation. Recreation is permissible, but sometimes this recreation may stumble others. If this happens, it is better not to do such things at all. We must be careful especially with those who easily come under bondage. Some are easily affected; they easily come under bondage. We must be careful with them. Many people fall easily. If we are a little careless with them, they will fall. This is why we must pay attention to this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Not Doing What the Gentiles<br />Consider to Be Improper</h2><p>Ninth, we should not take up any recreation that is improper in the eyes of the Gentiles. This does not mean that we can do anything that the Gentiles consider to be proper. These are the two principles in dealing with the Gentiles. We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of. Are you clear? There are many kinds of entertainment which the Gentiles approve of, but we cannot be involved in them. They approve of movie-going, gambling, and dancing. These are their basic kinds of entertainment, but we do not approve of them. Of course, we would never do any of the things which the Gentiles themselves disapprove of.</p><p>It is not worthwhile for us to argue with people about our recreation. Some people in certain places think that ball games are not permissible. Our testimony is for the Lord, not for a ball game. Our preaching does not testify of a ball game. It is not necessary for us to bear witness for a ball game. Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard. Unbelievers in some places may think that chess is improper. In principle, both the game of chess and the game of "Go" (a board game) are proper, but these things are not our testimony. We do not need to waste our time giving a sermon on chess. We can play it, and we can give it up. Our testimony is for the Lord, not for upholding these minor things. Do not argue with the unbelievers over these minor things. We may do many of the things which they approve of, and we will not do any of the things they do not approve of.</p><p>For example, in certain places fishing may be considered improper. We must accept their view and stop fishing. Our testimony is Christ, not fishing. We have sacrificed everything for the Lord. What is this little recreation to us? We must not give anyone any uneasy feeling because of our recreation. Wherever we are, we should not do what others consider to be wrong. Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard, especially when it comes to the matter of recreation.</p><p>It is foolish for some to argue with others over their recreation. I know of Western missionaries who had bad relationships with the natives just because they wanted to have their own kind of recreation. It is foolish to damage the Lord's work for the sake of a little recreation. We must pay attention to the major issues and be liberal about the other matters. Some brothers have to work among the Muslims, who do not eat pork. When they are among them, they may want to eat pork openly because they think that it is all right for Christians to eat pork. But pork is forbidden in that place. If they eat pork, they will not be able to work among the people at all. In order to take care of the work, we must not come into conflict with others over these small matters.</p><p>Today some may want to go to the province of Sikang. Fishing is unheard of in Sikang. The people there have never fished in their whole lives. It is wrong for you to insist on fishing and thus develop friction with the local brothers. Some British missionaries went to India and irritated the Indians over matters of recreation. It is not worthwhile to do this.</p><p>I have laid these nine principles before you. We must deal with them carefully. The usual kinds of entertainment that the Gentiles commonly speak of are out of the question here. These kinds of recreation include three main categories: dancing, gambling, and movie-going. They are entirely out of the question for us. We are burdened to only present these nine principles on the positive side. We must not sacrifice these nine principles.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. PROPER RECREATION<br />NOT AFFECTING SPIRITUALITY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Hopkins's Rabbits and Small Prints</h2><p>Finally, let me tell you a simple story. The Keswick Convention is a big gathering in England, a somewhat international conference. Every year approximately five or six thousand people from all over the world gather there for a week. I think that God has greatly used these conferences. Andrew Murray and F. B. Meyer, both of whom had a deep knowledge of the Lord, have been among the speakers at these conferences. During this period of time, Stock Meyer was in Germany, Melton was in France, Andrew Murray was in Holland, and Evan Hopkins was in England. Hopkins was known as the Theologian of Keswick. He was the first person to see the truth of the believers' crucifixion with Christ. He was the husband of Hannah Whitall Smith, the author of The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. Mrs. Penn-Lewis would not have been able to propagate the truth of crucifixion with Christ without the help of Hopkins, because Britain could not quite accept a female preaching. Hopkins was a very proper person before the Lord. Yet he had a hobby; he loved to draw whenever he was free. At first he drew serious subjects. Later when he had a granddaughter, he began to draw rabbits for her. When he came back from giving a sermon, he would draw rabbits for his granddaughter. During his lifetime, he drew thousands of rabbits. Later some publishers put out a book on Hopkins's rabbits. Hopkins was an intelligent man. He made the face of every rabbit look different. He also liked to print fine calligraphy. He wrote the whole of the Lord's prayer on a shilling note. I am not saying that you should imitate him. I am merely saying this to show you that recreation does not affect one's spirituality. On the contrary, one touches the human element of a person through his hobbies. Please remember that God's servants are not staid people; that is Catholicism, not Christianity. Christians are plain, simple, and natural people.</p><h2 class="head2">B. George Muller Praying for Woolen Yarn<br />on Behalf of a Little Girl</h2><p>George Muller was a person who was experienced in prayer. Once a girl named Abigail asked him to pray for colored woolen yarn. He prayed about this and she received the yarn. The girl grew up to become one of the best Christians in England. In reading her biography, one is impressed by the lessons she learned in the Lord. Recreation will not drag a person down if it is done properly. If you keep the proper principle of recreation before the Lord, recreation will uplift you and restore your body and mind to proper health.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">WORDS</h1><h2 class="head1">I. WORDS REVEALING A PERSON'S HEART</h2><p>Speaking occupies a great part of a person's life. It is, in fact, a very crucial part of his life. The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34). A person's words express his heart; they reveal the things in his heart. It is not easy to know a man through his conduct, but it is very easy to know a man through his words. A person's conduct may often give others the wrong impression, view, and judgment of him, but it is very easy to know a person through his words because no one can easily restrain or control his own words. Out of the depth of a man's heart the mouth speaks. A man speaks from the fullness of his heart. If a man lies and deceives with his mouth, it means that lies and deceits rest in his heart. When a person does not open his mouth, it is difficult to know his heart. Once he speaks, his heart is exposed. When a person is silent, no one can know his spirit. Once he speaks, others can touch his spirit through his words. His condition before God will be exposed. After we believe in the Lord, we must undergo a fundamental training in the way we live and speak. Our past ways and walk must be completely laid aside. From the day we believe, we have to start everything anew, even the way we speak. We must take care of and pay attention to the way we speak.</p><h2 class="head1">II. DEALING WITH LIES</h2><p>There are four or five portions in the Word that tell us how to speak.</p><p>John 8:44 says, "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it."</p><p>When Satan speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own possessions. He is a liar. Moreover, he is the father of liars. This world contains more lies than anything else on earth. Satan has as many liars as those who are called his. He has as many people lying for him as the number of subjects under his hand. He needs lies to establish his kingdom, and he needs lies to overturn God's work. Everyone who is born of Satan can lie and is engaged in the work of lying. Once a person is saved and becomes God's child, the first lesson he needs to learn is to deal with his words before God. We should reject all lies. We also should reject inaccurate, exaggerated, or distorted words. We should reject all conscious or unconscious lies. God's children must rid themselves of all lies. As long as some lies remain, Satan will have the ground to attack us.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Lies Being Common</h2><p>A person never knows how well he lies until he tries to reject lies. The more he tries to reject lies, the more he will find out how well he lies. Even the inclination of his heart is toward lies. There are more lies in this world than we can imagine. There are also more lies in us than we can imagine. We will not know how much we lie until we try to reject lies. When we try to reject them, we will find out how many there are. There are too many lies in the world, and there are too many lies in us. It is sad that lies seem to be unavoidable even among God's children. It is sad that lies occupy such a place among us. The Lord's Word is both serious and clear. Everyone who lies is a child of Satan, and Satan is the father of all liars. The most unfortunate thing in the whole world is for the satanic seed of lying to remain in the hearts of God's children. We cannot remain believers for years yet remain indifferent toward our lies. It will be too late if we wait for many years to deal with them. We have to learn to speak accurately as soon as we believe in the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">B. What Lies Are</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Double-tongued</h2><p>To be double-tongued is to lie. A person is lying when he first says one thing and then turns around and says something else, when he first says yes and then no, when he first says that something is good and then says that it is bad, or when he first agrees that something is right and then says that it is wrong. This is not just a matter of a wavering mind but a matter of lying.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Speaking according to What One Likes or Dislikes</h2><p>We tell others what we like and keep silent about what we do not like. We speak about what is profitable to us and keep silent about things that are not profitable to us. This is also a kind of lying. Many people purposely withhold half of a story. They withhold the things that are profitable to others, especially things that are profitable to their enemies, and remain silent about them. Instead, they talk about things that hurt, damage, or bring loss to others. This is lying. Many people do not speak according to truth and reality, but according to their own likes and dislikes. Many words are not based on facts but on sentiments. Such people speak certain things because they like to speak them, or they speak about certain persons because they like them. They change their tone when the conversation turns to people or things they do not like. This kind of speaking is totally according to one's likes and dislikes. It is speaking according to one's emotion, not according to truth and reality. Please keep in mind that this is lying. Inaccurate words are a serious sin. Willful deception is even more serious, and it is a greater sin before God. We must not speak according to our emotion but according to facts. Either we must not speak at all, or we must speak according to facts and the truth. We cannot speak according to our feeling. If we do, we are lying willfully before God.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Speaking according to One's Hopes</h2><p>Furthermore, we must learn to put away our own feelings; we should not have any expectations of others. Many words today represent hopes rather than facts. They do not convey facts; they only convey a man's hopes. A person often reviles a sister or a brother according to his sentiment rather than according to fact. He only hopes that a sister is as bad as he thinks, yet he speaks as if the sister is indeed that bad. Or he only hopes that a brother will fall, yet he speaks as if the brother has fallen already. He speaks according to what he wishes would happen, not according to what has actually happened. Do you see the fundamental problem here? Often a person speaks according to what he expects in his heart. His words do not convey what has actually happened. Rather than speaking of the actual situation, he speaks of what he expects the situation to be.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Adding One's Own Thoughts</h2><p>Why is it that many words are altered when they pass from one mouth to another? A statement often is changed completely after passing through three or four mouths. Why? This is because each person adds his own thoughts instead of finding out the facts. No one tries to find out the facts, yet everyone tries to add his own thoughts. This is lying.</p><p>There is one basic principle of speaking: One must not speak according to his feeling or hope. A person is lying when he is not speaking according to truth and reality but according to expectation and hope. We should learn to speak according to facts and not express any opinion of our own. If we are giving our opinion, we need to make it clear that this is our opinion. When we are speaking a fact, we need to state that this is a fact. We must separate our opinions from facts. We should not mix facts with our opinions. What we think a person is and what a person actually is are two different things. At the most we can say that the fact indicates one thing but we have a different thought concerning the matter.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Exaggeration</h2><p>There is another type of lie which is very prevalent in the church&mdash;exaggeration. Please bear in mind that inaccurate numbers and inaccurate words, as well as the love of big words, strong words, or exaggerated words, are different forms of lies because there is falsehood in all of them.</p><p>Today if you want to know where a saint's heart is before the Lord, all you have to do is tell him something and ask him to tell others about it. You will immediately know where his heart is before the Lord. A person who fears God, who has learned the proper lessons, and who has been dealt with by God will consider speaking a great thing. He will not dare to speak carelessly or spread words carelessly. He will pay attention to accurate words. When you commit a word to a person who has not been dealt with or disciplined by the Lord, he will spread the word zealously. In his spreading you will find that he is a frivolous, deceitful, and dishonest person. He can add many words of his own and withhold words that should be spoken.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Inflated Numbers</h2><p>When many people speak, inflated numbers are quoted. No church in Shanghai has a sitting capacity of five thousand. Any preacher with some training will know the capacity of a hall with just one look. However, many reports about revival meetings have described the attendance at ten or even twenty thousand people. Even if every person stood on the head of another, there would still not be enough room for everyone. Yet these are words from Christian workers. This is exaggeration! This kind of exaggeration is lying. We magnify others' mistakes and minimize our own. We exaggerate others' errors and try the best to reduce our own. This is lying as well.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Conscientiously Learning to Be an Honest Person</h2><p>Today I cannot say that all of God's children become honest after they are saved. If they set their minds before the Lord to learn these lessons for five years, perhaps they will be an honest person by the end of the five years. Allow me to say a strong word: A person must continually reject all kinds of lies. Whenever you find yourself speaking something inaccurately, you have to repudiate it relentlessly. If you practice this, perhaps you will become an honest person after three or five years. You cannot expect a person who is careless and capricious about his speaking to become an honest person overnight. Lies and inaccuracies are common maladies among Christians. Everyone in this world follows Satan and everyone lies. Some people are slow, while others are smart, but everyone lies. Some lie without skill while others lie with skill, but everyone lies. We need to deal with the Lord constantly so that we are warned as soon as we lie or touch the spirit of lying.</p><p>How important it is to be honest, yet how unnatural it is to be honest! Our very nature is dishonest, and from the time we were born, we have lied. We like to speak according to our preference, but not according to truth. A child must learn to do things step by step from the very beginning of his human life. As God's children, we also need to learn our lessons from the very beginning. If we become careless, we will lie and speak inaccurate words.</p><p>The problem of lying is a very common one. It is the darkest sin and the most common sin. Many people regard this as a light matter. If we have a problem with our speaking, two things will happen: First, the church will find itself filled with death, and Christians will find it impossible to walk in oneness. Second, God cannot make us ministers of His word, and our usefulness will stop. We can still speak a little on the Bible, on truth, and on doctrine, and we can still give a speech, but we will not be able to serve as ministers of God's word. In order to be a minister of God's word, one must be honest in his speaking. If he is not honest, God cannot use him.</p><p>May we all see the need to reject lies. We should not speak according to our own desire. We should reject all lies completely. We should not speak in a subjective way, but in an objective way. We should speak according to facts, according to what we hear, and not according to how we feel. If God's children practice this, a straight path will await them.</p><h2 class="head1">III. NO IDLE WORDS</h2><p>Another type of words which should never come out of our mouth is idle words. Matthew 12:35-37 says, "The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things. And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</p><p>Before the Lord Jesus said this, He said, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known" (v. 33). According to the context, the fruit does not refer to one's conduct, but to one's word. This means that a person's words are good if that person is good, and a person's words are evil if that person is evil. We know a person by the words he speaks. There are some who gossip day and night. They tell tales all the time about others and are full of slander, railing, criticism, and judgment. Their mouths are filled with all kinds of filthy, dirty, and evil things. It is obvious that they are corrupt trees.</p><p>The problem among God's children today is that they cannot judge others by the words they speak. They cannot judge, because they are the same. The Lord tells us that the good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things. The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. By its fruit the tree is known.</p><p>If a brother spreads evil, critical, or sinful things all the time, we do not need to determine whether his words are true. We can tell him that his act of spreading such things is itself an unclean matter. We must realize that the words of God's children are the fruit of their mouth. No one whose heart is holy will speak filthy things. No one whose heart is filled with love will speak hatred. By its fruit the tree is known.</p><p>This does not mean that we can speak anything as long as it is true and factual. Sometimes it is not a matter of whether or not something is a fact. Something may be a fact, a definite fact, yet it should not be a fruit of our mouth. It may be true, but we should not utter it. This is not a matter of truth, but a matter of idle words. The word may be true, but it is an idle word. I have just said that our speaking must be according to facts. However, not all facts need to be spoken. We cannot and we need not speak idle words.</p><p>The Lord said, "And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" (v. 36). Idle words from a Christian's mouth will not be spoken once but twice. Whatever is spoken carelessly today will be repeated again in the future. It will be repeated in full, sentence by sentence. When it is repeated the second time, we will be justified or condemned based on it. We will have to render an account on the judgment day for every idle word we have spoken. I hope that God's children will learn to fear Him. We should learn to reject every inaccurate word and to speak accurately. We should never speak about things that do not concern us, and we should not say anything that reaps no benefit to others or to ourselves.</p><p>One can tell how much a person has been dealt with by the Lord by the words out of his mouth. No one who has been disciplined by God has an undisciplined mouth. A person who lies or who speaks idle and careless words is of little use to God; he is good only for the day of judgment. We have to learn this lesson from the beginning. Those who speak defiled words are defiled persons. Those who speak corrupted words are corrupted in themselves. The kind of words we speak reveals the kind of persons we are. By its fruit a tree is known. By our words we are known.</p><p>It is important that we pay attention to this matter. We know a brother by the way he speaks. Today the church is filled with lies and idle words. How strange it is that few children of God ever condemn them! No one among us has the right to speak any idle words.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. NO EVIL WORDS</h2><p>First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing. For `he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile. And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.'"</p><p>Another kind of words which should never come out of a Christian's mouth is evil words. What are evil words? Evil words are words of reviling, words of cursing. A child of God cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Learning to<br />Speak Words of Blessing</h2><p>Many people think that they have the right to speak a certain way because others have spoken the same way. Today the world argues about who said what first, but the Lord is concerned about whether or not one has spoken at all. We may ask, "Since others have already said this, can I not say it as well?", but please bear in mind that we cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling. It is not a matter of who spoke first, but a matter of whether or not you spoke at all.</p><p>A new believer must learn to speak words of blessing from the very beginning. Do not allow reviling or cursing to come out of your mouth.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Controlling One's Temper</h2><p>Furthermore, a person must control his temper. He must control his temper before he can control his words before God. A person's words are not controlled if his temper is not controlled. Many evil words come out of a person's mouth because his temper is not controlled. If God's children are not exercised, reviling and filthy words will come out of their mouths. Many people do not know how to control their temper, and their mouths are full of reviling words. On the one hand, these words do not glorify God. On the other hand, they deprive a person of any blessing from God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. BEING RESTRICTED IN WORDS</h2><p>Now we come to the fifth point. We need to know what we should pay attention to in our speaking. James 3 specifically deals with our words. Let us read verses 1 through 12. We need to find out how God's children should speak.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Not Becoming Many Teachers</h2><p>Verse 1 says, "Do not become many teachers, my brothers." Why? "Knowing that we will receive greater judgment." The most outstanding characteristic of those who are undisciplined in their words is their desire to be teachers. Wherever they go, they like to teach. Wherever they are, they have something to say. They want to be teachers of others under any circumstance. They can give their lectures free of charge. Many people like to be teachers and counselors. When they are among others, they always have a great deal to say. Do you see the problem here? A Christian must not only stop lying, gossiping, and speaking evil words. He should not even be wordy at all. No matter what kind of words he speaks, he is wrong as long as he speaks too much. As soon as a man speaks too much, he loses all of his blessing before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Mark of Self-control Being Seen<br />in One's Words</h2><p>Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well." Whether or not a person can bridle himself depends on whether he can bridle his words. Whether or not a person has self-control&mdash;a fruit of the Spirit&mdash;depends on whether he can bridle his words. Many brothers and sisters misunderstand the Bible. They think that self-control is moderation. Please keep in mind that self-control is self-control. The teaching of moderation has nothing to do with us. Christians should exercise self-control, which means that they should control themselves.</p><p>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5 shows us what the fruit of the Spirit is, while James tells us what the mark of the fruit of the Spirit is. James says a person who is able to bridle his whole body is surely able to bridle his words. Those who are loose in their words are loose in their living. Those who speak foolishly conduct themselves foolishly. A person who is indiscreet with words is surely indiscreet in everything he does. A person who has many words is bound to be a careless person before God. Whether or not a person can bridle his whole body depends on whether he can bridle his mouth. I hope that from now on all the new believers will learn to bridle their words before God.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters pray for God to deal with them and to grant them mercy. I will say a word to them: If God can deal with your speaking, He can deal with you. There are many people whose speaking constitutes the very life of their being. Their speaking represents their strength, the very hollow of their thigh. If God can deal with their speaking, He can deal with their whole being. Many people have not been defeated by God in their speaking. As a result, their very being has not been defeated by God. If a man has no self-control over himself, he may act in certain ways. But once others talk to him for half an hour, they realize the kind of person he is. As soon as a man opens his mouth, his very being is exposed. Nothing exposes a person more than his words. As soon as a man speaks, his very being is fully exposed. If you want to see whether a man can control himself, simply ask if he can control his speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Smallest Affecting the Greatest</h2><p>Verse 3 takes a bridle for an illustration, while verse 4 takes a rudder for an illustration. The tongue is like a bridle. It is also like a rudder. It is the smallest thing, yet it can exert the greatest influence. Verse 5 says the smallest fire can ignite a great forest. Verse 6 says, "And the tongue is a fire; the very world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna." Verse 3 speaks of a bridle. Verse 4 speaks of a rudder. Verse 5 says that the tongue is a little member that boasts great things. Verse 6 shows us that the tongue is a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is a world of its own, a world of unrighteousness. Many people are redeemed; they have experienced God's mercy, yet their tongues have never been bridled. Everywhere they go, they ignite the fire of Gehenna with this world of unrighteousness.</p><p>This is a strong word: The tongue can set on fire the wheel of nature (v. 6, ASV). Life is like a wheel; it is turning all the time. The tongue is like a fire that can set the wheel of life on fire. This means that it can stir up all kinds of fleshly activities. Man's wrath, flesh, temper, and anger can all be ignited by the tongue. The tongue can ignite the fire of Gehenna. Many troubles flare up through words by God's children. That is truly something from Gehenna. The tongue is an igniting fire and is a world of unrighteousness.</p><p>We must learn to diminish our words. The less words we speak, the better we are. There is transgression in the multitude of words. Proverbs advises us to have few words. Only fools are profuse in words. The more foolish a person is, the more words he has. The more lessons a person has learned before God, the more steadfast he is and the fewer words he has.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Tongue Being a Restless Evil</h2><p>James 3:7 says that every living thing can be tamed, while verse 8 says that no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. The tongue cannot be tamed by man. It is full of deadly poison. It is an untamed evil, "a restless evil." There are evils that can be tamed, but the evil of the tongue cannot be tamed. How foolish it is to loosen one's tongue! If a man relaxes his tongue, he is a very foolish man indeed.</p><h2 class="head2">E. A Spring Cannot Gush Out Two Types of Water</h2><p>What follows is clear and obvious. One cannot bless God with his tongue and use the same tongue to curse the man created by God. He cannot bless on the one hand and curse on the other hand. A spring cannot gush out two types of water. A fig tree cannot produce olives, nor can a vine produce figs. Salt water cannot produce sweet water. The fruit reveals the tree. The water reveals the spring. A person whom God uses surely produces sweet water; there should not be any bitter taste to his words.</p><p>God's way of salvation today is to install a new spring and a new tree in us. If I am a fig tree, I will surely not produce olives. If I am a vine, I will surely not produce figs. If God gives me something new, if He places a new life in me, surely I will produce sweet water.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. PAYING ATTENTION TO LISTENING</h2><p>In addressing the matter of speaking, we must not neglect the matter of listening.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Resisting an Itching Ear</h2><p>Let me speak a frank word to all of you. Many improper words in the church would disappear if all the brothers and sisters learned the lesson of listening. The church has so many improper words because there are many brothers and sisters who want to listen to them. There is the demand; therefore, there is the supply. There are so many defiling words, criticisms, evil speakings, slanders, double-tongued speakings, because many people want to hear them. Man's heart is deceitful, wicked, and defiled. Because the heart wants to hear these words, someone is always ready to speak them.</p><p>If God's children know the kinds of words they can and cannot speak, they will know the kinds of words they can and cannot hear. One brother put it aptly when he said, "Many people's ears are like trash cans." Does anyone ever dump trash into a rice pot? No one would do such a thing. If you accept all kinds of lecherous words and do not consider them harmful, clearly you are a trash can; that is the kind of person you are. Only a certain kind of person will listen to certain kinds of words.</p><p>We must learn to listen to healthy words. We should not be led away by those who spread rumors and improper words. We must say, "I do not want to listen to these things." Many sins will cease and many brothers will be edified if you do this. There is a lust among us for unhealthy words. This is why these words multiply. People find these words tasteful. We must be delivered from these things. If a person is saying something improper to you, perhaps you should walk away quietly and leave the speaker to himself. This will kill his interest in you the next time. Alternatively, we also can testify to him saying, "As Christians we should not speak such words." This will stop any further speaking. We may even say something stronger, such as, "Brother! What do you think I am? I am not a trash can. Please do not dump all this trash on me."</p><p>Many problems in the church are like Gehenna fire; they need to be quenched as soon as they catch fire. We must not allow them to spread. Many troubles related to words are actually troubles related to listening. The speaker, of course, bears a greater part of the responsibility. But the listener also bears a small part of the responsibility. The listener must learn before God to reject this lust for words. Man has a lust for words; he has a lust to know everything. If we can reject this lust, we will quench much fire from Gehenna. We should say, "I am sorry. I am a Christian, and I cannot take such words." We will cut short the words of others. If we keep on listening, hoping to learn a little more and to probe a little more, we are fanning the flame, not extinguishing it. Many idle, evil, and deceptive words are prompted by the interest of the listeners.</p><h2 class="head2">B. "Like a Deaf Man"</h2><p>Psalm 38:13-14 says, "But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; /And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth./Indeed I am like a man who does not hear/And in whose mouth there are no reproofs." Many people indeed need to be as a deaf man who does not hear. When others speak unbecoming things, you should act like a deaf man who does not hear anything. You should simply say, "I cannot hear." If you want to be a little stronger, you can testify something to him. If you want to be stronger still, you can rebuke him, saying, "Brother! What do you think I am? Why do you dump so many words on me?" You can also give a word of testimony: "I think a Christian should not say such things. Such words should not come out of a Christian's mouth." You may also say, "Brother! Wait a minute before you continue to speak. I am leaving." If you are a deaf man, you will be blessed. Many times you have to act like a deaf man who does not hear anything. You must also learn to be like the dumb who cannot speak anything. Words are a great temptation, and you must learn to overcome them.</p><p>In Isaiah 42, which is altogether a prophecy concerning the Lord Jesus, verse 19 says, "Who is blind except My servant, /And as deaf as My messenger, whom I will send?/Who is as blind as the one at peace with Me,/And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?" When the Lord was on the earth, there were many words He would not listen to.</p><p>Please remember that the less filth and gossip we hear, the less trouble we will have. We have enough troubles, problems, and filth within ourselves already. If we add more to them, we will not be able to go on at all. A new believer must learn from the beginning to reject the temptation of listening. We must be deaf like the Lord Jesus was. Who is deaf like our Lord? The way of our Lord is most upright. This is why He is not bound by anything.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Making a Conscious Effort to Learn</h2><p>New believers must be taught in the matter of speaking. They must be taught the way to speak, and they also must be taught the way to listen. They must learn to fear God in the matter of speaking. This is a great matter, and it is a definite threshold which one has to cross definitely.</p><p>This lesson does not come without a price. We need to spend much time to develop the habit of speaking accurately. I do not believe a new believer in the Lord can overcome in this matter in a short time. I have found out that accurate words are more difficult to come by than many other things. If we allow a little carelessness to come in, we will find mistakes in our words and motives. Lying is one example of this. Speaking inaccurate words is a form of lying, and so is any attempt to mislead others. Sometimes a person may say the right thing with the intention of misleading others. This is lying as well. A new believer must pay attention to this matter and must exercise considerable effort to deal with it from the very beginning.</p><p>Psalm 141:3 says, "Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips." We need to have such a prayer. We need to say, "Set a watch over my tongue so that I will not speak rashly." Perhaps some will need to pray, "Set a watch over my ears so that I will not listen carelessly." If we do this, the church will be spared many troubles and we will advance in a proper way.</p><p>One thing surprises me greatly. Many brothers are bold to speak carelessly, and many people listen to them with no sense of fear at all. This is a great sickness among us! Clearly this is a grave malady! Whenever we lend our ears to improper words, we are sick! It is a serious sickness for anyone to accept words without reservation or discretion! We must learn to reject filthy fruit. Any kind of poison will spread among God's children and will bring in ungodliness, rebellion, and looseness. May God be gracious to us and have mercy on us so that we would learn to speak in a proper way from the very beginning. May we learn to run the straight race before us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">CLOTHING AND FOOD</h1><p>We will now talk about clothing and food as they pertain to Christians. First, we will speak about clothing for Christians.</p><h2 class="head1">I. CLOTHING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of Clothing</h2><p>First, let us consider the meaning of clothing. In order to understand the need for clothing, we must go back to the very beginning.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Clothing Not Needed before the Fall</h2><p>Before man fell into sin, his clothing, perhaps, was a mere form of light around him. He was innocent, and he had no feeling of shame before the fall. Although he did not wear anything, he was not ashamed.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Clothing Needed<br />to Cover Man's Shame after the Fall</h2><p>When sin came in, the first effect on man was the realization of his own nakedness; he felt ashamed immediately. Adam and Eve made aprons of fig leaves and put them on. This shows us the basic significance of clothing; it is for covering. Clothing is necessary because we need to cover ourselves. It is a pity that the aprons of fig leaves did not last. The leaves soon dried up, broke into pieces, and disintegrated. God then clothed man with animal skins. He prepared something solid and lasting for man. The purpose of this clothing was to cover the body.</p><p>Hence, clothes are for covering the body; they are not for exhibition. Any clothes which do not serve the simple purpose of covering the body are wrong. Clothing is for covering the body.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Blood Being Needed for Exposed Areas</h2><p>The Israelites wore sandals in the land of Judea. They did not have socks, and their feet were exposed to the earth. The rest of their body was covered with clothing. Other than their hands, feet, and head, their whole body was covered. When the priests went before God with the blood, the blood was applied to the thumb of the hand, the toe of the foot, and the ear. This shows us that the exposed areas had to be covered by the blood. The blood was not applied to the other parts of the body. The hands, feet, and head were the only areas which needed the blood. The other areas were covered by clothing. This shows us that the purpose of clothing is for covering. We must realize before God that it is proper for man to be covered.</p><p>Today's degradation can be traced to man's degeneration to his uncivilized state. In such a state he clothes himself scantily. It is improper for man to be scantily clothed. Clothing is for covering, and any clothing that is not for covering violates God's definition of a covering. The blood is a type. Its spiritual significance points to the need of covering. Man has sinned and needs covering before God. Today any shortening of sleeves or hems, or any clothing which exhibits rather than covers the body, is of the world. God is not pleased with such clothing.</p><p>In view of this, the more covering a garment affords, the better it is. I am a sinner, and my need is to be completely covered before the Lord. I do not want any part of my being to be exposed before Him. We are Christians who are saved and who have put our trust in the Lord. However, we have no standing before the Lord unless we are fully covered by Him. We look for covering and pray that our whole being would be fully covered by Him so that every part of our being would be redeemed and saved. According to the type in the Scripture, whatever is not covered by one's clothing must be covered by the blood. Our hands, feet, and head must all be under the blood.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Man's Second Fall Due to Nakedness</h2><p>When Adam and Eve sinned, their nakedness exposed their sin. Noah came out of the ark 1,656 years later. He planted a vineyard and became drunk. As a result, he took off his clothes and exposed himself. The first man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and found himself naked. The next man found himself naked after eating the fruit of the vine. The second fall of man came when he did not put on the clothing he was supposed to put on. Adam fell from a state where he needed no clothing to a state where he needed clothing. Noah fell when he had clothing but did not put it on. In the Bible nakedness is a shame. It is something forbidden by the Scripture. This is the result of the second fall of man.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Altar Having No Steps</h2><p>When God instituted the law at Mount Sinai in Exodus, He commanded the Israelites to build an altar with no steps because He did not want their bodies to be exposed when they went up the steps to offer sacrifices. God abhors the principle of exposure. He does not want man to expose his body. Other than the hands, feet, and head, every part of the body must be covered, and the hands, feet, and head must be covered with the blood. The modern trend of exposing one's body is a violation of God's original principle. God's original purpose is for man to cover himself with clothing. Even when he goes up to the altar to offer sacrifices, he should not expose his body. It is not right for man to be without covering.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Priest Wearing a Long Robe and Breeches</h2><p>The priests' garments were very fine. They were sewn with fine needlework, which allowed for no opening in the seams. God did not permit them to expose themselves. The priests were not allowed to expose themselves in any way before God. Their ephod was especially long. In addition, they had to wear breeches, lest their body be exposed (Exo. 28:42). The Bible is consistent in its emphasis; clothing is for covering, not for exposure. This is one main characteristic of clothing.</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Garment Symbolizing Redemption<br />and the Lord Jesus Himself</h2><p>God uses the garment as a symbol of our redemption. It is also a symbol of the Lord Jesus Himself. We are clothed with God's salvation, and we are those who have put on Christ Jesus. We are those who have put on the new man. God does not want to see any openings or breaches among us. We are completely clothed with salvation, with Christ, and with the new man. Our whole being is covered by God. We are saved and clothed with salvation.</p><p>Each time we put on our clothing, our inner eyes need to be opened to Christ and salvation. Before we put on our garment, we were naked. We were not covered at all before God, and we could not hide from God's light or His judgment. Thank God! Today we are clothed. Before God we have put on His salvation and His righteousness. We have put on the garment which God has given to us. We have put on Christ and the new man. The completeness of the covering of our garment symbolizes the completeness of the covering we have received from the Lord. This significance must not be overlooked. How marvelous it is that God is merciful enough to cover us! We are completely covered before God.</p><p>The principle of clothing is for covering. Christians should not wear any clothing which does not cover them. Any garment which exposes one's body should be discarded. The purpose of clothing is for covering, not for exposing. No one should make or wear any clothing which is in the principle of exposure rather than covering. The principle of exposure is incompatible with the principle of a Christian.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Garments Plagued with Leprosy</h2><p>Second, Leviticus says that a man can be plagued with leprosy. A house and a piece of garment can also be plagued with leprosy. Much of today's clothing on earth, especially ladies' dresses, are plagued with leprosy. We must deal with the subject of clothing in a sober way.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Two Different Kinds of Dealings</h2><p>Leviticus 13 shows us two different ways to deal with a garment plagued with leprosy. Some garments had to be sent to the priest. The priest would examine the leprosy on them. If the leprosy grew and spread, the garment had to be burned; it had to be removed completely. It could no longer be used. In some cases leprosy may not have spread; the garment merely turned dark. The priest would then cut out part of the fabric and have the garment washed. If the leprosy remained, the garment had to be burned. After the priest washed the garment and cut off the undesirable parts, if the leprosy stopped, the garment could be spared.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Bringing Clothes to the Lord<br />and Dealing with Them One by One</h2><p>A new believer must pay attention to the matter of clothing. If you have any doubt about any of your clothes, you should bring them to the priest for examination. The Lord is the High Priest today. You must ask Him whether or not you can wear this clothing. Do not think that this is a small matter. Clothing is a big issue to a new believer. If you do not know which clothes are plagued with leprosy, you should bring them to the Priest and let the Lord tell you whether they are plagued.</p><p>Remember that a person has to separate himself from a leper. A house plagued with leprosy had to be torn down and a garment plagued with leprosy had to be burned. Of course, today you do not need to burn your clothing. But at least you must not wear those things anymore. There are many garments which are plagued with leprosy. Many of them can be worn again after the sleeves are lengthened and the dress dyed to a different color or changed to a different style. Some clothing can be kept after it is examined by the priest and altered a little. Some clothing has the nature of leprosy even after it is examined and altered. It must be thrown away. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he has to present his clothes piece by piece to the Lord and allow Him to examine each one in detail. He should let the Lord tell him whether or not the clothing is appropriate for him. All of it must be dealt with piece by piece.</p><p>I hope new believers will behave as Christians when they present themselves before men. I do not want to see anyone doubting a Christian's genuineness because of the kind of clothes he or she wears. Others will say whether or not we are Christians by the kind of clothes we wear. A cleansed person would never wear plagued clothing. Our leprosy has been cleansed and our sins are forgiven. From now on, we should not wear any leprosy-infested garments.</p><p>New believers must present everything in their wardrobe piece by piece to the Lord and pray over each item. Do not expect others to come and tell you what is good and what is not. You must bring everything to the Lord yourself and let the Lord judge you. You must ask the Lord, "I have become a believer now. Is this clothing all right? Is this clothing right?" Some items of clothing have to be thrown away, while others must be altered. Let the Lord teach you what to do. Some garments cannot be altered at all. You must decide for yourself whether sin is involved in a certain garment. Your clothing has much to do with you. This matter must be dealt with soberly.</p><h2 class="head3">3. A Clear Distinction<br />between Males and Females</h2><p>The Bible forbids men to wear women's clothing and vice versa (Deut. 22:5). The tendency today is to annul the distinction between men's and women's clothing. Already this distinction is becoming less and less. If the world continues this trend, there will soon be no difference between the two. All the brothers and sisters have to pay attention to this matter. Men should not wear women's clothing, and women should not wear men's clothing. You must maintain the separation established by God. Men must wear men's clothes and women must wear women's clothes. Anything which confuses the distinction in gender does not glorify God. God's people and His children must learn to have proper distinction in their clothing.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Sisters' Clothing</h2><p>Let us talk about the sisters' clothing first. Generally speaking, the matter of clothing is simpler with the brothers than with the sisters. The sisters' clothing poses more problems than the brothers' clothing. We will read two portions of the Word carefully.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Costly Apparel and Meekness</h2><p>First Peter 3:3-5 says, "Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God. For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves."</p><p>This is the only passage in the Bible that contains the phrase holy women. The phrase holy men is found in many portions of the Word. But this is the only place that speaks of "holy women." For in this manner the holy women adorned themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands. The holy women adorned themselves with a meek and quiet spirit.</p><p>Peter's word indicates that many sisters tended to adorn themselves with plaiting of hair, gold, and apparel. He did not feel happy about the way they dressed. The plaiting of hair and ornaments of jewelry are not suitable, nor is beautiful apparel. We are not saying that sisters should be careless in their clothing. If they are careless, it means that there is something wrong with their character. If a sister dresses herself in a careless, untidy, and unclean way, it means that she is a careless and loose person. This is not what Peter meant.</p><p>Peter was saying that it is wrong for women to plait their hair in the manner he described. The phrase plaiting of hair in the original text means to fashion the hair in many styles. Throughout history, many styles have been designed to plait the hair. Putting on of gold means to wear jewelry. Christians cannot do this. Clothing with garments may refer to colorful and stylish dresses. Peter's emphasis is that sisters should not adorn themselves with the plaiting of hair and the putting on of gold and costly garments. Instead, they should adorn themselves with a meek and quiet spirit.</p><p>Sometimes a woman dresses herself fancily yet has a temper like a lion. You cannot help but feel that her person is incompatible with what she wears. She would be better off not wearing fancy dresses at all. It is unfitting for a fancily dressed woman to shout in rage. If a woman is meek and submissive, she has put on good apparel already. A woman who serves God should not pay too much attention to her clothing. As Christians we should not place too much emphasis on clothing.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Proper Clothing with Modesty and Sobriety</h2><p>Let us look at 1 Timothy 2:9-11: "Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works. Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection."</p><p>One of God's basic requirements for the sister is modesty. It is good to feel modest and to be conscious of shame. This is a natural protection for the sisters. Sisters who are conscious of shame and who are modest are protected naturally. Do not wear dresses which are contrary to your sense of shame. You must exercise sobriety. Do not wear immodest clothes. Immodesty is contrary to sobriety. Always wear "proper clothing." Every sister knows what is proper in her particular community. We should always wear clothes which are considered proper by those around us. A Christian should not wear clothes which provide an opportunity for heathens to say, "Do Christians wear such things too?" Our standard must never be lower than that of the heathens'. We must learn to have modesty and sobriety and must know what constitutes "proper clothing."</p><p>Verse 9 continues: "Not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing." This particularly refers to the curling of hair. Peter was referring to the many fashions that women apply to their hair. Curling the hair means making many curls like clusters of vines. Women were already concerned with fashion two thousand years ago. Today many think that it is fashionable to curl their hair into clusters. Actually, this is something very ancient; it was being done two thousand years ago. Costly clothing is spoken of here as well. Some dresses have the same value but are priced differently. We should not wear the costly ones or spend extra money on them.</p><p>Sisters must take care of propriety in their clothing. We have no intention, nor did Paul or Peter, to ask a sister to be careless, loose, or unconcerned about her attire. Neither should we set our mind on fancy dresses and costly clothing. Sisters should wear proper clothing; they should learn to manage their wardrobe properly. They should set their wardrobe in proper order, using ordinary material at reasonable cost. No sister should be unconcerned about the way she attires herself.</p><p>Some sisters spend too much time on their clothing. They pay too much attention to fancy clothes and costly dresses. Other sisters do not care for the tidiness and the cleanliness of their attire; they are very careless about their clothing. This shows that they are sloppy. A woman's dress is a true reflection of her character. If one does not pay attention to personal grooming and cleanliness, such a person is loose, sloppy, and careless. Our clothing must be proper, neat, and clean. It must be simple, but clean.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Seal of the Holy Spirit upon One's Clothing</h2><p>Leviticus 8:30 says that, according to the command of God, "Moses took some of the anointing oil...and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him." Thus, our clothing must be sealed with the mark of holiness. There should be the seal of the Holy Spirit, the seal of the anointing oil, on our clothing. When one is anointed, his garment is also anointed, and both are sanctified together.</p><p>In Numbers 15:38 God also commanded the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments and put a cord of blue upon the tassel of each corner. Blue is the color of heaven. This serves to remind men of the heavenly things. A believer's clothing must have a heavenly taste to it. It must not express the world. Do not follow the world in its freedom and fancy. We should have the expression of heaven in our clothing. Our clothing, as well as ourselves, should be fully sanctified.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Principles Concerning Clothing</h2><h2 class="head4">a. Personal Freedom</h2><p>I would like to say a general word according to my personal opinion on clothing. I am not saying that every child of God should dress the same way. I have no intention to ask all the sisters to ignore outward beauty altogether. I am not saying that all the brothers and sisters should use the cheapest fabric and the worst materials for their clothing. The Bible has no such commandment. When John came, he was clothed with camel's skin. But when the Lord Jesus came, His undergarment was a seamless garment, the best of the time. There is one basic principle of Christian clothing&mdash;God has given everyone the freedom to wear what he likes. We are free to choose the materials we like and to pick the style we prefer.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Not Attracting Attention</h2><p>However, we should take note of one thing: No one should wear anything that draws attention to his clothes rather than to his person. No Christian should do this. If our clothing always draws others' attention to us, there is something wrong with it. What we wear should express our being. If I put a bouquet of flowers into a vase and others only pay attention to the vase, something is wrong with the vase. Clothing is meant to express the person. Our clothing should not usurp who we are. The worst thing would be for us to wear clothing that draws attention away from our person to our appearance. This is a great mistake.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Clothing Needing to Match One's Status</h2><p>Another matter needs special attention: A person's clothes should match his status. Do not dress too poorly and do not dress too well. Please bear in mind that poor clothing attracts attention in the same way that fancy clothing does. We should not pay that much attention to our clothing, neither should we draw the attention of others to it. It is wrong to give others the impression that we are particularly well dressed. However, it is also wrong to be so poorly dressed that others begin to feel uneasy about us. Our clothing must match our status. Others should not feel that we are too much or too poor in our attire. Our clothing must glorify the Lord.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Clothing Not Arousing Self-consciousness</h2><p>Furthermore, our clothing should not arouse our own consciousness. Some people are always conscious of what they wear. This means that something is wrong with their attire. They have become a coat hanger to their clothes, and their clothes have become more important than they are. They are not wearing their clothes. Instead, their clothes are wearing them. They are always conscious of what they are wearing. They pay too much attention to their appearance. This means that their dress is either too good or too poor. When a person is poorly dressed, he becomes conscious of his clothes in the company of others. When he wears fancy attire, he becomes conscious of his clothes as well. Both are wrong.</p><p>It is best to wear something which does not arouse your attention or the attention of others. Your clothes should be very ordinary. At the same time, it should match your status and should be worthy of Christ. Anything that goes beyond this limit is improper. It is a great thing to present a Christian testimony in our attire today. This means that others can identify us as Christians by our appearance.</p><h2 class="head1">II. FOOD</h2><p>Let us come next to the matter of food.</p><p>In Genesis 2 God gave man food to sustain his life. This happened before man sinned. The matter of food is found as early as Genesis 2. Clothing began in Genesis 3, but food began prior to man's fall. God ordained that man should partake of fruits of every kind. Before man sinned, the God-ordained food for man was fruit.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Need for Meat after the Fall</h2><p>In Genesis 3, after man fell, God gave man herbs for food and ordained that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face. This was God's food for man in Genesis 3. When we come to Genesis 4, God put His seal of approval upon Abel but not Cain, even though no ordinance of any kind had yet been instituted. Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a keeper of sheep. Abel shepherded sheep, and God's seal of approval was upon him. He offered sacrifices to God, and God accepted him. Cain was a tiller of the ground. He brought the produce of the land to God, but God did not accept his sacrifice. Genesis 4 does not say anything about God's will. But when we come to Genesis 9, God gave the animals to man for food (v. 3), just as He had given fruit to man for food in the beginning.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Sacrificing Life to Preserve Life</h2><p>Why did God give animals to man for food? First, this indicates that man has a need for food. But this is not all. Man's need for food before the fall was different from his need for food after the fall. We must understand the meaning of food. Food sustains our life. If a man does not eat, he will die. No one can live and survive without eating. In addition to eating herbs, vegetables, and fruits, God ordained that man should take meat in order to live and survive. In other words, God shows us that after sin entered the world, life must be sacrificed to preserve life. There is the need for an animal to lose its life to maintain our life. After sin entered this world, there was a need for the shedding of blood to maintain life. This is the reason that man's food after the fall is different from his food before the fall. Christians should not be vegetarians; they should be free to take meat.</p><p>This does not mean that meat will necessarily do our body any good. Whether or not it is good for our body is a different thing. We are not medical researchers. Researchers claim that animal protein is better than vegetable protein. The basic principle with us is that since sin has entered the world, man can no longer have life without the sacrifice of life. After man sinned, he could no longer receive life without death. Life can only come through death. Without death, man cannot live. In order for man to live, there is the need for the shedding of blood. When we have death, we have life. This is the basic principle of eating after the fall.</p><p>Since the time of Abel, and in particular after the flood, God placed this way before men. Being a vegetarian is a subconscious declaration that we can live without death, that we can live without the shedding of blood. By eating meat, we are indicating that we cannot live without death and the shedding of blood. Is this principle clear? This is the reason that God gave animals to man for food after the flood. Man can no longer have life without the loss of life. Thank God! Christ gave up His life. Now we can receive life.</p><p>Romans 14 indicates that some people still believed that they could be vegetarians like Adam before the fall. Some of them only ate vegetables. Paul told us not to criticize these ones. He told us not to stop them or to condemn them. Those who eat meat should not judge those who do not, and those who do not eat meat should not judge those who do. However, Paul pointed out one thing: Those who only eat vegetables are weak (v. 2). Do not criticize them for their weakness. But this does not mean that vegetarianism is right. It only means that we do not want to embarrass others over the matter of food.</p><p>However, we must realize that Christian redemption involves life out of death. Before there can be life, there must first be death. Vegetables alone are not enough; death must precede life. Life is sustained through death. This is a fundamental Christian principle. Some may be weak in their conscience and may only eat vegetables. We should not expose their weakness. But a Christian's stand is that meat is needed because it sustains life.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Abstinence from Foods<br />Being the Teachings of Demons</h2><p>First Timothy 4 says that there will be the teachings of demons that forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods (vv. 1, 3). D. M. Panton has shed some clear light on this. He said that only by abstaining from marriage and foods can one's soul power be developed. We must realize that we are not those who abstain from meat. In the last days there will be such things as abstinence from foods. This is the teaching of demons; it is not the teaching of the Lord. Some abstain from meat because they do not know the Christian principle of life through death. Eating only vegetables means that one's life is maintained by the vegetable life alone and that he has no need of a Savior, no need of death, and no need of salvation. We must be clear about this principle.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Taking Blood</h2><p>Second, there is one thing which Christians should not take&mdash;blood.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Taking of Blood Being Forbidden<br />in Three Dispensations</h2><p>Abstinence from blood is a consistent teaching throughout the Bible. When God spoke to Noah in Genesis 9, He forbade men from taking the blood of the animals (v. 4). Taking blood was something forbidden by God.</p><p>Leviticus 17:10-16 clearly and repeatedly says that man should not eat the blood of any beast. God did not allow His people to eat animal blood. Whoever ate blood would be cut off by God; He would not recognize such a one as one of His people.</p><p>In the New Testament we find the record of the first council in Jerusalem in Acts 15, in which the church met to settle the great issue of the law. James, Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and other apostles of the Lord decided that God's children should be free from the law, but at the same time that they should abstain from sacrifices offered to idols, from fornication, and from blood.</p><p>Blood is something that bears a great significance, not only during the time of Noah and in Leviticus, but also at the time of the book of Acts. In the dispensation of the patriarchs, God forbade Noah from taking animal blood. In the dispensation of the law, God spoke through the mouth of Moses and forbade the same thing. In the dispensation of grace, God banned the same thing through the apostles. This matter is forbidden in all three dispensations. Blood is not to be taken in the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, or the dispensation of grace.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Drinking Only the Blood of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>There must be a reason for this observance. Men of the past did not understand this, but one day God's Son came to the world and pronounced that He was the bread from heaven and that He came to be man's food. Many did not know what He meant. He said that His flesh was true food and His blood was true drink. The Lord repeated over and over again in John 6 that His blood was the true drink and that a man must drink His blood before he can receive His life. He also said that unless a man drank His blood, he would not have life in himself. Those who drink His blood will be raised up in the last day and will receive life from Him. The Lord repeated this many times.</p><p>This is a marvelous thing. All three of the basic dispensations in the Bible forbid the eating of blood. Yet Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, said, "My blood is true drink" (v. 55). He charged men to take His blood. Do you see this? God forbids us from eating the blood of animals, yet those who take the Lord's blood are saved. What does this mean? This means that after one takes the Lord's blood, he cannot take any other kind of blood. There is only one kind of blood which we can take.</p><p>In other words, God's ordinance regarding abstinence from blood tells us that there is only one redemption and one salvation. We cannot have another redemption besides this one. We cannot have another salvation besides this one. Only the blood of Jesus of Nazareth can be taken. All other blood is forbidden. The Lord's blood signifies redemption. It also signifies salvation. Rejecting other kinds of blood means that we reject other kinds of salvation. I know of no other salvation except the salvation of Jesus. There is only one kind of blood for me, not two. Only one kind of blood can save me. I will not accept any other blood.</p><p>This may be a small thing to you, but it is one of our many crucial testimonies. As Christians, we bear many testimonies. This is one of them. Other religions may ask why we do not take animal blood. We have to tell them that we have already taken blood. By not taking other blood, we make a strong testimony before men. We do not take other blood because we have taken one kind of blood. We have taken this blood; therefore, we cannot drink any other blood. The blood of Jesus of Nazareth is our only redemption. We can no longer accept any other redemption. We have already accepted the Lord's redemption, and we have rejected all other ways of salvation. This is why we do not take animal blood.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Eating Things Strangled</h2><p>In Leviticus 17, as well as in other portions of the Old Testament, there is also an ordinance against eating strangled animals. Acts 15 says that anything strangled should not be eaten. This is also related to the blood. The blood of a strangled animal is not separated from the meat. We do not take other blood because we maintain that there is only one salvation in the universe. This is reason that God's children should reject all other blood; they should not eat it at all.</p><h2 class="head2">C. There Being No Difference<br />between the Clean and the Unclean Today</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Unclean Animal Being Forbidden<br />in the Old Testament</h2><p>In Leviticus 11 God gave the Israelites a list of clean beasts which they could eat and a list of unclean beasts, such as creeping things, which they could not eat. Some fish in the sea are edible, while others are not. Similarly, some fowls in the air are edible, while others are not. Carnivorous birds are not edible. Fish that have fins and scales are edible, while those that do not have fins and scales are not. Leviticus contains a list of ordinances regarding what is clean and what is unclean, and what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten. This list encompasses fish in the sea, birds in the air, creeping things, and beasts on earth.</p><p>Many have pondered on the significance of the regulations in Leviticus 11. Should the New Testament believers keep the same regulations? Let us turn to Acts 10. As Peter was praying on the housetop, a trance came upon him and he saw heaven opened. A certain vessel like a great sheet descended, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. These were all forbidden by God in Leviticus 11. God said to Peter, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!" (Acts 10:13). Peter was a Jew; he had kept the law. He said to the Lord, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean" (v. 14). Then a voice came to him the second time, saying, "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common" (v. 15). This occurred three times. Afterward, the vessel was immediately taken up into heaven.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Matter of Choice in the Old Testament</h2><p>We need to realize that the ordinances in Leviticus 11 give us a hint of the teaching in Acts 10. God's mind is not on what kind of fish one can eat; His mind is not on what kind of animal one can eat. Did God not think of such things when He gave all the living creatures to Noah for food? In Noah's time there was no distinction between clean and unclean; everything could be eaten. Why then was there a distinction of the clean and unclean in Leviticus 11? During Noah's time God had not made a choice concerning His own people on earth. By the time of Leviticus, however, God had made a choice&mdash;He had chosen Israel. The Israelites came out of Egypt and were chosen to be God's people. Hence, there was a separation between God's people and those who were not His people. God did not raise the matter of choice during the time of Noah. The matter of clean and unclean only occurred at the time of the exodus when there was a separation between the Jews and the Gentiles. The question of who were God's people and who were not became an issue at that time. From that time forward, there was a distinction between clean things which were edible and unclean things which were not edible. One group of people could enter the fellowship, while the other group could not. God was pleased with one group of people but not with the other. Food became a symbol of this distinction. Food is not merely food; it is something that shows a principle. Edible things indicate things that are pleasing to God, while forbidden things indicate things that are not pleasing to God.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Unclean Animals Being Edible Today</h2><p>After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, God told Peter to rise up, slay, and eat. From that time forward, God's grace came upon the unclean Gentiles. Today everyone can be chosen. What God considered as unclean in the Old Testament is considered clean in the New Testament. Leviticus 11 is overruled. Today the Israelites are not the only ones who are God's people; both the Gentiles and the Israelites are now God's people. Ephesians 2 shows that both Gentiles and Jews have come to God. The two have become one and can receive grace together.</p><p>God told Peter three times: "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common" (Acts 10:15). These words explained the vision. Those from the house of Cornelius knocked at the door as soon as the vision went away. When Peter went down, he began to understand the vision he had seen on the housetop. He realized that the Gentiles were also entitled to grace. Spontaneously, he took some brothers with him to the house of a Gentile. Later, as he was testifying, God manifested His grace to the Gentiles even as He had to the Jews.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Our Testimony Being Different<br />from That of the Jews</h2><p>Our testimony differs from that of the Jews. Today the Jews are God's people, and the Gentiles are also God's people. If we refrain from eating some things, we are saying that the Jews are God's people but that we are not. The commandment today is to rise up, slay, and eat. We should no longer just eat clean things and refrain from eating unclean things. What God considers clean, we must not consider unclean.</p><p>We eat both the clean and the unclean to testify to the fact that both the Jews and the Gentiles are now God's people. In the Old Testament, only clean things were eaten, which meant that only the Israelites were God's people. It was right to eat only one kind of food during that time. It is also right to eat both kinds today. Today we are not standing on the ground of Leviticus 11. Rather, we stand on the ground that the Gentiles and the Jews have received grace together and that God has abolished all distinctions between them. Our food is a testimony to this fact.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Not Eating Things Sacrificed to Idols</h2><p>Fourth, 1 Corinthians has much to say concerning things sacrificed to idols.</p><p>First Corinthians 8 tells us that idols mean nothing. God is God, and idols are just vanity. To those who are advanced in knowledge, it is all right to eat things sacrificed to idols since idols are nothing. There may be evil spirits behind the idols, but God is much greater than the evil spirits. He who dwells in us is greater than he who is in the world.</p><p>Nevertheless, many new believers worshipped idols in the temple in the past. They had dealings with the idols, and they are ignorant of the meaning of fellowship with demons. If they see someone who has knowledge eating in the temple, they will think that they can do the same as well. The conduct may be the same, but the condition of the heart may be different. You eat because you realize that idols are vanity, but it is wrong for them to eat, because in their hearts the idols are something. You may cause them to sin if you are careless about your eating.</p><p>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 8 that it is better for believers not to eat things sacrificed to idols, because this will stumble the weak brothers. It is better not to eat such things at all. Paul considered those who ate only vegetables to be weak. But 1 Corinthians says that it is better to refrain from things offered to idols. We have to catch the emphasis of the writer here. God's children must know that idols are vanity and nothing. But they should not cause others to be stumbled through them. This being the case, it is better not to eat things sacrificed to idols at all.</p><p>This principle has nothing to do with demons; it has to do with the weak brothers. We must be clear about this. Many are concerned about the demons; they are the weak ones. We do not eat because we do not want to stumble our brothers, not because of the demons. Satan has no power over us. Idols have no power over us. We are not afraid of demons. But before God we must learn to care for our brothers. I do not eat because I do not want to stumble my brothers.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Personal Opinion</h2><p>Finally, I will give a word of personal opinion. Eating means a great deal in the Bible. We should keep this significance in mind.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Food Being for the Sake of Nourishing the Body</h2><p>Food, like clothing, is governed by certain principles. The first principle concerning food is that it is for the nourishment of the body. We should eat more of that which nourishes and less of that which does not nourish us. We should never make the belly our god or spend too much energy on food. As God's children, we must realize that food is for the nourishment of the body and for the preservation of our physical life.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Contentment and Addition</h2><p>God's children should be content with food and clothing. The birds of heaven do not sow, neither do they reap, yet God feeds them. This has to do with eating. The lilies of the field toil not, neither do they spin, yet they are better clothed than Solomon. This has to do with clothing. Everything is in God's hand. Today we need only to seek God's kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to us (Matt. 6:26-33). I like the word added. What is the meaning of added? If I ask, "How much is three plus zero?" you would say, "It does not make sense to add zero to three. It makes no sense to add zero to anything. Zero plus three is redundant." What can you add to a number? It only makes sense to add a positive number to something. For example, you can add one to three. You should seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. This means that to those who have God's kingdom and His righteousness, God will add food and clothing. I hope that all the brothers and sisters will seek God's kingdom and His righteousness. To those who have God's kingdom and who live in God's righteousness, the rest will be added to them. I hope that God's children will know how to maintain a proper testimony among men in the matter of clothing and food.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">ASCETICISM</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE ORIGIN OF ASCETICISM</h2><p>All unsaved persons have certain ideals. Although a person may live in sin, he still cherishes certain lofty ideals. He has a concept about what constitutes a holy living. Although he cannot live that way, he considers it as his standard for a holy living. It is interesting to note that although many unbelievers indulge in sin and lust, they have an idealistic concept of what constitutes a holy life. They think that if they can achieve such a state one day, they will be holy persons and will be beyond earthly contamination.</p><p>All intellectual people have an idealistic picture of what constitutes a holy living. Even with less educated and less sophisticated people, there is a concept that a person is good and noble if he achieves a certain standard.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being of the World, Not of Christianity</h2><p>We brought this kind of thought into the church when we were saved. We have the concept that as Christians we should now achieve the ideal living which we failed to achieve before. In the past we lived in sin, grew up with lust, and had no power over the weaknesses of our flesh. Now that we have believed in the Lord, we should live out an ideal life. But here lies man's basic frustration: He thinks that he can live his version of an ideal life. He does not realize that this ideal life belongs altogether to the world; it has nothing to do with being a Christian. Please bear in mind that even though many people have become Christians, their standard is still a heathen standard. Their ideal life is a heathen ideal. They bring their philosophies into the church. Such philosophies pose quite a problem to a Christian. A new believer must deal with this matter in a clear and definite way.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Originating from a Desire to Be Free<br />from Lustful Living</h2><p>What is this ideal life that man aspires to? Simply put, a man bound by sin is filled with all kinds of lust and greed. Although he can do nothing about them, he yearns to be free from them. On the one hand, his heart is drawn toward material things. On the other hand, he yearns to be delivered from these material things. Man's ideals are always based on what he cannot do. The more he is bound by something, the more he yearns for the opposite thing. The more lusts a man has, the more his ideals are shaped by the desire for deliverance from these lusts. The more a man lusts for material wealth, the more he aspires to be freed from material wealth. The whole world is filled with asceticism of one form or another. Please bear in mind that asceticism is not man's rule of conduct, but an ideal that he cherishes. With this ideal, man mollifies himself. This ideal affords man a goal, an excuse to forget about himself. He sets a certain standard and goal, telling himself that if he attains to this standard, he will have reached the ultimate pinnacle of attainment. This is the source of asceticism.</p><p>Almost all unbelievers yield to lust, but in their hearts they admire those who are freed from lust and from material bondage. Hence, asceticism is a standard and an ideal that an unbeliever, that is, a man without Christ, sets before himself.</p><h2 class="head1">II. ASCETICISM HAVING NO PLACE IN CHRISTIANITY</h2><p>After a person is saved, he subconsciously carries this thought of asceticism into the church. Though he never practiced it in the past, he admired those who practiced it. Gentiles indulge in lusts on the one hand and admire asceticism on the other hand. They crave material things, yet they admire those who are free from material things. They cannot be a certain way, yet they admire those who are that way. After they become Christians, they carry their privately cherished ascetic ideals into the church, thinking that it is the duty of a saved person to practice asceticism.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Asceticism<br />Being the Denial of Material Things<br />and the Suppression of Lust</h2><p>What does asceticism mean? To many people, it means the denial of outward material things. The less they have to do with outward material things, the better they think they are. They are afraid that outward material things feed their inner lust. All ascetics admit that all kinds of lust reside in man. From the lust for food to the lust for sex, every kind of lust resides in man. These lusts control the conduct of almost everyone on earth. Many think that in order to be holy, they have to overcome these lusts. Outwardly speaking, asceticism is a denial of material things. Inwardly speaking, asceticism is the suppression of one's own lusts. They hope that they can become holy by depriving lust of any form of expression.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christians Not Advocating Asceticism</h2><p>However, we must realize that a Christian should never advocate asceticism. If a Christian advocates asceticism, he is practicing something very superficial indeed. Let us read some portions of the Word. Many people try to suppress themselves in the matters of food, lust, or other material things. They think that this is Christianity and that this is the ideal life of a Christian. But the Bible shows us that asceticism has no place in Christianity.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST AND BEING FREED<br />FROM THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WORLD</h2><p>Colossians 2:20-23 says, "If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch, (regarding things which are all to perish when used) according to the commandments and teachings of men? Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and lowliness and severe treatment of the body, but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh."</p><h2 class="head2">A. A Fundamental Fact&mdash;<br />Crucifixion with Christ</h2><p>Paul said to the Colossian believers, "You died with Christ." Paul considered this a fundamental Christian fact. Christians are those who have died with Christ. The New Testament shows us that every Christian has died with Christ. Romans 6:6 tells us that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Galatians 2:20 also says that we have been crucified with Him. Galatians 5:24 shows us that our flesh with its passions and lusts has been crucified with Christ. The Bible repeatedly says that Christians are those who are crucified with Christ. In other words, the cross of Golgotha is the cross of Christians. The Christian life begins with the cross. It begins not only with Christ's cross, but also with one's own cross. The cross of Christ became our cross when we accepted it. A person is not a Christian if he has not accepted the fact of the cross. If he is a Christian, he has claimed the reality of the cross of Christ as his own. In other words, he has died in Him.</p><p>Paul had no doubt about the reality of the cross of Christ. He did not question this fact at all. He took it as the basis of his argument. In effect, he was saying, "Since you have died with Christ, certain things will happen." Brother Ting is sitting here with us. Since the fact that his name is Ting is indisputable, we can make some statements based on this fact. If the statements are based on an indisputable fact, the statements will also be indisputable: "Since your name is Ting, I can say this and that." Paul was giving a conclusion based on a fact.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Freedom from the Philosophies of the World</h2><p>"If you died with Christ from the elements of the world" (Col. 2:20). No philosopher can be a philosopher from inside his own tomb. Anyone who desires to talk about philosophy must be alive. We must realize that philosophy is dead; it is on the cross and has been dealt with fully. It should no longer be living. Everything about lust and materialism is in the realm of philosophy. Human thoughts are always preoccupied with lusts and material things. Man thinks that holiness will come when a person is freed from all material influence and sexual lusts. This is nothing but a kind of worldly philosophy. Paul told us that if we died with Christ, we are freed from the philosophy (the elements) of the world, and this problem does not even exist.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Why, as Living in the World</h2><p>Paul continues in verse 20: "If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances?" If you have died, and death is a fact, you should no longer be as those living in the world. The fundamental position of a Christian is death.</p><p>Why were we baptized if we were not dead? Does a person die first or is he buried first? A man must be dead before he can be buried. If a man is buried and then dies, a living person has been buried. We must first die before we can be buried. We were baptized; baptism was our burial. We were buried because we had been crucified with Christ. Our crucifixion with Christ is a fact, and our burial followed as our own voluntary act. The Lord has included us in His death. When we see our death and know that we are dead, we ask others to bury us. We must first realize that we are dead before we can ask others to bury us, that is, to baptize us. Since we are dead and buried, how can we still live according to the elements of the world?</p><p>Paul told us that those who practice asceticism are still living according to the elements of the world. He said, "Why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch?" Please bear in mind that this is the philosophy of ascetics. There are many things which they cannot taste, handle, or touch. Many people are fearful of their inward lust. This is why they dare not handle, touch, or taste many things. Colossae was a place where asceticism flourished. The Colossians observed many different kinds of ordinances. Because they feared that their lust would be aroused, they prohibited anything that might arouse it. There were all kinds of strict ordinances, some having to do with what one could not handle or touch, and others having to do with what one could not taste or hear. This was done in the hope that these ordinances would separate lust from material things. The prevailing philosophy of the time was that lust would be held in check if it was separated from material things. If there was nothing for lust to feel and touch, the Colossians thought that it would shrivel away.</p><p>But Paul said, "Why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch?" Those who observed these ordinances did not believe in the fact that they had been crucified with Christ. What prohibition is needed if one believes that he is already dead? He only needs a prohibition on handling, tasting, and touching if he is not dead. The need for asceticism is for those who are still alive. Those who are already dead have no need of asceticism.</p><p>Please remember that we have crucified the flesh and its passions and lusts with Christ on the cross (Gal. 5:24). If we try to put ourselves into bondage again by such thoughts of material abandonment and denial of lusts, we are not standing on Christian ground; we are not standing on the ground of death. No one can be a Christian without passing through death. We cannot be Christians without dying with Christ. If we do not include ourselves on the cross, we are not Christians. We must never be deceived in this matter.</p><p>Although many of us preach the doctrine of the cross, we still do not know what crucifixion with Christ means. I heard the doctrine of crucifixion with Christ as early as the latter part of 1919. At that time I did not understand anything about it. Later in 1923, I began to speak about crucifixion with Christ. At that time I saw that our crucifixion with Him was a fact, not a teaching. Crucifixion is a fact to us. Today many people are still seeking to be crucified. But we have to see that crucifixion is our starting point; it is not our finishing point. Making crucifixion the goal of one's pursuit is the practice of the mystics; it is not a Christian teaching. Crucifixion is our starting point. We are Christians because we have died with Christ. Please bear in mind that no one can pursue crucifixion. Doing so is foolishness; it only proves that we have not seen any light. If we have seen the light and touched the truth of crucifixion, we will praise God for it rather than pursue it. This is like the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus; when we see it, we will praise Him for it, instead of pursuing it.</p><p>Here Paul shows us that a Christian is a person who has died with Christ. He is freed from the philosophy of the world and its ordinances of prohibition. As an illustration, suppose we bury a man who was a thief. We can stand beside him and proclaim that he will no longer steal; he has been freed from stealing because he is dead. He has also been freed from the commandment that forbids stealing. Suppose one is a talkative person. If he has died with Christ, he has been freed from his talkativeness. If he is not dead, nothing will avail, even the practice of asceticism. If Christ has already crucified us, it is too late for asceticism to do anything. God crucified us with Christ on the cross. We are freed from the philosophy of the world and thus are freed from all the ascetic works of this world.</p><h2 class="head2">D. According to the Commandments<br />and Teachings of Men</h2><p>Colossians 2:22 says, "According to the commandments and teachings of men." All ordinances and commandments related to asceticism are instituted and taught by men. They come from the human mind and are altogether of men. They have nothing to do with the church and nothing to do with Christ. Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God.</p><p>Paul spoke a very serious word here. He showed us that these commandments and teachings are of man, not of God. They are man's concept of an ideal life. They are merely human concepts, consisting of nothing but idealistic ordinances that have nothing to do with God. It is strange that the world loves asceticism so much. Since all men need food, man thinks that those who deny it must be very noble: "While everyone is under the influence of material things, this person seems to be free from everything. He does not even have any use for material things. How great he is!" But we have to realize that asceticism is a natural religion; it is not Christianity, which comes from revelation. Natural religion involves the teachings and commandments of men. These teachings are wholly from men; they have no enlightenment or revelation. They are man's reaction to lusts. Man knows that lust is filthy, and his response to it is asceticism. Such teachings are of men; they are natural and not of God.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Perishing When Used</h2><p>What does Paul say concerning the effectiveness of asceticism? "Regarding things which are all to perish when used." Asceticism is pleasant to the ear; it appears to be a wonderful philosophy. But all you have to do is try it. It is like a car which does not break down at home but breaks down every time it is on the road. It is also like a dress which looks good in the show window but tears in different places as soon as a person puts it on. You can try it out and see for yourself. No one can control his lusts with asceticism.</p><p>The more you try to suppress yourself, the more your suppression exposes the busy activities within you. The more a man tries to escape, the more his fear of unchecked cravings is confirmed. A man can be so fearful that he dares not say anything or talk about anything. I have met a few of these so-called venerated men. I can testify that even though they carefully avoid many things, their words betray their helplessness with their lust. They keep fleeing and hiding. The more they flee, the more their flight exposes their deep-seated apprehension. Many people flee to the wilderness or lock themselves up. They try to shun the world. The power of the world is too great for them, and they can only run to the mountains and hide themselves.</p><p>Yet the world follows them to the wilderness and to the mountains. As long as they have not overcome the world within, they can never escape it by outwardly running away from it. Paul used a very special phrase here: Which are all to perish when used. They have no way to free themselves from their lusts. As soon as their lust catches up with them, they fall prey to it. They set up numerous rules to restrain themselves from touching, eating, handling, and seeing many things. They want to flee, to separate themselves, to leave the things of the world behind, and to break the chain of their own lusts. Yet those things are still present with them. The more a person fears, the more his bondage to the things he fears is exposed.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Giving Men a Reputation of Wisdom</h2><p>Paul says clearly in verse 23, "Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom." All ascetics and those who promote asceticism have a reputation of wisdom. They seek to have a name of wisdom in this world. Their arguments appear logical and wise, and people may be misled to think that these men are indeed men of wisdom.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Self-imposed Worship</h2><p>Paul criticized such ones for practicing "self-imposed worship" (v. 23). What are these ones like? They are, in reality, engaged in self-imposed worship. The expression self-imposed worship can be translated as "worship of the will." Paul said that these ordinances were a form of worship. They involve a worship of the will, not a worship of the Lord. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit (John 4:24). These ones, however, have no worship in spirit. They exercise their will to rule over themselves. Their religion is the religion of their will. The self-imposed worship spoken of by Paul is the religion of the will. This religion is produced by the will. Those who practice such worship say, "I will not eat; I will not touch; I will not listen; and I will not speak." Everything they do involves "I will." They exercise their will to practice their kind of worship.</p><p>Please bear in mind that this is not the Christian way. The Christian way is to contact God with the spirit. What distinguishes us from others is not a strong will that suppresses the lusts, but a strong spirit that touches God's grace. Our worship is our spirit touching the Spirit of God. The worship of ascetics is a suppression of lusts with the will. One is absolutely of God, while the other is totally of man. Self-imposed worship is a religion of the will.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Manmade Humility</h2><p>"Such things indeed have a reputation of...lowliness" (Col. 2:23). Such people show humility even toward themselves. They appear to be quite humble. There are many things which they will not touch, handle, hear, or see. It appears as if they are very humble. However, this humility comes from one's self. It is unnatural, artificial, and self-imposed; it is not spiritual humility which comes in a spontaneous way.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Severe Treatment of the Body</h2><p>What is their attitude toward themselves? It involves "severe treatment of the body" (v. 23). They care neither for eating nor for clothing their own bodies. They restrict their physical senses from seeing, touching, hearing, or handling anything. This is nothing but a "severe treatment of the body."</p><p>Ascetics believe that the body is evil. This teaching spread from Greece to India and then to China. The Chinese are not as extreme as the Indians and certainly not as extreme as some Greeks were. While not all Greeks were extreme, one school of Greek ascetics spread their teachings to India and later to China. They taught that the body is the root of all evil, and that if a man is freed from his body, he can be freed from sin. This is a fundamental concept of Buddhism concerning the "elements of the world." Buddhism reckons the body to be the root of all sin and that one can be freed from sin as soon as he is freed from the body. Since the body produces so many sins, they believe that one should afflict the body in the hope that the sufferings will reduce the sins. They think that it is right for the body to suffer; they think that it is right to deprive the body of every enjoyment; and they think that the more the body suffers, the better it is, because once it suffers, it will be free from sin. This is the result of the human religion of the will&mdash;"severe treatment of the body."</p><h2 class="head2">J. Not of Any Value</h2><p>What does a believer think of all these things? Paul said, "Such things...are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh" (v. 23). If a man thinks that he can suppress his own lusts by doing all these things, he is hoping for the impossible. This is because the Lord Jesus has already made the best provision on the cross for us. He has crucified our flesh with all of its passions and lusts on the cross. Today we stand under the cross and lay hold of its accomplished work to deal with the lusts of our flesh. This kind of dealing is different from the human way of dealing with one's lust. We deal with our flesh by acknowledging the reality of the cross of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Please bear in mind that just as man receives forgiveness of sins through the shedding of blood by the Lord Jesus, man is freed from his own lusts through His cross. The Lord's work includes both the shedding of blood as well as the application of the cross. We must see that after the shedding of blood by the Lord Jesus and the receiving of the cross, one must be baptized immediately. We ask to be buried because the Lord has crucified us. The Lord says that we are dead, and our response is baptism. We say, "Let me be buried." The Lord says that He has crucified us and that we no longer live. We respond by saying, "I do not doubt the fact of my death. Now I ask to be buried." Baptism is our recognition and acknowledgment of the Lord's death. If we still practice asceticism, it means that we are not standing in the position of death.</p><h2 class="head2">K. Seeking the Things Which Are Above</h2><p>Colossians 3:1-3 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above....Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God." Paul began with the cross and ended with resurrection. We are citizens of heaven. Therefore, we should not care for the things on earth. If we pay attention to what we should not touch, taste, or handle, we are setting our mind on the things of the earth. Paul went on to tell us that we are in resurrection. Since we are in resurrection, we should seek the heavenly things. If we take care of the heavenly things, earthly problems will disappear. A Christian should set his mind only on spiritual and heavenly things. He should not set his mind on what he should not eat, touch, or handle.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. ASCETICISM BEING A TEACHING OF DEMONS</h2><p>Christians should not pay attention to asceticism, because this is an error; it will introduce heathen doctrines into the Christian fold. We must deal with it in a thorough way.</p><p>We should read 1 Timothy 4:1-3, which says, "In later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to...teachings of demons...who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods." This also is asceticism. Asceticism will be greatly revived toward the end times. Men of one age may be materialistically inclined, but the next age will react against materialism and extol asceticism. What is asceticism? It is the forbidding of marriage and the abstinence from foods. These are things invented by the ascetics. They try to eliminate food and sex. Asceticism will come back to us in the end times.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />HUMAN NATURE AND HUMAN LUST</h2><p>As Christians we must understand the difference between human nature and human lust. Let us briefly cover these two things.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Urge Being from God</h2><p>God ordained that man should have food. He also gave man the urge for food. The urge for food was not a sin in the beginning, nor was it a lust. Man has the urge for food, and he eats to preserve his own life. God wants man to preserve his life. Therefore, when He gave food to man, He also gave man an urge for eating. God has no intention that man take his food without the sense of taste; He likes man to have enjoyment while he eats. Our enjoyment of food preserves and sustains our life. In the same way, God gave man the urge for sex for the purpose of reproduction and the continuation of human life. God gave man such an urge so that it would be a joy for man to continue human life. Please remember that no element of sin is involved in the urge for food or the urge for sex. In Genesis 2 these things had nothing to do with sin. Even today they have nothing to do with sin. We must be clear about God's view concerning these urges. These are urges created by God Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">B. What Lust Is</h2><p>What is lust? If I am hungry, I may eat. The enjoyment of that food, however, is not related to lust, but to the urge for food. However, if I have no food and I try to steal from others because I am hungry, that is lust. Or if I have food and indulge myself in the food, that also is lust. The desire for food is an urge, while the intention to steal food or the wanton indulgence in food is lust. There is a difference between an urge for food and a lust for food. Urge is the desire to eat; one feels happy while he eats. Lust is the intention to take food by stealing in a wanton way.</p><p>As Christians we eat when food is available and do not eat when food is not available. Not only should we not steal; we should not even have such a thought. This is the teaching of Matthew 5, which says that we should not have any lust for these things. It says that we should not even have any thought for these things. For example, I enjoy good food when it is available. This is related to the urge for food. This urge was created by God and is not sinful. When does a problem arise? It arises when I have nothing to eat and I see food. If I try to steal, my urge for food becomes a lust for food. If I start thinking about stealing, that is lust. This lust comes from my urge for food. Lust is simply the expression of one's urge to steal. The Old Testament says, "Thou shalt not steal" (Exo. 20:15). But in the New Testament, when Christians are hungry and without food, they should not only refrain from the act of stealing; they should not even have the thought of an such act. This is the principle of Matthew 5. The Old Testament forbids the act of stealing, whereas the New Testament forbids the thought of stealing. Stealing is lust, while the thought of stealing also is lust.</p><p>The same principle applies to the urge for sex. This is something that pertains to this age. While eating and drinking preserve the life of an individual, sex extends the life of the human race. Some people in the world steal when they have nothing. At least they contemplate stealing. Others indulge themselves in food. Both are lust. There is always the possibility that an urge for food and an urge for sex can turn into lust.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Cross Dealing<br />with the Passions and the Lusts</h2><p>Sex is right, and food is right, but both can turn into lust. This happens when there is an inordinate demand and obsession for these things. The Lord Jesus dealt with these things on the cross. He dealt with our flesh with its passions and lusts (Gal. 5:24). This is a great matter, a great gospel. The cross has dealt with our passions and our lusts. No Christian should steal or even contemplate stealing. We should be clean not only in our conduct but also in our thoughts. Although Christians recognize the existence of the flesh, they should be clean in their thoughts and conduct. The Lord has already accomplished this work for us on the cross.</p><h2 class="head2">D. God's Life Being Altogether Positive</h2><p>This does not mean that Christians do not need to deal with their lust. We are saying that the Lord has given us a new spirit and a new life. The new spirit enables us to touch God, and the new life enables us to express His life. God's life is altogether positive; there is nothing negative about it. This is not a matter of dealing with lust but a matter of seeing something positive. It has to do with the new life and the manifestation of God's life. There is a new spirit in us which is able to touch the Spirit of God. Christians are filled within with these positive things. We do not have to pay attention to such ordinances as "do not handle, nor taste, nor touch." We do not have to pay attention to the negative things, because we have the positive things with us. We must touch more of the positive things, the things in glory. We must keep touching the Spirit of glory and the life in glory. When we have the positive things, abstinence from eating, touching, and handling will become a minor issue. Everyone who is in the Lord should be fully released from these things.</p><p>Some people like to subject their physical body to asceticism because they are short of the positive things. Some Christians also have the same inclination. They would have nothing to cling to if asceticism were taken away from them. They constantly restrain themselves from seeing, handling, eating, touching, and listening to all kinds of things. If you take these ordinances away from them, you will take away their very world. This is their heaven and earth, their world, their universe. If you take away their universe, their world will be gone.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A FLEXIBLE ONE</h2><p>The Bible gives a very flexible view concerning such things as eating. It says one may eat or not eat. In God's eyes none of these things means anything; they are minor points, not major issues. All of these things are minor from the Scripture's point of view. The important and crucial things are the life of the Son of God and the life of Christ within the believers. With such glory and weight upon us, food and clothing become minor issues. The Bible shows us that the Christian life is a flexible life.</p><p>It is all right for anyone to dress himself moderately and to eat frugally before the Lord. But if someone gives him more to eat, he should feel free to take the offer; there is nothing wrong with eating more. If you feel that you do not want to marry for the Lord's sake, that is very good. If you feel that you are not doing justice to yourself by remaining single, it is good for you to marry. Some do not have as many riches of Christ, and you will be taking their world away from them if you take marriage away from them. But some have the riches of Christ, and they can go on undeterred. It is good to remain single, and it is good also to marry. These issues become very minor in comparison to that which is great and glorious. Any anxiety over these things shows one's little appreciation of Christ. The problems of marriage and food are very minor. Whether a Christian eats more or eats less is of minor concern. These are not the fundamental issues.</p><p>The crucial thing for us to do is to express the spiritual reality. All the other matters will spontaneously find their proper place if glory is properly expressed through us. If Christ's glory is not expressed, minor things will become major things, and we will apply asceticism to them. Those who do not know the Lord may cherish these things, but those who know the Lord will easily and effortlessly transcend them.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Neither a Matter of Eating and Drinking,<br />nor a Matter of Not Eating and Not Drinking</h2><p>Matthew 11:16-19 says. "But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn. For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard." Here we see that the Lord Jesus did not lay down any strict rules. He did not lay down stringent guidelines for outward Christian behavior. He said that John came neither eating nor drinking, while He came eating and drinking. This is the Christian way. Christians are not fettered by outward forms of eating and drinking. Both "eating and drinking" and "neither eating nor drinking" are right. These are not the basic issues. John lived in the wilderness, while the Lord Jesus attended the marriage feast in Cana. There was nothing unchristian about John's not eating, and there was nothing unchristian about the Lord Jesus' eating. Since we have the glorious things of Christ, everything else becomes a minor issue. Our concept has to be turned around. Do not dwell on the minor things. Do not make them the essential things of your life. Please bear in mind that a Christian is not one who eats and drinks, nor one who does not eat and drink.</p><h2 class="head2">B. We Can Do All Things as long as<br />We Are under the Discipline of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Philippians 4:11-13 says, "Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content. I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." Please bear in mind that a Christian can be abased or abound, filled or hungry, in abundance or in want. He can be filled, and he can be abased. We accept all discipline from the Holy Spirit. As long as it is under the Lord's sovereign arrangement, we can be hungry or filled. We can be in want or in abundance. In other words, we can be flexible in all things. In everything that we do, the Lord is the One who empowers us. This is the positive focus. Everything else is minor and insignificant.</p><p>I hope that you will learn this lesson before the Lord. This is what it means to have a flexible life. A Christian is neither an ascetic nor a glutton. Christians do not practice asceticism, and they do not practice indulgence. They live a flexible life. The outward living of a Christian is always governed by the discipline of the Holy Spirit, not by his own choice.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Transcendent, Not Ascetic</h2><p>Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 7:29-31 is very special in regard to how a Christian should live: "Those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away." This is a Christian. Outward things do not matter because the Lord who dwells in us is so much greater than these things. Man tries to suppress these things or to abstain from them. This only proves how strong these things are. The more a person practices asceticism, the more he is filled with lust. Only those who are filled with Christ have no need of asceticism. Those who have wives may be as though they had none. Those who do not have wives will not ask for them. It does not matter whether one weeps or rejoices. Those who buy are as those who do not possess, and those who use the world are as those who do not use it. Christians are transcendent over all things. The Christian life is not a life of asceticism but a life of transcendency. It transcends everything.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. NOT LOWERING THE STANDARD OF CHRISTIANITY</h2><p>Never think that Christianity is like asceticism. Do not be mistaken. Do not lower Christianity to the level of asceticism. Let us look at a few stories.</p><h2 class="head2"> A. Sadhu Sundar Singh</h2><p>Sadhu Sundar Singh was an Indian who preached the gospel for many years in Tibet. When he was in England he stayed in Keswick for half a year. I stayed in the same place in England once. I was told that the family which hosted him was quite embarrassed. While he was there, the weather was cold, and the family prepared a bed for him. Yet every night he slept on the floor, like a true Indian. However, we must remember that the Bible speaks of a life that can both sleep on the floor as well as on the bed. Many people do not have much within them. They would lose their Christian faith if they slept on a bed. Their Christianity consists of renouncing a bed. As a consequence, they lose their Christian faith when they sleep on a bed. Such heathen thoughts permeate China. We must see what a Christian is. Those who sleep on a bed are Christians, and those who sleep on the floor are also Christians. Those who sleep on a mud floor are Christians, and those who sleep on nice spring mattresses are also Christians. Never pay attention to outward things. Once we pay attention to these things, we will lower Christianity and degenerate its glorious spiritual life into ordinances. We must behold the things in glory and never quibble about the ordinances.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Preaching after Being Engaged</h2><p>One worker of the Lord who was somewhat inclined towards asceticism became engaged to a sister on a Saturday. Soon after his engagement, I met him and, quite amusingly, he said, "I felt very happy after I preached on the Lord's Day; I was surprised that I was able to preach after I was engaged." I asked, "Did you think you could no longer preach after you were engaged?" What kind of thought was this? He thought that his engagement one day would annul his preaching the next day. He was a good brother among us, but asceticism had unconsciously crept in. We must be on the alert and never allow asceticism to come in. There are many glorious things that we should apply ourselves to. Our Lord has resurrected from the dead, and He is now sitting in heaven. The brighter the light within us shines, the smaller other things will become to us. Under the overshadowing of such a great life, all other things become inconsequential.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Not Seeing His Wife<br />during the First Two Months of Marriage</h2><p>There was an old pastor who spoke highly of another pastor of Shantung. He told others that this person was wonderful because he left home to preach the gospel on the very day of his marriage. For two months he did not see his wife once. This is nothing but asceticism. If we read the Old Testament, a person cannot be a soldier during the first year of his marriage. The Bible cares much about this period. This has absolutely nothing to do with lust. Christianity is absolutely different from asceticism. Christianity's emphasis is not on these matters. The kingdom of God is neither eating nor drinking. Eating more or eating less means nothing. The kingdom of God has to do with the power of the Holy Spirit. To be concerned with what one should not eat or touch while being devoid of the power of the Holy Spirit is to be contaminated and captured by the things of the world. We must remember that Paul condemned such practices as sin. In the same way, we should condemn them as sin.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Working with an Overcoat</h2><p>Once two sisters from Shanghai were working in an area north of Yangtze. The weather was cold and they each had an overcoat. Some local ones criticized them, saying, "We doubt whether a woman can still work for the Lord when she has such a nice overcoat on." Many think that God's word can be bound by a mere overcoat. They think that once a person puts on a nice overcoat, he will no longer be able to preach. Christianity is not limited by an overcoat. No one should be affected by a mere coat to the point that the whole of his Christianity hinges on it. This is too poor.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. CHRISTIANITY TRANSCENDING ALL</h2><p>Please bear in mind that the Bible does not speak of this kind of suffering. If this were suffering for the kingdom, every rickshaw driver would enter the kingdom because they suffer more than we. We should not bring such concepts into our midst. These heathen thoughts must be excluded from us. Everyone who fears God should be indignant about such thoughts. We should have the feeling that the Lord's glory is being thrown to the dirt and the dust. We should regard such concepts as a usurpation of the glory of the Lord's life. I hope that we will pay attention to this matter. Christianity has nothing to do with quibblings about eating and drinking.</p><p>If the Christianity we preach consisted of nothing except eating, dressing, clothing, and beds, our preaching of Christianity would be tasteless. It would be the same as what the world preaches. Today I can climb to a mountaintop and shout, "My Christianity is different from your teaching. It has nothing to do with how to dress, how not to dress, what to eat, and what not to eat. It is different from your kind of joy and weeping, from your teaching on using worldly things and not using worldly things. My Christianity transcends everything. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and His glorious life dwell in me. Every day I am raptured to heaven to touch the glory of the throne." This is what Christianity is all about. All things will pass away and vanish before our eyes when God magnifies the greatness of these positive things to us. May we all see that Christians are not ascetics; they live a flexible life, because He who is in us is so great and so glorious.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">ILLNESS</h1><p>Concerning illness, there are a few things we need to consider before God.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ILLNESS BEING RELATED TO SIN</h2><p>Before man sinned, he had no sickness and was never ill. Man only became sick after he sinned. In a general sense, we can say that sickness, like death, comes from sin. Through one man's fall, sin and death came into the world. Just as death came upon all mankind through sin, so also sickness came upon mankind through sin. Although we did not personally commit Adam's sin, mankind, nevertheless, is fully identified with Adam. Death has come to all because of Adam's sin. Where there is sin there is death. Between sin and death, there is something called sickness. This is the cause of illness in general.</p><p>However, there are two different reasons a man becomes ill. One kind of illness comes from sin, while the other kind of illness does not come from sin; some sicknesses are not the result of sin. We have to separate the two kinds of sickness. There would surely be no sickness without sin, in as much as there would be no death without sin. There would not be any sickness if there were no death in this world. With sin comes death, and with death comes illness. There are many individuals whose illness is caused by sin, but there are others whose illness is not caused by sin. We need to understand the relationship between illness and sin as it pertains to individuals and to mankind in general.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Some Illnesses Being Caused<br />by Man's Sin against God</h2><p>In the Old Testament, namely in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, we find God protecting the Israelites and delivering them from illnesses whenever they obeyed Him, accepted His way, obeyed His law, and abstained from sin. Here God shows us clearly that some illnesses do come from disobedience and from sin.</p><p>In the New Testament, we also find some who became ill through sin. In 1 Corinthians 5:4-5 Paul spoke of his judgment to deliver one who sinned "to Satan for the destruction of his flesh." This shows us clearly that sickness can come from sins. If the sin is less serious, the result is sickness. If the sin is serious, the result is death. Second Corinthians 7:9-10 shows that Paul's desire was that through illness there would be repentance, not death. When the man repented with a repentance "which is without regret," Paul said that he should then be forgiven (2 Cor. 2:6-7). First Corinthians shows us that a person's flesh, not his life, was delivered to Satan. To deliver one's flesh to Satan means to cause him to become ill, not to die. This shows us clearly that the person became sick because of his sin.</p><p>Paul said that there were some in the church in Corinth who took the Lord's bread and drank His cup without discerning the Body. As a result, they became weak and ill and a number of them died (1 Cor. 11:29-30). Clearly, disobedience to the Lord was a reason for their sickness.</p><p>There is sufficient evidence in the Word to show us that many illnesses come from sin. However, this does not mean that all illnesses come from sin. Nevertheless, the first thing you should check when you are ill is whether or not you have sinned against God. Many people can tell you that they became ill because they sinned against God.</p><p>Among the brothers and sisters that I personally know, I can name over a hundred cases to prove my point. When they check the reason for their sickness, they find that many of their illnesses come from sin. Some have disobeyed the Lord in certain areas. Others have not kept His word and have taken a wrong turn in specific instances. When they discover their sin and confess it, their sickness goes away. Many brothers and sisters have experienced this, and I myself have experienced similar things. The moment we identify the reason for our sickness, the sickness is gone. This is something that medical science cannot explain.</p><p>Illnesses may not come from sins. However, like death, very often they are the result of sins. We can discover natural causes for many illnesses, but we cannot blame these natural causes for all of our sicknesses.</p><p>Often it is clear that a man's illness comes from sin. I remember a brother, a medical professor, who once told his students in the Shanghai Medical College in Chungking, "We found that there are natural causes for many kinds of illnesses. For example, staphylococcus, streptococcus, and pneumococcus cause a number of diseases. One kind of bacterium can produce several kinds of diseases. Different kinds of germs produce different kinds of illnesses. While doctors can discover the kind of germ that produces a certain kind of illness, we have no way of determining the reason that a germ infects one person but not another person. Ten people may enter the same room at the same time, and everyone can come into contact with the same germ. Some with good health may be infected, while others with poor health may not be infected. Normally, those who have poor health are more easily infected, and those who have good health are not as easily infected. But sometimes those with poor health are not infected, while those with good health are infected. Those who do not meet the conditions for infection are infected, while those who do meet the conditions for infection are not infected. There is no explanation for this!" He went on, saying, "We must admit that, besides natural causes, God's sovereignty is above everything." This is true. Often a person takes every precaution yet still becomes ill.</p><p>I still remember a classmate of mine who told me a story about his professor at the Peking University Medical College. The professor had a bad temper, but he was a very knowledgeable man. All the questions that he designed for his examinations were simple. One time he asked a very simple question: "Why does a person develop tuberculosis of the lungs?" Many students failed to give the right answer; they wrote, "Because there are tuberculosis germs." Every such answer was marked as wrong. Eventually he told the class, "The world is full of tuberculosis germs. Does this mean that everyone in the world will be infected?" He went on to explain, "Tuberculosis germs will incubate and develop into a case of tuberculosis of the lungs only under suitable conditions. You cannot say that tuberculosis of the lungs occurs simply because there is the presence of the germs." The students thought that as long as there were germs, there would be an illness. They forgot to point out that suitable conditions were necessary. This same thing is true when Christians become ill. There may be many natural causes for sickness, but God will allow a sickness to occur only when the right conditions are present. Without a certain environment, God will not allow any sickness to occur.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Seeking Forgiveness before Seeking a Cure</h2><p>We absolutely believe that there are natural causes for sickness. There are enough reasons and scientific proof to keep us from disputing the natural causes of sickness, but at the same time, we must acknowledge that many illnesses come upon God's children because of their sins. It is sin against God, as described in chapter eleven of 1 Corinthians, that brings about illnesses. With such cases, we need to ask God for forgiveness rather than for healing. A person must first seek forgiveness before he can ask for healing.</p><p>Often when a person becomes sick, he can quickly discover how he has sinned against the Lord, in what matter he has been disobedient, and where he has turned against His word. Once the sin is exposed, the sickness is gone. I have seen many people with such experiences. The illness stops when a certain issue is settled before the Lord. This is very strange. It is very important to discover the relationship between sin and illness. Sickness in general comes from sin. When a person is sick, he may have committed some specific sins.</p><h2 class="head1">II. SICKNESS AND THE LORD JESUS' WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Taking Away Our Infirmities<br />and Bearing Our Diseases</h2><p>Isaiah 53:4-5 says, "Surely He [Christ] has borne our sicknesses,/And carried our sorrows;/Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,/Smitten of God and afflicted./But He was pierced because of our transgressions;/He was crushed because of our iniquities;/The chastening for our peace was upon Him,/And by His stripes we have been healed."</p><p>Isaiah 53 is the most quoted chapter in the New Testament. This chapter speaks of the Lord as our Savior. Verse 4 says, "Surely He has borne our sicknesses,/And carried our sorrows." This verse is paraphrased in Matthew 8:17: "He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases." It is a translation of Isaiah 53:4. The Holy Spirit taught Matthew to describe the earthly Lord Jesus as One who took away our infirmities and bore our diseases. We need to note that He bore our sorrows and took away our infirmities before His death on the cross, while He was still on earth. This means that the Lord Jesus made healing His burden. He considered healing His business. His business was not only preaching the gospel but also healing diseases. He did not simply spread the gospel; He strengthened the weak, restored the withered hand, cleansed the leper, raised the paralytic, and He sent them home. He healed all kinds of diseases. While He was on earth, He gave Himself to preaching, as well as to the performing of miracles, to doing good, to training His disciples, to healing, and to the casting out of demons. We have to realize that the overthrowing of sickness that comes from sin is one of the Lord Jesus' commissions. The Lord Jesus came to the earth to deal with sins. He came also to deal with death and illness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Pardoning Iniquities and Healing Diseases</h2><p>Many of God's children are familiar with Psalm 103. I love to come back to this psalm again and again. David said, "Bless Jehovah, O my soul;/And do not forget all His benefits" (v. 2). What are His benefits? David said, "He pardons all your iniquities,/He heals all your diseases" (v. 3).</p><p>I would like to point out that sickness has two partners. One is death, and the other is sin. Sickness and death are a pair, and sickness and sin are another pair. We have seen that sickness and death are a pair. The result of sin is death, and because there is death, there is sickness. Both sickness and death are results. The intrinsic nature of sickness and death is the same&mdash;both came from sin. Psalm 103:3 shows us that sickness and sin (iniquity) are another pair. It says, "He pardons all your iniquities;/He heals all your diseases." Because my soul has sinned, there is sickness in my body. When the Lord deals with the sins in my soul and forgives them, the sickness in my body is healed. Our body is plagued on the one hand with inward sins, and on the other hand with outward illnesses. Today the Lord has removed both of them for us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Bearing of Sins Being Absolute,<br />but the Bearing of Illness Being Limited</h2><p>However, we have to make a distinction. God's forgiveness of our sins is basically different from His healing of our diseases. He deals with our sins in a different way than He deals with our sickness. The Lord Jesus bore our sins when He was crucified on the cross. Is there any sin that has not been forgiven? No! God's work is absolute; the work of the cross is so complete that sin has been absolutely taken away (John 1:29). While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He bore our diseases and took away our infirmities. But even though He bore our illnesses, He did not remove them all. He took away our infirmities, but He did not remove all infirmities. Paul even said, "When I am weak, then I am powerful" (2 Cor. 12:10). Of course, Paul did not say, "When I sin, then I am sanctified." Sin is totally and absolutely taken away, but illness is not totally and absolutely removed. The Lord's redemption deals with sickness differently than with sin. Sin is absolutely taken away, while sickness is removed in a limited way.</p><p>Timothy's stomach remained weak. He was a servant of the Lord. Yet the Lord allowed infirmity to remain in his flesh. Salvation and redemption have brought about a complete solution to sin, but sickness is not completely removed. One group of people thinks that the Lord's work deals only with sins, not with sickness. Another group of people think that the Lord deals with sickness to the same extent that He has dealt with sin. Neither of these views represent our stand. The Bible shows us clearly that the Lord's work has dealt with sins as well as sickness. While His dealing with sin is absolute, His dealing with sickness is limited. We must realize that the Lord has dealt with sin in an absolute way. He has resolved all the problems of sin. The Lamb of God has borne everyone's sins. His blood has taken away the sin of the entire world. The problem of sin is fully settled, but sickness still exists among God's children.</p><p>We can consider the matter from another angle. God's children should not have so many illnesses, because the Lord Jesus has borne our illnesses. The Lord Jesus paid much attention to the matter of healing while He was on earth, and although His cross has not taken away all our illnesses, healing is definitely an item included in His work. The fulfillment of Isaiah 53 is Matthew 8, not Matthew 27. This fulfillment was realized before Golgotha. He did not begin to bear our diseases at Golgotha. He bore our diseases on earth before He ever went to Golgotha. The bearing of diseases is not something absolute, like the bearing of sin. This should be quite clear to all of us.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Seeking Healing When Sick</h2><p>There are many reasons a believer becomes sick. I am afraid that many have missed their chance for healing through ignorance of the Lord's work in bearing their illnesses. Let me say a few more words on this matter. Unless you are as confident as Paul, who after praying three times realized that his illness was for his perfection, you should seek healing. Paul prayed, and by the third time, he was clear. The Lord showed him that his weakness was necessary. The Lord's grace was sufficient for him, and Paul's weakness was for a greater manifestation of God's power. Paul accepted his infirmity. If a person is not clear that God wants his infirmity and illness to remain in him, he should by all means seek healing. He should boldly ask the Lord to bear his infirmity and illness. God's children do not live on earth to be sick; they live to glorify God. Illness is good if it glorifies God, but many illnesses may not glorify God. You have to learn to trust in Him. You must realize that the Lord Jesus is a Savior who bears our sickness. The Lord healed many patients when He was on earth. He is the One who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We can ask Him for His healing. We can commit all our illnesses into His hands.</p><h2 class="head1">III. A BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ILLNESS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Discovering the Cause of an Illness</h2><p>A believer should first go before the Lord to discover the cause of his illness. He should not hastily seek healing as soon as he becomes ill. Consider the process a person goes through in an illness. Whenever a person has an illness, the first thing he should do is to discover the cause of the illness. Paul was clear about his own illness. This sets a good pattern for us. God wants us to be clear about the cause of our illnesses. We have to ask whether or not we have disobeyed the Lord. Have we sinned? Have we come short of others? Have we acted against some natural laws? Have we been negligent in certain matters? Often our offense against natural laws is an offense against God, because these laws were created and ordained by God; God rules the universe through these natural laws. There is always a reason for our illnesses.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Anxiously Seeking a Doctor</h2><p>Many people are afraid that they will die as soon as they become sick. They immediately look for a doctor after they become ill and anxiously look forward to their healing. This should not be a believer's attitude. A person first must find out the cause of his illness. Many brothers and sisters have no patience at all. The first thing they do when they are ill is to look for healing. They hastily find a doctor. They are afraid that they will lose their precious lives. On the one hand, they pray as if they trust in God for their healing. On the other hand, they rush to the doctor for medicine and injections. They are afraid, and they treasure their own lives very much. This shows us clearly that they are fully obsessed with themselves. They are too self-centered during ordinary times. When they become sick, they become even more self-centered. It is impossible for a man to be full of the self at ordinary times yet be free from the self when he is sick. Those who are full of self at ordinary times will surely anxiously seek healing when they are sick.</p><h2 class="head2">C. First Dealing with One's Problem before God</h2><p>I can assure you of the futility of such anxiety about your sickness. Being healed is not that simple in the case of a person who belongs to God. Even if you are healed, your sickness may come back. In addition, other kinds of illnesses may come. You must first take care of your problem with God before you can settle the problem of your body. A problem of the body cannot be resolved if a problem before God is not resolved. You must first discover the cause of your sickness before God and then seek healing afterward. You must learn the lesson that comes along with your illness. Even in the case of a sudden severe illness, you must not ignore this lesson. If you deal with God in this way, He will intervene for you and will deliver you out of your woe in a short time.</p><p>Very often we find that we are sick because we have sinned or have committed some mistakes. We must confess to the Lord and ask for forgiveness. Only then can we expect any healing. As we advance a little further in God, we may realize that there is not only sin but also Satan's attack. At times sickness may be a matter of God's discipline. He disciplines us in order that we would become more sanctified, tender, and obedient before Him. There can be many reasons for our sicknesses, and we have to deal with them one by one before the Lord. As we deal with them one by one, we will discover the actual cause of our illness. Sometimes God allows help to come from natural means or from medicine, but at other times, God may not want us to receive help from medicine. He can heal us in an instant.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Learning to Look to God as the Healer</h2><p>We need to realize that healing is always in God's hands. We need to learn to look to the God who heals! In the Old Testament God has a name: "For I am Jehovah who healeth thee" (Exo. 15:26, New Translation). This name of God is a verb; it is a very special name. We need to learn to look to Jehovah, the One who heals. He will always deal graciously with His children.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Calling for the Elders of the Church<br />to Anoint and Pray</h2><p>When a person is sick, the first thing he should do is to discover the cause of his illness. After finding the cause, there are several things to do. One of them is to call for the elders of the church to pray and to anoint him (James 5:14-15). This is the only charge in the Bible for believers who are sick: "Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him."</p><p>When a person is sick, and he has dealt with the Lord about his sickness, one of the things that he can do is to call for the elders of the church to anoint him. This means that he allows the anointing of the Head to flow to him as a member of the Body. He is a part of the Body, and he is asking for the anointing to flow from the Head to him as a member. Some illnesses disappear as soon as life flows through the person. The purpose of the elders' anointing is to convey the anointing of the Head to the members. Some- times a person has moved away from the protection and circulation of the Body through disobedience, sin, or other matters. When he calls for the church elders, he is asking to be received once again into the circulation of the Body. He is asking to be placed once again in the Body of Christ and to receive the flow of life.</p><p>As soon as a member does something wrong in his standing as a member, the life of the Body stops flowing into that part of the Body. The anointing restores that flow. This is the reason behind the calling of the church elders. The elders stand for the church; they are the representation of the Body in a locality. They should anoint for the Body and bring the anointing of the Head once again to the blocked member. Our experience tells us that this kind of anointing can even heal a seriously ill person. We have witnessed God's frequent and speedy intervention in things which are humanly impossible. When this happens, the person is healed.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Other Reasons for Illness</h2><p>Sometimes there is another reason for illness&mdash;individualism. Please remember that individualism is the biggest source of illness. Some people are individualistic; they do things according to their own will. They act by themselves and are always on their own. When God disciplines them, they become ill, and the supply of the Body no longer reaches them. If this is the reason for a person's illness, he needs to ask for the supply of the Body to flow through him once again.</p><p>I dare not say that I have listed all of the reasons for our sicknesses. There are many causes for sickness. Some become sick because they have disobeyed a command of the Lord. Others become sick because they have not fully carried out the Lord's command. Still others become sick because of a certain sin or because of their individualism. Some are individualistic, yet God does not discipline them. However, there are many people, especially those who know the church, who become ill as soon as they become individualistic. Those who do not know the church have less illness. The more we know about the church and the more we are related to the church, the more the Lord will put us in a situation where His hand will be heavy upon us as soon as we become individualistic.</p><p>Sometimes a person becomes sick because he has defiled his body. Whoever defiles his body will find God destroying His temple in that person.</p><p>There are many causes for illness, and I cannot give a list of all of them. I can say only that there is always a reason behind any illness. We must always find the cause of our illnesses. There may be one or more than one reason. Once you discover these reasons, you must confess them one by one to God. Then call for the responsible ones of the church, confess to them, and pray together with them. Ask them to anoint you and to recover you to the life of the Body. You will find your illness immediately gone when life begins to flow through you once again. Although there are natural causes for sickness, you must know that spiritual reasons far outweigh natural reasons. Once you take care of the spiritual reasons, the illnesses will leave promptly.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. ILLNESS AND GOD'S DISCIPLINE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God's Disciplining Hand<br />behind Some Sicknesses</h2><p>It is interesting to note that unbelievers often are easily healed, while Christians are not healed so easily. The New Testament shows that when unbelievers went to the Lord, they were healed immediately. The Bible also speaks of the gift of healing. Both believers and unbelievers can be healed through the gift of healing. However, the Bible also shows that some Christians were never healed. Trophimus was one, Timothy was another, and Paul was a third. These three were the best brothers in the New Testament. Paul kept Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick and nothing could be done (2 Tim. 4:20). Paul advised the sick Timothy to take some wine because his stomach was not clean; Timothy was not healed. Even Paul himself suffered and was weak because of an eye disease or some other malady. This is why he said that there was a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor. 12:7). A thorn always irritates people. Even though a thorn is very small, it is very uncomfortable when lodged in the flesh. Even when it is lodged in the little finger, it can be very painful. Paul's thorn was not a small one but a big one. This thorn caused discomfort to his whole body. In verse 9 he used the term weakness, which tells us how much he suffered! These three persons were the best brothers, yet they were never healed. Instead, they bore their illnesses.</p><p>Illnesses are different from sins. Sins cannot yield the fruit of sanctification, whereas illnesses can yield the fruit of sanctification. It is wrong to lump illnesses together with sins. There are some similarities between the two, but there are also many dissimilarities. The more a man sins, the filthier he becomes. But a man does not become filthier by becoming sick. In fact, he can become holy through his sickness, because God's disciplining hand is with his sickness. Sickness can result in discipline. When God's children are sick, they have to learn to submit to God's mighty hand (1 Pet. 5:6).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Accepting the Lesson<br />That Comes with the Illness</h2><p>If you have an illness, you should learn to deal with your problems one by one before the Lord. After you have dealt with them, you may conclude that God's hand is upon you and that He is doing this to stop you from becoming proud and wild like other sinners. You should remember that you must accept not only the illness but also the lesson that comes with this illness. Having an illness alone is useless; you must learn the lesson that comes with the illness. Illness alone cannot sanctify a person; it is the acceptance of the lesson that comes with the illness that sanctifies a person. You must reap the benefit and result that come with the illness. Perhaps God put His hand on you in order to humble you as He did Paul. He prevented Paul from becoming proud through the revelations that he had received. God may allow a sickness in our flesh to soften us because we are too strong in our disposition. These things can explain why He does not heal us immediately. Sickness alone does not profit anyone; only the softening brings the profit. There is no point in being ill all our lives unless the illness will soften us. Many people have been sick all their life, yet they have never been dealt with by the Lord. Such sickness is in vain. Sometimes a person recovers from an illness after a period of time. But even though the sickness is over, the Lord may not let the person go. Other things will come along the way. As soon as one becomes sick, he has to go to the Lord and seek His speaking.</p><p>Often we can identify the Lord's discipline in our sickness. God disciplines many people through their illness and touches them in certain areas.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Sickness Not Being Something Dreadful</h2><p>Never consider sickness to be something dreadful. The "knife" is not in just anyone's hand. If the one who shaves my hair is my brother, I would not be scared even if he used a big knife. But it would be very frightening indeed if I allowed my enemy to cut my hair. We have to ask in whose hand is the knife. I would be scared if the surgeon who operated on me happened to be my enemy. But I would not be scared if the scalpel was in my brother's hand. Please bear in mind that all sicknesses are in God's hand. Many sick brothers and sisters who are so anxious about their health seem to believe that their sicknesses are in the enemy's hand.</p><p>Please remember that every sickness has been measured by God's hand. Satan is the creator of sickness, and I believe that Satan can make people sick. But everyone who has read the book of Job knows that sickness happens only with God's permission. Every sickness is under God's limitation. Job shows us clearly that Satan cannot make a person sick without God's permission and limitation. God's permission and limitation are the abiding factors. Consider Job's case: God allowed him to be sick, but He did not allow his life to be harmed. Whenever we are sick, we should not feel hopeless and we should not worry. Do not insist on being healed. Do not complain that the sickness has continued too long and that you are afraid of death.</p><p>Please bear in mind that sickness is in the hand of God. It is measured by Him and under His limitation. After Job's trials ran their course, the illness went away; the illness accomplished God's purpose in him. In Job's story we see an end to God's discipline (James 5:11). I would like to say that many people's sicknesses do not have a proper ending; they have not learned the lesson. We must realize that all illnesses are in God's hand; they are all measured by the Lord. Often all we have to do is confess our sins, and the matter is over.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Learning Our Lesson<br />in the Midst of Our Illness</h2><p>God allows many illnesses to remain in us in order for us to learn a lesson. The sooner we learn the lesson, the sooner the illness leaves. Many people love themselves too much. Let me say a frank word to them: The only reason many of them are sick is that they love themselves too much. Many people love themselves to the extent that sickness becomes inevitable. We are of little use to God if He does not purge us of our self-love. We have to learn to not love ourselves.</p><p>Some people think only of themselves all day long. They think the whole world revolves around them and that they are the center of the universe. They think that everyone should live for them. Their thoughts are occupied with nothing but themselves day and night; in their view everything revolves around them. God in heaven is for them, and God on earth is for them as well. Christ is for them, and the church is for them. In fact, the whole world is for them. God has no alternative but to tear down this center. Many people are not easily healed because they expect sympathy from others. I know that some sisters have experienced this. When they reject the sympathy of others, their sicknesses leave.</p><p>Perhaps many are ill because they like to be ill. They are loved only when they are ill, so they like to be ill. No one loves them when they are not ill, so they always try to be sick in order to be loved. In fact, they want to be sick forever so that they can be loved forever. I have seen such cases. Sometimes it takes someone to rebuke them strongly, saying, "You are sick because you love yourself too much. You want others to love you and to pay attention to you in your illness. You want others to visit you and to sympathize with you. This is why you are always sick." As soon as they accept God's dealing and acknowledge the cause of their illness, they are healed immediately.</p><p>I can report hundreds of cases that I have witnessed during the past twenty or more years of my life. They all prove that many people are sick for specific reasons. Their illnesses are healed immediately when they identify the causes, deal with them, and remove them. As long as the causes remain, they cannot be healed.</p><p>I know of a brother who always desired affection from others. He wanted to be loved, to be spoken to nicely, to receive visits, and to be treated in a gentle way. If anyone asked how he was doing, he immediately would relate everything that had happened the previous night or that morning in a detailed way. He could tell others almost the exact time of his fever, from what hour to what hour, and the kind of headache he experienced, from what hour to what hour. He could tell you exactly how many times he breathed and how many times his heart beat a minute. He was always feeling ill, and he always liked to tell others about his illness. He wanted the warm sympathy of others. If you talked to him, he would have nothing to talk about except his illness. Every day he talked about his illness, and he wondered why he was never healed.</p><p>It is not an easy thing to speak an honest word to others. One must pay a price to speak the truth. One day I gathered enough strength within myself to speak to this one. I said, "The only reason you have been sick so long is that you like to be sick." He denied it. I said, "Do you not love your illness? You are afraid that this illness will leave you. You love your illness." He denied it again. But I said, "You like others to sympathize with you and to love you. You like others to take care of you and to treat you nicely. You cannot have it by other means, so you try to get it by becoming ill. If you want to be healed by the Lord, you must rid yourself of this thought! When others ask how you are doing, you need to learn to say, `I am fine.' See what will happen if you do that! When others ask how you were doing the night before, you should say, `Fine!'" He said, "My heart is sincere. I cannot lie. I feel that I am not fine. What should I do if I truly was not well the night before?" I said, "Let me read you a verse. The son of the Shunammite woman was lying on the bed already dead. She went to see Elisha, and he asked, `Is it well with you?...Is it well with the child? And she said, It is well' (2 Kings 4:26). Actually, her son was lying on the bed already dead. Why did she say that it was well? She said it because she believed. She believed that God would save her son. Today you can believe, too. When others ask, `How were you last night?' You should say, `Fine.' It is fine even if you died the night before. You have to believe that it was fine." He had nothing to say after these words. As soon as he denied his self-love, rejected sympathy, and dropped his expectation for consolation, his illness went away.</p><p>We must realize that many illnesses have internal causes as well as external causes. A man must learn to believe in God. When God's purpose is achieved, the sickness goes away. Once God achieves His spiritual goal in us, our sickness is over.</p><h2 class="head2">E. With the Exception of a Few Cases,<br />One Needing to Discover the Causes<br />and to Seek Healing</h2><p>I believe that when Paul wrote 2 Timothy, Timothy and Trophimus, as well as Paul himself, still had their illnesses. However, they acknowledged that their illnesses were there to help them in their work; they learned to look after themselves and to be restricted for the sake of God's glory upon them. Paul advised Timothy to take a little wine and to take care of his eating. At the same time, both were serving the Lord. Of course, the Lord supplied them with enough grace to overcome their weaknesses. Although Paul was sick, he still worked. When we read Paul's Epistles, we have to agree that the amount of his work equaled that of ten men. But God could use such a weak vessel. He was able to get more from him than He could get from ten strong men. Although his body was weak, God gave him the strength and the life to do what he should do.</p><p>In the Bible, there were not too many men like Paul, Timothy, and Trophimus who were continually sick. God only arranges such unusual circumstances for those whom He will use and perfect. As for the rest, especially the new believers, they should examine themselves and should ask whether they have sinned in any way when they become ill. When one confesses his sins and deals with them, it is easy for him to be healed.</p><p>Finally, I would like to point out that sickness can be the result of Satan's sudden attacks, and sometimes it can be the result of offending the laws of nature. There may not be a spiritual cause for our sickness, but we can bring everything to the Lord. If it is an attack from the enemy, we can rebuke it in the name of the Lord, and it will leave. There was a sister who had a fever that would not go away. There was no special reason for her fever. Later she found out that it was Satan's attack, and she rebuked it in the Lord's name. The illness immediately went away.</p><p>Sometimes sickness can be the result of acting contrary to the laws of nature. If a person puts his finger in the fire, he will be burned. We should take good care of ourselves whenever possible. We should not wait until we are sick to confess our sins. Once we confess our sins, we will surely be forgiven. But we should not wait until we have sinned and something is wrong with our bodies before we look to God for healing. We should not neglect the ordinary duties and care.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE WAY TO BE HEALED&mdash;<br />THREE PHRASES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>What happens when a man prays for healing? We need to have a brief discussion about this.</p><p>There are three expressions in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Mark, that I have spent much time studying and learning. These three expressions have been particularly helpful, at least to me. The first is a matter of the Lord's power, the second is a matter of His will, and the third is a matter of His act.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Lord's Power&mdash;God Can</h2><p>Once I read the Gospel of Mark while I was sick and found a few words that were especially helpful to me. The first portion is in Mark 9:21-23: "And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood. And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us. And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes." Do you understand what this means? The father told the Lord Jesus, "If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us." The Lord Jesus replied, "If You can"! Why did He say, "If You can"? These three words of the Lord Jesus are a quotation of the father's remark. The Lord Jesus repeated what the father had said. The father said, "If You can do anything...help us." The Lord Jesus exclaimed, "If You can. All things are possible to him who believes." It is not a matter of whether the Lord can, but a matter of whether the father could believe. All things are possible to him who believes.</p><p>When a man is sick, he is often full of doubts. He cannot believe in the power of God. It seems to him that the power of germs is stronger than the power of God. In effect, he is saying that the power of a little bacteria which can be seen only under a microscope is stronger than the power of God. When a trial of sickness comes, one finds the threat of the germs magnified to a great degree. But the Lord rebukes those who doubt His power in the midst of their sickness. The Bible seldom records the Lord Jesus interrupting a man's speaking. But here He said, "If You can"! It seems as if the Lord was angry, as if He had lost His temper! (The Lord forgives me for saying this.) When the father said, "If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us," it seemed as if the Lord Jesus was saying, "How can you say, `If You can'? What do you mean, `If You can'? All things are possible to him who believes! It is not a matter of if I can, but a matter of whether or not you believe. Why do you ask whether or not I can?" The first thing a child of God should learn when he is sick is to lift up his eyes and say, "Lord, You can!"</p><p>Recall the incident when the Lord healed the paralytic. (I like the Lord's words very much because each time He speaks He chooses His words very carefully.) He told the Pharisees, "Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?" (Mark 2:9). The Pharisees must have thought that it was easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven." Saying such words is, of course, very easy, because they can be said, but no one will actually know whether the sins were forgiven. But it is not easy to say, "Rise up and walk." The Lord's word proves that He can forgive as well as heal. Look at the Lord Jesus' question carefully. Consider whether this is better: "Which is harder: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?" However, the Lord did not say this. He used a different word. He said, "Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?"</p><p>The Lord Jesus was asking which was easier because both are easy from His point of view. Forgiving sins is easy, and asking the paralytic to rise up and walk is easy as well. This is why He said, "Which is easier?" Actually, the Pharisees were asking which was harder. From their point of view, forgiving sins and asking a paralytic to pick up the mat and walk were both difficult. Both were difficult, and they were just trying to find out which one was more difficult. However, the Lord Jesus said, "Which is easier?"</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Lord's Will&mdash;God Will</h2><p>It is true that God can heal us, but how do we know that He will heal us? We do not know His will. Suppose the Lord is not willing to heal us. What should we do? This is the second consideration. Mark 1:41 says, "Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, `I will; be clean'" (RSV). Here is the second question. It is not enough for a sick person merely to know the power of God. He needs to know that God is willing. No matter how great His power is, it is useless to us if He is not willing to heal us. Here the question is not whether God is able, but whether He is willing. No matter how great His power is, it has nothing to do with us if He has no intention of healing us. The first thing to be settled is whether or not God can. The second thing to be settled is whether or not God will. Here we see the Lord Jesus telling the leper, "I will." There is no sickness more unclean than leprosy. All of the sicknesses in the Old Testament are merely illnesses, but leprosy is a kind of defilement. Whoever touches a leper will be infected with leprosy (at least this was what men thought). However, the Lord was full of love. He said, "I will." He stretched out His hand and touched the leper. The leper was cleansed! The Lord Jesus was willing to cleanse the leper. Can it be possible that He is not willing to heal us? We can say that God can and God will. It is not enough to know that God can. We must also know that God will.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lord's Act&mdash;God Has Done</h2><p>God is willing to heal, but this is not enough. He still needs to do one thing. We need to look at Mark 11:23-24: "Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says happens, he will have it. For this reason I say to you, All things [including sickness] that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." This passage speaks of what God has accomplished. Here we see three things: God can, God will, and God has done.</p><p>What is faith? Faith is not just believing that God can and will but believing that God has done something. It is believing that He has accomplished something. Believe that you have received them, and you will have them. If you have faith, you will have the assurance that God can and God will. If He gives you a word, you will thank Him, saying, "God has healed me. He has done it!" Many people are confused about this. As a result, their sickness is not healed. They are always hoping to be healed. Hope involves the expectation that something will happen in the future, whereas faith knows that something has happened already. I can believe that God will heal me, but this healing may take place twenty years later, or a hundred years later. But those with a genuine faith will rise up and say, "Thank God, He has healed me! Thank God, I have received! Thank God, I am cleansed! Thank God, I am well!" When faith is perfected, it does not say merely that God can or will, but that He has done.</p><p>God has accomplished it! He has heard your prayer. His word has healed you. He has already accomplished it! Believe that you have received it, and you will have it. The faith of many people is a faith that believes in what they will receive. As a result, they never receive anything. You should have the faith that you have already received. Faith proclaims, "It is done," not, "It will be done."</p><p>Consider one simple illustration. Suppose we preach the gospel today, and a person hears the gospel, believes, and repents. He says that he has believed. If you ask him, "Have you believed in the Lord Jesus?", he may say, "I have believed." If you also ask him, "Are you saved?", he may say, "I will be saved." You know from this answer that something is wrong. Suppose you ask him again whether or not he is saved. He may say, "I will surely be saved." You know that something is still wrong with this, and you ask him again, "Are you sure that you will be saved?" He may say, "I will surely be saved." Something is not right. He may say that he will be saved, definitely will be saved, or surely will be saved, but something does not sound right. If you ask him, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus and are you saved?", and he answers, "I am saved!", then he has struck the right chord. A person is saved as soon as he has believed. Faith always relates to the past tense. Faith in being healed is like one's faith in his salvation. He does not believe that he will be healed, shall be healed, or must be healed. These are not faith. When a man has faith, he will say, "Thank God I am healed."</p><p>We must lay hold of these three things: God can, God will, and God has done. Our sickness will leave once our faith reaches the stage of "God has done."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS</h1><p>There are at least four different kinds of forgiveness in the Bible. We will give a different name to each of them: First, there is eternal forgiveness. Second, there is instrumental forgiveness. Third, there is forgiveness in fellowship. Fourth, there is governmental forgiveness. If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God's governmental forgiveness. We will first distinguish the differences between these kinds of forgiveness, and then we will speak about governmental forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ETERNAL FORGIVENESS</h2><p>Let us call the forgiveness that comes with our salvation God's eternal forgiveness. This is the forgiveness spoken of by the Lord Jesus in Luke 24:47: "That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem." This is eternal forgiveness. The forgiveness spoken of in Romans 4:7 is eternal forgiveness as well.</p><p>This forgiveness is called eternal forgiveness because once God forgives our sins, He forgives them eternally. God casts our sins into the depths of the sea and the abyss. He no longer sees or remembers our sins. This is the forgiveness we obtained at the time we were saved. The moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven of all our sins; the Lord removes all of our sins, and we are left with no trace of sin before God. This is called eternal forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head1">II. INSTRUMENTAL FORGIVENESS</h2><p>God often tells man directly, "I forgive you." But often He declares His forgiveness through the church: "God has forgiven your sins." Therefore, the Bible shows us another kind of forgiveness which we call instrumental forgiveness. John 20:22-23 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." In sending the Holy Spirit to His church, the Lord charged the church to be His representative on earth. The church has become His vessel. Forgiveness is now granted through the church. This is called instrumental forgiveness. However, we must be careful not to fall into the kind of forgiveness taught by the Catholics. We must realize that the basis of instrumental forgiveness is the Lord's breathing into the church and saying to the church, "Receive the Holy Spirit." After the church receives the Holy Spirit, it has the power to retain and forgive sins. The church can declare that the sins of certain ones are retained, while the sins of others are forgiven. The church has such authority because it is under the authority of the Holy Spirit. The Lord breathed into the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit!" After this He said, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." This is a kind of indirect forgiveness. In this forgiveness God forgives men through the church; the church acts as His channel.</p><p>In preaching the gospel, we often find sinners who are awakened to their sin by our word. We bring them to the Lord, and they confess that they are sinners. They pray for forgiveness with weeping and tears of repentance, and they receive the Lord Jesus with a sincere heart. But they do not know the meaning of forgiveness because they are heathens. At such times, it is good for a representative of the church to stand up and say to them, "God has forgiven you of your sins!" This will save them much suffering and anxious searching. If a person has truly believed, you may say to him, "You have accepted the Lord today. You can thank Him because He has forgiven you of your sins!" If the church cannot forgive or retain men's sins, it has no way to decide who may be baptized. Why do you accept one candidate for baptism while refusing another? Why do you receive some for the bread-breaking meeting while refusing others? This is an exercise of the authority that the church has received from the Lord. It proclaims who is saved and who is not, and whose sins are forgiven and whose are retained. Such declarations must not be made in a light way. Those whose sins are forgiven are forgiven, while those whose sins are retained have their sins retained. Such a statement must be made under the authority of the Holy Spirit. John 20:22 says, "Receive the Holy Spirit." Verse 23 continues, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." Only when the church has received the Holy Spirit and is under the authority of the Holy Spirit can it act as an instrument to God. Only after the Lord has made a man an instrument can he proclaim to a sinner, "You are forgiven of your sins!" or to another sinner, "Your sins are not forgiven!" This is the second kind of forgiveness described in the Bible. In this forgiveness, God does not forgive directly; He does it through the church. Eternal forgiveness is God's direct forgiveness of men. Instrumental forgiveness is God's proclamation of forgiveness through man.</p><h2 class="head1">III. FORGIVENESS IN FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>There is a third kind of forgiveness in the Bible. We call this forgiveness in fellowship. First John 1:7-9 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." First John 2:1-2 continues, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world." The forgiveness spoken of in this portion of the Word is neither the forgiveness at the time of our salvation nor the forgiveness pronounced by the church. This forgiveness is different from the above two kinds of forgiveness. After one believes in the Lord and has become a child of God, often he still needs God's forgiveness. This is the forgiveness spoken of in an earlier chapter [Volume 49, Chapter 21], in which the ashes of the red heifer are applied. After we believe in the Lord, confess our Christian faith, and receive eternal forgiveness, we may still sin at times. We may become weak and encounter setbacks before the Lord. This kind of sin produces a barrier in our fellowship with God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Characteristic of Life&mdash;<br />Delighting in Fellowship</h2><p>All biologists know that life has two basic characteristics: First, it strives to live, to preserve itself, to continue its existence. Life abhors death. Second, it does not want to be cut off from fellowship. Life abhors isolation. If a chicken is left by itself, it will be sullen. If you put it with many other chickens, it will become lively. If you keep a prisoner in isolation, he will suffer because he cannot have fellowship with other men. Man is a living creature. Like other living creatures, he strives to preserve his own life, and he also delights in fellowship.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Frustrations to the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>We believe that the blood of the Lord Jesus has saved us. There is absolutely no question as far as our life is concerned; we are saved and are eternally forgiven. This part does not pose any problem to us.</p><p>But another matter may pose a problem. After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him. What does it mean for our fellowship to be interrupted? Suppose a little girl goes to the kitchen secretly and steals the food her mother has prepared, or some fruit from the cabinet, or other things. Suppose she eats all the food while her mother is away. She may close the door of the kitchen properly, clean her face, and wipe the table, but a transgression has been committed! Before this she was very intimate with her mother every night. But on this night, she may not be as intimate as before because she has stolen something. When her mother calls her from upstairs, her heart may start bounding downstairs. She may think that her mother is going to spank her. Her mother may even offer her some food, but she will not have any taste for it. She will be in constant fear that her mother knows what she has done. She may try to hide herself from her mother. In this we see that the child's fellowship with her mother has been interrupted. After she steals the food, she does not cease to be her mother's daughter; she is still a daughter, but her fellowship with her mother has been interrupted. After you have sinned, you do not cease to be a child of God. You are still God's child, but your fellowship with Him has been interrupted. Sin cuts off fellow- ship immediately. You no longer have a conscience that is void of offense. You must have a pure conscience before you can enjoy a continuous fellowship with God. If your conscience is offended, you have no way to fellowship with God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. How to Restore Our Fellowship with God</h2><p>A child of God does not lose his status as a child after he has sinned. However, he may lose his fellowship with God through his sin. There is a forgiveness, however, which we call forgiveness in fellowship. We call it forgiveness in fellow- ship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored. Otherwise, he has no way to fellowship with God. He may not even be able to pray to God or say amen when others pray. He will suffer very much within himself.</p><p>What should one do? Take the earlier example of the little girl who stole from her mother. She must go to her mother and say, "I have stolen the biscuits you have prepared. I have eaten the fruit you placed on the table. I should not have done this." She has to stand on the ground of her mother and acknowledge her sin as sin. She must give sin the proper name. She must say, "Please forgive my sins!" In the same way, we must come to God and say, "I have sinned. I have sinned against You in this matter. Please forgive me!" If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Such a forgiveness has nothing to do with eternal forgiveness. It has to do with our fellowship with God. This is why we call it forgiveness in fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS</h2><p>There is another kind of forgiveness in the Bible which we call governmental forgiveness. We can understand this kind of forgiveness from the following verses: Matthew 6:14-15; 9:2, 5-6; 18:21-35; James 5:15. We call the forgiveness that is spoken of in all these verses governmental forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head2">A. What God's Governmental Forgiveness Is</h2><p>Some may ask, "What is God's governmental forgiveness?" I have often thought that if a person were made aware of God's government immediately upon becoming a Christian, he would spare himself many troubles and problems.</p><p>Let me once again use the illustration of the little girl. Before such an incident as described above occurred, her mother would have left the doors of the rooms in the house open whenever she left the house. She would have left the door to the kitchen open and the kitchen cabinet doors unlocked. Even though there may have been considerable food in the cabinets, she would have left the door open. On that particular day, when she comes back to the house, she may discover that her daughter has stolen food from the cabinets. Since the mother has found out, the daughter has no choice but to confess her sins and ask for forgiveness. The mother forgives her and kisses her. She says, "I forgive you," and the matter is over with and the fellowship restored. But from that time on, she begins to lock the doors whenever she leaves the house. She has changed her way! Fellowship is one thing, while government is another thing.</p><p>What is government? Government is the way of doing things. In our words, God's government is His way of doing things; it is His administration. The mother forgives her child's sin. She says, "Since you have eaten the food already, I will not pursue the matter any further." She forgives her daughter, and the fellowship is restored. When the daughter sees her mother, she can be as happy and intimate as before. But the next time the mother leaves the house, the cabinets and the door to the kitchen will be locked. In other words, the way of handling things will be different. Fellowship can be restored, but the way of doing things cannot be easily restored. The mother is afraid that her child will do the same thing again. She will no longer grant her daughter the kind of freedom she had before. She will put on some kind of restrictions. The way is changed. Please bear in mind that God treats us according to the same principle. Forgiveness in fellowship is easy. Fellowship is easily restored for those who confess with a true heart. Once they confess that they have sinned against God, God will recover the fellowship between Him and them. But God's way of dealing with these ones may immediately become different. God's discipline may be exercised upon them. He may no longer allow them to be as free or loose.</p><p>One day the disciplining hand of God may be lifted. At that time we will have governmental forgiveness. After a period of time, the mother may feel that her child can once again be trusted. She then leaves the kitchen door open once more. This is called governmental forgiveness.</p><p>Forgiveness of fellowship is one thing, while governmental forgiveness is another. A father may tell his sons to go outside to play at four o'clock and to come back for dinner at six o'clock. Suppose one day the children go out and fight with other children. When they come home, they confess their sin to their father. The father forgives them and lets them out again the next day, but they get into a fight with other children again. What should the father do? They may confess their sins day after day and the father may forgive them day after day, but the father will wonder whether his way of government is wrong. He may wonder if it is wrong to let them out every day. He may say, "Starting from tomorrow, you will stay at home and not go out because you have been fighting outside." The father's hand has come in. When we sin against God, God will forgive us when we confess our sins to Him. However, we cannot stop Him from using other methods to discipline us. God will forgive us, and our fellowship with Him can be restored, but He may change His way with us. A man must realize that God's governmental hand is not easily removed. It is not easy for God to take away His governmental hand. God will remove His governmental hand only when He has full assurance that His children are doing the right things. When the father sees his children continuing to make trouble, he will tell them to stay at home and withhold their freedom. He will shut them up for days, weeks, or even months, until he is satisfied that they will no longer cause trouble, quarreling or fighting with people. At that time the father may say to his children, "You have behaved well during the past two months. You may go out for ten minutes tomorrow." The governmental hand is lifted. Have you seen this? We call these ten minutes a governmental forgiveness. The governmental way has changed. The father still has to observe how the children behave among others during those ten minutes. If the children do not engage in a fight, the father may allow them to go out again for half an hour the next day. After some time, he may extend the time to an hour. Perhaps after one or two months, they may play from four o'clock to six o'clock again. When that day comes, we can say that governmental forgiveness has been fully exercised in the children! Brothers, what does governmental forgiveness mean? Governmental forgiveness is absolutely different from eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, and forgiveness in fellowship. Governmental forgiveness is related to the way God manages, rules over, and deals with us.</p><h2 class="head2">B. What a Man Sows, That He Reaps</h2><p>Many portions in the Bible point out similar things. For example, Galatians 6:7 says, "Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap." This speaks of God's governmental hand. If a father spoils his children, his children will not grow up in a proper way. A father who does not care for his own family will end up with a tragedy. This is the only possible result. A person who always argues and fights with others and who holds different opinions will have no friends. What a man sows, that he reaps. This is God's government, God's ordained law. No one can change such a law. God's children must be careful not to provoke His governmental hand. It is not easy for God to remove His hand once it is provoked.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lord's Healing of a Paralytic Being<br />a Governmental Forgiveness</h2><p>A certain paralytic was carried to the Lord in the presence of the scribes. The Lord Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven" (Matt. 9:2). If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying. The paralytic did not express his belief; it was others who bore him on a bed to the Lord. Yet the Lord said to him, "Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven." Does this mean that the paralytic was saved when he was carried to the Lord? If he were, salvation would have been too easy. One would only have to be carried to the Lord, and his sins would be forgiven. No, this certainly does not refer to eternal forgiveness. It has nothing to do with instrumental forgiveness or even forgiveness in fellowship. This is another kind of forgiveness. The Lord shows us two things here. On the one hand, the paralytic's sins were forgiven. On the other hand, he had to rise and pick up his mat and walk. Please bear in mind that many sicknesses are the result of God's governmental hand. In order for the paralytic to be healed and to rise again, he first needed to receive governmental forgiveness. Such forgiveness is related to God's government. It is related to sicknesses, not to eternal life. When others carried the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, His forgiveness clearly related to the sickness of paralysis. This man came to the Lord to be healed, and the Lord Jesus said that his sins were forgiven. In other words, his sickness would be healed once his sins were forgiven. His sickness was related to his sins. The Lord Jesus said such a word because the sickness was the result of the man's sins before God. He was sick because he had not settled the issue of his sins yet. When this issue was settled, his sickness was gone. This is governmental forgiveness. Sickness goes away when governmental forgiveness comes. Such a sin clearly involved a governmental offense. The man was sick because he had done something which had offended God's government. Once the Lord forgave him of his sins, he could rise, pick up his mat, and go home. This forgiveness is different from the other kinds of forgiveness. It is the forgiveness which enables one to pick up his mat and go home. This is governmental forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Elders of the Church<br />Anointing the Sick and Praying for Them<br />to Receive Governmental Forgiveness</h2><p>James 5:14-15 says, "Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him." This seems to be a very special kind of forgiveness. Here was a brother who was sick. The elders of the church were invited to anoint him with oil and pray for him, and the prayer of faith would cause the sick to rise up. If he had committed any sin, it would be forgiven him. We have seen that sickness may be caused by many factors. Some sicknesses may not be the result of sin, but some are. The sin here is not forgiven through the confession of the sick one; it is forgiven through the prayer of the elders of the church. Why are his sins forgiven after the elders of the church pray for him and apply the anointing to him? What sins are spoken of in this verse? One cannot apply such a method to eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, or forgiveness in fellowship. I believe that this is related to God's government. Suppose a brother is sick because of God's governmental hand. He has sinned and has fallen, and God is disciplining him. Although he has confessed his sins and has been forgiven and restored to fellowship, God's disciplining hand has not been lifted. He has to wait for the elders of the church to come to him and make petition on his behalf, saying, "The brothers have forgiven his sins. We expect to see him rise up again. The church would like to see such a brother being recovered to the flow of life. Therefore, we anoint his body with oil that the ointment of the Head may flow to him once more." When the church does this to the sick one, he will be restored. In many cases, a person may have sinned and offended God's government. As soon as God removes His governmental hand from such a person, his sickness will be healed. When God removes His governmental hand, we have the fulfillment of the word, "If he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him." This sin is different from other ordinary sins. In our reading of the Bible, we must realize that James 5 is a chapter on governmental forgiveness. If we fall under God's governmental hand, He will not let us go until we are fully forgiven.</p><h2 class="head2">E. David under God's Governmental Hand</h2><p>To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament. No portion of the Bible speaks of God's governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah's wife. David committed two sins: adultery and murder. His adultery was a sin against Uriah's wife, and his murder was a sin against Uriah himself. If you read Psalm 51 and a few other psalms, you will see how David confessed his sins after his mistakes. He felt the shame, the defilement, and the offense that he had committed against God. He was sincere in his confession to God. This shows us clearly that his fellowship with God was restored after his confession in Psalm 51. This restoration of fellowship is analogous to that which is spoken of in 1 John 1.</p><p>What did God say to David? He sent Nathan to speak to David. I want you to pay special attention to what Nathan said in 2 Samuel 12:13 after David said, "I have sinned against Jehovah." Nathan said to David, "Jehovah has also put away your sin; you will not die." David said, "I have sinned against Jehovah." He confessed his sins and admitted his guilt. He confessed that he was defiled and had sinned against Jehovah. In return God said through Nathan, "Jehovah has also put away your sin; you will not die." Clearly David's sins were forgiven; God had put away his sins. What did God say to David after that? He said, "Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die" (v. 14). He also said, "Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife" (v. 10). Finally, He said, "I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and even before the sun" (vv. 11-12). God had already put away David's sins, but He would cause the son born to Uriah's wife to die and the sword not to depart from his house. God had already put away David's sins, but He would allow Absalom to rebel and defile David's wives. In other words, sins may be forgiven but the discipline does not go away immediately.</p><p>Let me say a frank word to you. You may go to God and ask for forgiveness for any sin, and God will forgive you. The restoring of fellowship can be quick. David restored his fellowship with God very quickly, but God's discipline continued even after his death. God's government would not depart from him as long as His discipline was upon him. Not long after this episode, his son became sick. Even though David fasted and laid on the floor the whole night, it was useless. God's disciplinary hand fell upon David and his son died. Following this, his eldest son Amnon was murdered, and then Absalom rebelled. The sword never departed from David's house! Yet God said to David, "I have forgiven your sins!" Brothers, God may have forgiven your sins, but even though He has forgiven you, you cannot stop His chastisement on you and His governmental hand upon you.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Learning to Humble Oneself<br />under God's Mighty Hand</h2><p>Our God is a God of government. He will not move His governmental hand immediately away from those who have sinned against Him. Often, God does not do anything; He lets you go. But as soon as He stretches forth His governmental hand, you can do nothing except humble yourself under His mighty hand. You have no escape! God is not like man; He is not sloppy and will not let you go! A sin which damages one's fellowship with God can easily be forgiven, and a person can easily be recovered. But no one can run away from God's discipline in the environment, the home, one's career, and his physical body. The only thing we can do is to learn to humble ourselves under His mighty hand. The more we humble ourselves under His mighty hand and give up all resistance, the easier it is for God to lift His governmental hand. The more we refuse to humble ourselves, and the more angry, vocal, or indignant we become, the more difficult it is for God to lift His governmental hand. This is a very serious matter! Twenty years ago we might have done something according to our own will. Today we still have to face the same thing. We still have to suffer the consequences. It will come back to haunt us. When such a thing catches up with us, we should bow our head and say, "Lord, it is all my fault!" We must humble ourselves under God's hand. Do not resist. The more we resist, the heavier God's hand will become. Let me repeat: Let us humble ourselves under God's mighty hand. The more we reject God's governmental hand, the more problems we will encounter. When God's governmental hand is upon us, we must humble ourselves and say, "Lord, You have done no wrong! I deserve this." We must humble ourselves. We must not only remove all rebellious thoughts but also take away all reasonings and murmurings.</p><p>It is not easy to be rebellious and to try to escape God's hand. Who can escape His hand? You must realize that you have fallen into your present state through what you did before. Suppose a brother loved sugar too much as a youth, and his teeth have decayed from the overconsumption of sweets. One day he feels that he has eaten too many sweets. These sweets have brought about his toothaches. He asks God to forgive his sin of indulgence in eating. God can easily forgive such a sin. But it does not mean that his teeth will recover from their decay. His teeth will still be bad; that is God's government. If you eat sweets, your teeth will decay. If you confess your weakness, the fellowship will be restored, but it does not mean that good teeth will grow back after your confession. Once you recognize God's government, you have to learn to humble yourself under it. One can never recover a tooth from decay, but there are matters concerning God's governmental hand which can be removed, and the person involved can be recovered.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Falling under God's Governmental Hand<br />Being a Serious Matter</h2><p>Let us consider one portion of the Word. After Moses smote the rock in Meribah (Num. 20:10-12), both he and Aaron fell under God's governmental hand. After Aaron failed, God still allowed him to remain a priest and restored his fellowship with God. Even though he wore the priestly robe, God nevertheless told him that he would not be able to live. Moses also did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One when he was by the rock. God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure. He did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One. God's hand was upon his servants, and Aaron and Moses could not enter Canaan. Do you see the basic principle here? This is God's government! We cannot pin down our God. We cannot guarantee that God will always treat us the same way as before. At a certain point, God may change His way with us. He may change even what we consider to be the best way.</p><p>The Bible is full of such stories. For example, when the Israelites reached Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran, spies went up to spy out the land (Num. 13&mdash;14). When they saw that it would take two people to carry a cluster of grapes, they realized that the land was a land flowing with milk and honey. But they became afraid and refused to enter into that land, because they saw that the people who dwelt in that land were of great stature. In their own sight the Israelites were as grasshoppers. As a result, all but two of them died in the wilderness. Joshua and Caleb were the only two persons who would go into the good land. Later, the people confessed their sins and wanted to go in. God still treated them as His people and was gracious to them. However, they could no longer have a part in the land of Canaan. God's government had changed! Brothers, the very day that you begin your Christian life, you should set a hope before you that you will stay on the course that God has measured to you, all the way to the end. Do not live loosely. Do not sin. Please bear in mind that even though God may be merciful, He can change His way! God's governmental hand will never let you go.</p><p>God's governmental hand is indeed a serious matter! I know of a brother who was clearly called by the Lord to set aside his career to serve the Lord. He went home for a visit but could not bring himself to quit his occupation. He wanted to be a good Christian, but he did not want to set aside his career or spend his life for the gospel. Since then he is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. But it is impossible for him to turn back to this way! Please bear in mind that our greatest fear is God's disciplining hand; we do not know when His hand will come upon us! God may let us go, even if we rebel ten times, but He may not let us go the eleventh time. However, God will not let some people go the first time they rebel. We do not know when God will catch up with us! Brothers, please bear in mind that God's government is not something under our control! He does things according to His will.</p><p>I know of a sister who at one time wanted to consecrate herself to serve the Lord. Later she married, and her marriage was not a very good one. As soon as she made such a move, the light ceased to shine in her. There is no way to ask her to return to this way now. God's governmental hand is upon her. Today we cannot turn her back no matter how hard we try. Light is shut off from her; it is invisible. It is as if a veil is hanging in front of her. There is no way for her to see the light again.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Trying Our Best to Be Obedient to the Lord<br />and to Ask for His Mercy</h2><p>Therefore, brothers, the first thing we should do is to try our best to obey the Lord. May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us, and may He keep us from falling into His governmental hand. However, if we should fall into His governmental hand, we should not try to get out hastily. Do not resist and do not flee. Do not give up on one basic principle&mdash;to obey God at any cost. I am not asking you to obey by yourself, because you cannot obey by yourself. We must ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to enable us to obey. Only when the Lord has mercy on us will we be able to get through in this matter. "Lord, have mercy on me, or I will not be able to get through in this." We must always ask the Lord to grant us mercy to get through and to not fall into His governmental hand. If God's governmental hand is already upon us and we are already sick or in the midst of some dire experiences or difficulties, we must remember to not resist God's government with our fleshly hand. As soon as His governmental hand is upon us, we should learn to humble ourselves under His mighty hand. We must say, "Lord, this is Your work! This is Your arrangement! I gladly yield myself to it. I am willing, and I accept it!" When God's governmental hand was upon Job (whom God could easily have spared), the more that Job accepted it, the better it was for him. The more he talked about his own righteousness, the worse his condition became.</p><p>Thank God! God's governmental hand often does not remain upon a person all the time. Personally, I believe that when God's governmental hand is upon a person, it can easily be removed by the prayer of the church. This is the precious lesson we find in James 5, which tells us that the elders of the church can lift God's governmental hand. James said that the prayer of faith can cause a person to rise up. If he has committed any sin, his sin can be forgiven. If a brother is enlightened concerning this matter, and the church prays for him, very often God will lift His governmental and disciplining hand.</p><p>Once when I was talking to Miss M. E. Barber, she related an interesting story to me. A brother had done something terrible. Later, he repented and came to Miss Barber. She said to the man, "You have repented and have turned back, have you not? Now you must go to the Lord and tell Him, `I was once a vessel in the hand of the potter. Now the vessel is broken.' Do not force the Lord to do anything by saying, `Lord, You must make me another kind of vessel.' You must humble yourself and pray, `Lord, be merciful to me. Let me be a vessel again! I can no longer insist on being a vessel by myself.' The Lord can make you a vessel unto honor, or He can make you a vessel unto dishonor." Many people still want to be the same kind of vessel. They insist that the Lord make them glorious all the time, but sometimes blessing can come out of a curse. However, I can tell you this: We have all passed through many dealings. I have fallen into God's hand many times; God's governmental hand has been upon me. We must admit that we often get to know God's will even more through His governmental hand. There is no way to dodge it; we can only humble ourselves. We can do nothing except humble ourselves. As time goes by, we will see that it is impossible to avoid or dodge any issue. We have to humble ourselves under God's will. We can only say, "Lord! What You have arranged for me is always the best. I can only humble my heart before You!"</p><p>We must not be careless or loose about these matters. I know of a sister who came to see me about marrying a certain man. I told her that as far as I knew, she should not marry him because he did not seem to be a trustworthy Christian. She said that she was confident that the marriage would work. Seven or eight months after her marriage, she wrote a very long letter to me and said, "I know now I was wrong. I did not listen to your word. I know now that it was a great mistake! What should I do?" I replied, "From now on, you have only one way&mdash;humble yourself under God's mighty hand. Even though you tell me about your problem, I cannot help you. No one can help you. You have already fallen into God's governmental hand. If you struggle and rebel, your vessel will only break, and you will only sacrifice your own future." I warned her in a strong way in the letter that she should not even try to write another letter to me. We must remember that God's government is most serious!</p><p>A thought often comes to me: What can I compare the present condition of the church to? The church is like a potter's house with many broken vessels, broken tubs, and broken vases strewn everywhere. One finds broken vessels everywhere. This is the situation among Christians today. This is a very serious matter. I say again, we must learn to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand.</p><h2 class="head1">V. FEARING GOD AND BEING GENEROUS TO OTHERS</h2><p>Two other portions of the Word speak about God's governmental hand: Matthew 6:15 and 18:23-35. One very important thing can be found in these verses&mdash;do not condemn others easily. This is a very serious matter! If you criticize others lightly, the same criticism will fall back upon you. In whatever matter you do not forgive or excuse others, the same matter will come back to haunt you! This surely has to do with God's governmental hand. The Lord said that if you do not forgive others of their sins, God will also not forgive you of your sins. This refers to governmental forgiveness. This forgiveness is different from other kinds of forgiveness. Matthew 18:35 uses the phrase My heavenly Father. The fact that a person can call God Father proves that the matter of eternal forgiveness with him has long been settled. If a brother offends such a one, and that one does not forgive his brother, God will not forgive him either. His governmental hand will come. Learn to be a generous and forgiving person! Learn to be generous to others and learn always to forgive. If you keep complaining about the conduct of others and continue to count the ill treatment you receive from them, please bear in mind that this will bring you into God's governmental hand and it will not be easy to come out! God will put you deeper into the hole. If you are severe toward others, God will also be severe toward you. When the slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, he seized him and took him by the throat. When his lord found out about this, he was unhappy with the slave. He delivered the slave to the torturers until the slave paid all that he owed (18:23-35). He would not be released until he paid all that he owed. God disciplined the unforgiving slave. God's governmental hand was upon him, and he could not easily get away.</p><p>We should not only be generous in forgiving others but also avoid criticizing or speaking about others in a light way. Please bear in mind that our criticism and careless comments about others often becomes a judgment upon ourselves. Then what will we do? When a brother deals harshly with others, we often find the Lord's discipline swiftly catching up with him. Perhaps he easily becomes sick. Sometimes a person may make a remark about someone's troublesome children, saying, "See how God's hand is always on this person." But after some time, the same thing happens to the one who criticized. What do we do when this happens? Brothers, I hope that we will learn to fear God's governmental hand. We have to learn to fear God. We have to be careful with our words, for many things can happen to us as a result of our careless words.</p><p>I can tell you today that the Christian life is a life of learning God's government. As Christians, we may live many years on earth. During these years God puts us under His training and teaches us the lesson of His discipline. We must not call ourselves children of God yet refuse to yield ourselves to His discipline. Please bear in mind that no one should criticize or speak about anything in a light way. I hope we will pick up the habit of shunning idle things and idle talk. Learn to be godly persons. It is not wise to incur God's governmental judgment. It is very serious and sobering. We should be careful not to take other people's affairs upon ourselves. Whatever we lightly condemn about others will soon become a condemnation upon us. We reap what we sow. This is something very real among God's children. I hope that we will learn to be generous persons in the eyes of God. The wise ones are the generous ones. The more generous we are to others, the more generous God will be to us. I know what I am talking about. If we are mean and severe to our brothers, God will also be mean and severe to us. You must learn to be kind, loving, and generous to your brothers. Give others liberty in many things. Stop all idle talk and criticism. When others are in trouble, it is the time for us to help them, not the time for us to criticize them.</p><p>Please bear in mind that the Jews will be tormented and imprisoned during the end time. They will have no clothes and nothing to eat. The sheep will be the ones who will visit them in prison, who will give them clothes when they are naked, and who will give them food when they hunger. These charitable acts will give them the ground to receive grace. We must not say that since God has ordained that they go through persecution and suffering, we will do our part by adding suffering to them. God indeed has ordained the suffering, but we must be generous to them. We cannot say that we will add more sufferings to them because God has ordained their persecution and affliction. Governmental discipline is God's concern. God's children in this age must learn to always treat people generously and compassionately. If we do this, the Lord will forgive us in many things.</p><p>There are many brothers who have fallen miserably today for one reason only&mdash;they have criticized others too severely in the past. Many of their weaknesses today are the very weaknesses they criticized in the past. God will not let such matters go easily! We must be generous toward others if we want to avoid God's governmental hand! May we learn to love and forbear one another. We must always ask God for mercy in dealing with our foolishness and weakness, both in our walk and in everything we do. We do not want to fall into His governmental hand! We must look to God's mercy again and again. We must learn to realize that we live by God's wisdom! We must say to God, "I am a foolish man. Everything I do results in nothing but foolishness. I can do nothing. If I fall into Your governmental hand, I will not be able to bear it. Be merciful to me!" The more pliable and humble we are, the easier it will be for us to be delivered from our afflictions. The more arrogant, stubborn, and self-assured we are, the harder it will be for us to come out of them. Therefore, we must learn to humble ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. BEING HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT, AND "IN DUE TIME,"<br />GOD'S GOVERNMENTAL HAND BEING WITHDRAWN</h2><p>Should we fall into God's governmental hand, for any reason great or small, the last thing we should do is rebel. Rebellion is foolishness! There is only one principle we can act upon when we fall into God's hand; that is, to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand. If we truly humble ourselves under God's mighty hand, He will relieve and release us "in due time." When God feels that events have run their course, He will let us go. I would like to draw attention to the words in due time. First Peter 5:6 says, "Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time." The emphasis here is in due time. God will open a way for us in due time. He will direct us to a straight path in due time. He will release us in due time, and He will exalt us in due time.</p><p>The mighty hand of God in this verse specifically refers to the matter of discipline. His hand here is not for protection. If it were for protection, the verse would say, "The eternal arm of God." Here we are the ones who humble ourselves under God's mighty hand. This implies obedience. Here is God's mighty hand. We cannot shake off such a hand! We cannot resist it. Instead, we must learn to humble ourselves under it by saying, "Lord! I am willing to obey. I will not resist You no matter where You put me. I accept everything, and I accept it willingly! I have nothing to say about the way You are treating me. I am willing to obey Your word! No matter how long You keep me in this condition, I am willing to obey!" Then we will see that there is a "due time." We do not know how long it will be. But at a certain time, the Lord will let us go, and He will move the church to pray for us and release us.</p><p>May we all know God's government from the very beginning. Many problems develop because men are ignorant of God's government. I hope that God's children will know His government from the first day, the first year, of their Christian life. If they do, they will be able to go on in a very proper way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:4-13</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />OF THOSE UNDER DISCIPLINE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Struggling against Sin,<br />Having Not Yet Resisted unto Blood</h2><p>Let us consider Hebrews 12:4-13, point by point.</p><p>Verse 4 says, "You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin." In this verse the apostle said that the Hebrew believers had struggled against sin. But even though they had suffered much, gone through great trials, encountered various problems, and met with much persecution, they had not yet resisted unto blood. If we compare these sufferings with that of our Lord, they are quite light! Verse 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross. What a believer goes through is far less severe than what the Lord went through! The Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross unto the shedding of blood. Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Finding the Reasons for Our Sufferings</h2><p>What should a person expect after he becomes a Christian? We should never put a false hope before the brothers. We should show them that we will encounter many problems. However, God's purpose and meaning are behind all of them. We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations? Unless the Lord grants us the privilege of becoming martyrs, we will probably not have the chance to resist and struggle against sin "unto blood." But even though it is not a resistance unto blood, we are nevertheless resisting! Why do these things happen to us?</p><h2 class="head2">C. Not Fainting nor Regarding Lightly</h2><p>Verses 5 and 6 say, "You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, `My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"</p><p>The apostle quoted Proverbs in the Old Testament in this portion of the Word. He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint. A believer should adopt these two attitudes. Some regard difficulties, sufferings, and God's discipline as insignificant matters. They do not think much of them and easily allow God's discipline to slip by. There are also some who faint when they go through the Lord's reproach and fall into His hand. As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life. They expect their way to be smooth. Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments. It never occurred to them that Christians would experience all kinds of difficulties. They are not prepared to be Christians under such circumstances. They faint and waver at the difficulties along the way. Proverbs shows us that both of these attitudes are wrong.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Not Regarding Lightly the Discipline of the Lord</h2><p>God's children should not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord. If the Lord disciplines us, we have to pay attention to it. Everything the Lord measures to us has a purpose and meaning to it. He wants to build us up through our experiences and environment. All of His discipline is for the purpose of perfecting us and making us holy. All of His discipline works His nature into our nature. As a result, we become disciplined in our character. This is the purpose of the Lord's discipline. He does not discipline us without reason. He disciplines us for the purpose of making us vessels. The Lord does not allow suffering to come to His children without a cause. We do not suffer for the purpose of suffering. He does not give us tribulation simply to make us suffer. The purpose in all our suffering is that we would partake of God's holiness and nature. This is the goal of discipline.</p><p>Many children of God have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to God's discipline. They never say, "The Lord is disciplining me. He is dealing with me, chastising me, and molding me into a vessel." They do not see the purpose of God's chastisement, dealing, and carving work. They go through their experiences capriciously. They are not bothered by what they see today; they let it slip by. They are not bothered by what they see the next day; they are not concerned about what the Lord's will is, and they disregard it time after time. To them it is as if God purposelessly allows people to suffer. Please bear in mind that the first reaction of God's children should be to respect and honor God's discipline. The first thing we should do when we experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened this way? We must learn to respect and honor God's discipline. We should not regard it lightly. To regard it lightly is to be careless about it. It is to say that God can do whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly and aimlessly.</p><p>On the one hand, we should not regard the discipline lightly. On the other hand, we should not make too much of it. If the Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too much of a discouragement to us. This is to make too much of our discipline. We must learn to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are always meaningful. At the same time, we must not be discouraged by discipline.</p><h2 class="head1">II. WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES</h2><p>Verse 6 says, "`For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'" This is a quotation from Proverbs. It reveals the purpose of the Lord's discipline.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Discipline Being the Arrangement of Love</h2><p>God does not have the spare time to deal with all the people of the world. He disciplines only those whom He loves. He disciplines us because He loves us. He disciplines us because He wants to make us vessels. God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them. Therefore, discipline is God's provision of love. Love arranges the environment that we should be in. We call this arrangement His discipline. Love measures everything that comes our way. It orders the things that we encounter in our daily life. This measurement is His discipline. Discipline is for our greatest profit and for bringing us to the loftiest goal in God's creation.</p><p>"And He scourges every son whom He receives." All those who are disciplined have the ground to say that they are received by God. Scourging is not a sign of God's rejection; it is a proof of His acceptance. I say again, God does not have the time to deal with everyone; He wants to spend His time on the sons whom He loves and receives.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Discipline Being the Father's Education</h2><p>Once you become a Christian, you should be prepared to accept discipline from God's hand. If you are not His child, God will let you go. He will allow you to live an undisciplined life and walk your own way. But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline. No father has the time to discipline another man's child. Whether his neighbor's son is good or bad is not of his concern. A good father, however, will always discipline his own son in a definite way. He will deal with his son strictly according to guidelines that he has set in his mind. He will not discipline his son in a mindless and haphazard way. He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations. The father puts together a certain curriculum to discipline his son. He molds his son into a certain character. In the same way, since the day we were saved, God has been arranging a curriculum for us. He wants us to learn certain lessons so that we will be conformed to His nature. He wants us to be like Him in many things. This is why He arranges, disciplines, and scourges. His goal is to make us a certain kind of person.</p><p>At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him. He has made many provisions in the environment and has ordered many things, experiences, and sufferings for the purpose of producing a certain kind of character and disposition. This is what God is doing today. He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way.</p><p>The minute we become Christians, we have to realize that God's hand is guiding us in all things. The ordained circumstances will come, and the scourgings will come. As soon as we get off the right way, His scourges will be upon us and will goad us back to the way. Every child of God should be prepared to accept God's disciplinary hand. God disciplines us because we are sons. God does not waste His time on others. He has no time to discipline those who are not His beloved sons. God has no time to reprove those who are not yet accepted as sons. Scourging and discipline are expressions of God's love and acceptance. Only Christians can have a share in God's scourging and discipline.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Discipline Not Being a Punishment but a Glory</h2><p>What we are receiving is discipline; it is not punishment. Punishment is for the retribution of one's mistakes, while discipline is for the purpose of education. Punishment comes because we have done something wrong; it responds to the past. Discipline is also related to our mistakes, but it is something for the future. Discipline bears an element of the future; it has a purpose. We have been called into the name of the Lord today; we belong to Him. Now we must be prepared to allow God to make us vessels of glory to Him. I can say with much confidence that God wants every one of His children to glorify Him in certain areas. Every child of God should glorify Him. However, each one does it in a different way. Some will glorify Him in one way, some in another way. We glorify God through different circumstances. As a consequence, God is glorified in a full way. Everyone has his own part and his own specialty. God wants to create a certain kind of character in us for the purpose of glorifying Him. No one is exempt from God's disciplinary hand. Such a hand works to accomplish the things of God. We have never seen a child of God who was exempt from His disciplinary hand.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Ignorance of Discipline Being a Great Loss</h2><p>It is indeed a great loss if God's children do not understand His discipline. Many people live a foolish life in the eyes of God for many years. They have no way to go on. They do not know what the Lord wants to do in them. They walk according to their own will and wander in a wild, unrestrained, and aimless way through the wilderness. God does not operate this way. He is a God of purpose. He does things for the purpose of molding a specific character in us so that we may glorify His name. All discipline is for the purpose of bringing us on in this way.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ENDURING FOR GOD'S DISCIPLINE</h2><p>The apostle quoted Proverbs when he wrote to the Hebrew believers. In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, "It is for discipline that you endure." This is the first New Testament explanation of the subject; it is a crucial word. Here the apostle shows us that endurance, suffering, and discipline are the same thing. God is disciplining us. The apostle shows us that this disciplining is the same as our endurance. It is for discipline that we endure.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Suffering Being God's Discipline</h2><p>Perhaps some will ask, "What is God's discipline? Why is He disciplining us?" Verses 2 through 4 speak of enduring the cross, despising the shame, and resisting sin, whereas verses 5 and 6 speak of discipline and scourging. What is the relation between these two things? What are the discipline and scourging in verses 5 and 6, and what are the shame, affliction, and resistance against sin in verses 2 through 4? Verse 7 is a conclusion of verses 2 through 6. It shows us that what we endure is God's discipline. Thus, suffering, shame, and affliction are God's discipline. Although our resistance against sin is not unto blood, the pain and tribulation are nevertheless part of God's discipline.</p><p>How does God discipline us? His discipline has to do with whatever He is bringing us through and whatever He is charging us to endure. Do not consider God's discipline as anything else. God's discipline is what we endure every day, things such as harsh words, an unkind face, a sharp tongue, an impolite retort, an unreasonable criticism, unexpected troubles, various kinds of shame, irresponsibility, infractions, and other more serious problems arising in the family. Sometimes it may be sickness, poverty, affliction, or difficulty. We encounter many things and endure many things. The apostle said that all these are God's discipline! It is for discipline that we endure.</p><h2 class="head2">B. No Experience Coming to Us by Accident</h2><p>The question today is: What kind of response do we have when others give us an ugly look? If their look is God's discipline, how should we react? If our business fails because others have forgotten to do something for us, how should we react? If the poor memory of another person is God's discipline to us, what should we do? If we become sick through another's infection, how should we deal with it? If things turn sour through various misfortunes, what do we say? If things do not go our way because God's discipline is behind them, what should we say? Brothers and sisters, the response to all these things makes a great difference in us! We can consider everything in our environment as being a mere encounter; this is one kind of attitude. We can also consider it to be God's discipline; this is another kind of attitude. The words of the apostle here are very clear. He says that it is for discipline that we endure. Please do not consider all these things to be unendurable. They are God's discipline. Do not conclude foolishly that they are mere coincidence. We must realize that God daily arranges these things and measures them for our discipline.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Discipline Being God's Dealing<br />with Us as with Sons</h2><p>Verse 7 continues, "God deals with you as with sons." God deals with us as with sons. "For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?" What we experience is God's discipline. Today all discipline comes to us because He deals with us as with sons. Please bear in mind that discipline is God's way of honoring us, not afflicting us. Many hold the wrong concept that they are disciplined by God because God wants to torture them. No! We are disciplined by God because God is honoring us. He deals with us as with sons. For what son is there whom the father does not discipline? Discipline is God's honoring of us! We have become God's sons; therefore, we must be disciplined. God disciplines us in order to bring us to the place of blessing and glory. We should never think that we are tormented by God. For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</p><h2 class="head2">D. Seeing the Father's Hand</h2><p>We see a big contrast when a person understands that what is happening to him is of God; he will have a different view toward his experience. If someone hits me with a cane today, I may argue with him or snatch the cane from him. I may break it and throw it back in his face. I have not done him any injustice in doing this. However, if my Father chastises me with the cane, can I snatch the cane, break it, and throw it back? I cannot do this. On the contrary, we feel somewhat privileged that our Father would discipline us. Madam Guyon said, "I will kiss the whip that chastises me! I will kiss the hand that buffets me!" Please remember that this is the Father's hand and the Father's rod. This is different. If it were some ordinary experience, we would not miss anything by rejecting it. But this is no ordinary encounter; this is God's hand and God's chastisement, the goal of which is to make us a partaker of His nature and character. Once we see this, we will not murmur and complain. As soon as a person realizes that his Father is the one who is dealing with him, his feelings change. Our God is dealing with us as with sons. It is a glory that He disciplines us today.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Discipline Being the Proof That We Are Sons</h2><p>Verse 8 says, "But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons." Remember that discipline is the proof that one is a son. God's sons are those who are disciplined by Him, and those who are without discipline are not His sons. A person has no proof that he is a son of God if he is not disciplined by God. The proof that one is a son is the discipline he receives.</p><p>All sons have become partakers of discipline. Every child of God needs to be disciplined, and you are no exception. Unless you are illegitimate, one who is adopted or bought, you must accept the same discipline! The apostle's word here is strong. All sons have become partakers of discipline. Do not expect to be treated differently if you are a son of God. All sons have become partakers of discipline. Everyone is treated the same way. Everyone who lived in Paul's time or Peter's time experienced this. Today this is true for everyone in every nation throughout the world. No one is exempted. You cannot take a way which no other child of God has ever walked. No child of God has ever taken a way that is free from discipline. If any child of God is foolish enough to think that there can be smooth sailing in his living and work and that he can be spared God's discipline, he is saying that he is illegitimate, that is, one who is adopted. We must see that discipline is the sign and proof that we are God's children. Those who are without discipline are illegitimate; they belong to other families and are not members of the household of God. If God does not discipline us, it means that we do not belong to His family.</p><p>Let me mention something that I once saw. It may not be that profound, yet it serves as a good illustration. Five or six children were playing rambunctiously together; their bodies were covered in mud. When the mother of three of the children came, she spanked her children on their hands and forbade them to dirty themselves again. After she spanked them, one asked, "Why did you not spank the others?" The mother answered, "They are not my children." No mother wants to discipline other people's children. It would be terrible if God did not discipline us! Those who are without discipline are illegitimate, not sons! We have truly believed in the Lord. Since the first day of our Christian life, chastisement has been coming our way. We cannot remain a child of God yet be spared discipline. We cannot receive the sonship of God without receiving chastisement. These two things go together. We cannot receive the sonship without accepting the discipline! All sons must be disciplined, and we are no exception.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. BEING SUBJECT TO THE DISCIPLINE<br />OF THE FATHER OF SPIRITS</h2><p>Verse 9 says, "Furthermore we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?" The apostle pointed out that the fathers of our flesh discipline us and we respect them. We acknowledge that their discipline is right, and we accept it. Shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</p><p>This shows us that the matter of sonship leads to the matter of discipline, and discipline issues in submission. Because we are sons, there is discipline; since there is discipline, there must also be submission on our part. God orders everything in our environment for the purpose of teaching us. It walls us in so that we have no choice but to take His way.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Subject to God in Two Matters</h2><p>We must obey God in two matters: One is to obey God's commandments, and the other is to obey His discipline. On the one hand, we have to obey God's word, that is, His commandments. We have to obey all of God's ordinances written in the Bible. On the other hand, we must subject ourselves to God's arrangement in the environment. We must obey His discipline. Often, obedience to God's word is enough. But there are times when we have to subject ourselves to God's discipline as well. God has ordered many things in our environment, and we must gain profit and learn lessons from these things. This is the profit God has ordained for us. He wants to lead us to the straight path. We must learn to obey not only His commandments but also His discipline. Obedience to God's discipline may involve a price, but it puts us on the straight path.</p><p>Obedience is not an empty word. Quite a number of the brothers ask, "What should I obey?" The answer to this question is simple. We may think that we have nothing to obey, but when God disciplines us a little, we immediately think of ways of escape. It is strange that many people seem to have no commandment to obey! Please bear in mind that when God's hand of discipline is upon us, that is the very time we have to obey. Some may ask, "Why do you not call God's hand the hand of guidance? Why do you call it the hand of discipline? Why do you not say that God is guiding us all the way, rather than God is disciplining us?" God knows how terrible our temper is, and we also know. There are many people to whom obedience will never come without proper discipline.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Learning Obedience through Discipline</h2><p>We should know the kind of person we are in the eyes of God. We are rebellious and stubborn by nature. We are like naughty children who will not obey unless their father has a rod in his hand. Every one of us is the same. Some sons will never obey unless they are rebuked or scourged. They have to be spanked before they will pay attention. Please bear in mind that this is the kind of person we are! We pay attention only when we are spanked. If we are not spanked, we turn our face the other way. This is why discipline is absolutely necessary. We should know ourselves. We are not that simple. Even a spanking may not change us that much. The apostle showed us that chastisement is for the purpose of humbling us and making us obedient. He said, "Be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live." Submission and obedience are indispensable virtues. We must learn to obey God and say, "God, I am willing to subject myself to Your discipline! Whatever You do is right!"</p><h2 class="head1">V. DISCIPLINE BEING FOR OUR BENEFIT</h2><p>Verse 10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them." Often parents discipline their children in a poor way, because they act and discipline according to their own whims. Not much benefit will come out of this discipline.</p><p>"But He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness." This is not a discipline driven by temper nor a discipline that is merely a punishment. No discipline or reproach of God is merely a punishment; it is educational in nature, and it is there for our profit. The purpose of discipline is not just to hurt us. The hurt produces something; it is there for a purpose. He does not punish us simply because we have done something wrong. Whoever thinks this way is altogether in the realm of the law and the courtroom.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Partakers of His Holiness</h2><p>What is the benefit of such discipline? It is to make us partakers of His holiness. This is glorious! Holiness is God's nature. We may say that holiness is also God's character. It is for this that God uses many ways to discipline His children. From the time we believed in the Lord, God has been disciplining us. He disciplines us with the view that we may partake of His holiness, His nature, and His character. The Bible speaks of a few kinds of holiness. The holiness in Hebrews specifically refers to God's character. For Christ to become our holiness is one thing. For us to be sanctified in Christ is another thing. The holiness spoken of here is something wrought into us; it is not a gift. It has to do with our constitution. This is something we have been emphasizing for years. This means that God works something into us in a gradual way. The holiness here is a holiness that is constituted through His discipline, something constituted through His scourging and daily, inner working. His discipline and operation are for the purpose of making us partakers of His holiness.</p><p>After we suffer a little chastisement, we partake of His holiness. After we suffer more chastisement, we learn more holiness. If we remain under God's discipline, we will gradually realize what holiness is. If we continue under God's discipline, there will be a gradual constitution of holiness into our character. If we stay under God's discipline all the way to the end, we will become holy in our character. Nothing is more crucial than this! We must realize that the result of discipline is the constitution of God's character into our being. All discipline has results, and we should reap the fruit from all of them. May the Lord be merciful to us so that His discipline, whenever it is upon us, may produce a little more holiness. May it result in more holiness, in more lessons learned, and in more constitution of God. Holiness must continually increase in us!</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Constitution of a Holy Character</h2><p>After we accept the Lord and become God's children, He daily arranges many things in our environment to discipline and chastise us. All these things are lessons to us. Time after time these lessons come to us for the purpose of adding His holiness to us. We need much discipline before God can work out a holy character in us! In the eyes of God we have only a limited number of years to live our Christian life. If we neglect God's discipline, and if it does not produce the needed effect in us, our loss will be an eternal loss indeed!</p><h2 class="head2">C. Holiness as a Gift<br />and Holiness as a Constitution</h2><p>God not only gives us His holiness as a gift, but He also wants us to partake of His holiness through His discipline. He wants us to be constituted with His holiness; He wants to wrought holiness into our being little by little. Carnal persons like us require years of discipline from God before His holy character and nature can become ours. We need all kinds of blows, situations, guidance, frustrations, urgings, and chastisement before we can partake of God's holy character. This is a great matter! God does not merely give us holiness as a gift. This holiness must be wrought into us. God has to constitute us with His holiness!</p><p>This is one distinctive feature of salvation in the New Testament. God first gives us something, and then He works the same thing into us. He constitutes us with the same thing little by little. When we have both aspects, we have full salvation. One is a gift from Christ, and the other is a constitution of the Holy Spirit. This is a distinctive feature of the New Testament. One is a gift, and the other is a constitution. Among all the crucial things in the New Testament, there is this clear statement: God is making us partakers of His holiness through His discipline.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />YIELDED THROUGH DISCIPLINE</h2><p>Verse 11 says, "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."</p><p>Here the apostle draws special attention to the words at the present time and afterward. It is a fact that one does not feel happy at the time of discipline, but grievous. Do not think that suffering is wrong when you experience God's discipline. Discipline is surely a suffering. The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy. It says rather that the cross is affliction. The cross brings us suffering. The Lord despised the shame for the joy set before Him. This is a fact. The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy; the cross is not a joy. It is always a suffering. It is not wrong to grieve and feel afflicted when we are disciplined.</p><p>But we must learn obedience. Only through obedience can we partake of God's holiness. Discipline indeed is not a matter of joy "at the present time." Instead, it is grief to us. This is not surprising; it is in fact quite normal for us to feel this way. Our Lord did not consider the trials a matter of joy when He passed through them. Of course, we can make it a matter of joy. Peter said that we can exult in various trials (1 Pet. 1:6). On the one hand, they are a suffering. On the other hand, we can reckon them to be a joy. How we feel is one thing, and how we reckon is another thing. We can feel grieved, but at the same time, we can reckon it to be a joy.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Yielding the Peaceable Fruit</h2><p>A child of God should fix his eyes not on the present but on the future. Pay attention to this sentence: "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it." Do not look at the suffering you are going through now. Instead, look at the resulting peaceable fruit of righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Moab Being at Ease from His Youth<br />and Settling on His Lees</h2><p>Jeremiah 48:11 says, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;/Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed." Are you clear what this is saying?</p><p>This is the problem with many who have not passed through trials. The passage describes those who have never suffered any chastisement or sufferings before the Lord. The Moabites had been at ease from their youth. They experienced no suffering or pain. What did such ease produce? They became like wine settled on its lees. If a person brews liquor from grapes or other kinds of fruit, the wine surfaces to the top, while the lees settle to the bottom. The wine floats, while the lees sink. In order to clear the wine, it has to be poured from vessel to vessel. If the lees remain at the bottom, sooner or later they will spoil the taste of the liquor. In making wine, a man must first allow the grapes to ferment. After the grapes ferment, he transfers the wine from one vessel to another. If he is not careful, he will pour the lees out as well. This is why he has to pour carefully. But one pouring is not enough; some lees are bound to escape into the other vessel. This is why he has to do this again. A second time may still not clear the lees, and he has to pour the wine into a third vessel. He has to keep pouring until no lees are left in the wine. God said that Moab had been at ease from his youth and had settled on his lees. He had not been emptied from vessel to vessel, and his lees always followed him. One must be emptied from vessel to vessel if he wants to do away with the lees. He has to be poured out again and again until one day the lees at the bottom are gone. Moab was full of lees; although he was clear at the top, he was not emptied at the bottom. Those who have never gone through trials and chastisement have never been emptied from vessel to vessel.</p><p>Often it seems as if God is digging a person from his roots. A brother may experience God's uprooting through his consecration; everything that he owns may be completely uprooted. A brother may experience God's uprooting through his sufferings and trials; he may be stripped of everything he has. This is to be emptied from vessel to vessel. God's hand will crush us thoroughly. He does this in order to clear away our lees!</p><p>To be at ease is not a good thing. Brothers and sisters, God wants to purify us. This is why He disciplines and scourges us. Never consider ease and comfort to be something good. Moab's ease caused him to remain Moab forever!</p><h2 class="head2">C. Taste Remaining, Scent Not Changing</h2><p>Here are some sobering words: "His taste remains in him, /And his scent is not changed." Because Moab was not emptied from vat to vat, from pot to pot, and from vessel to vessel, and because he was never disciplined and dealt with by God, his taste remained in him and his scent never changed!</p><p>Brothers, this is why God has to work on you. He wants to take away your taste and change your scent. God does not want your own taste and scent. I once said that many people are "raw" because they are still in their original state. They have never changed. You had a certain kind of taste before you believed in the Lord. Today you may have been a believer for ten years, yet your taste is still the same. Your scent remains the same as it was before you believed in the Lord. The word scent in Hebrew means "smell," which is the flavor of something in its original state. You had a certain smell before you were saved. Today you have the same smell; there is no change in you at all. In other words, you have not experienced any of God's constitution and carving.</p><p>God's discipline is indeed precious! He wants to uproot us and to empty us from vessel to vessel. God disciplines us and deals with us in many ways so that we may lose our original smell and yield the peaceable fruit. The peaceable fruit of righteousness can be translated as "the peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness."</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Peaceable Fruit<br />Being the Fruit of Righteousness</h2><p>Please remember that the fruit is peaceable. A man must be at peace with God in order to obtain this fruit. The worst thing one can do is to murmur, to lose his peace, and to rebel during times of discipline. One can be grieved by the discipline, but he should not murmur or rebel. The problem with many people is that they have no peace. This is why we need the peaceable fruit when we are under discipline. If you want the peaceable fruit, you must first learn to accept the discipline. You must learn not to fight with God or argue with Him. The peaceable fruit is the fruit of righteousness. Once you have the fruit of peace, you have the fruit of righteousness. This is why the apostle said, "The peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness." Peace is righteousness. If the inward fruit is peace, the outward expression is righteousness. If you have the fruit of peace within, you will spontaneously partake of God's holiness.</p><p>I hope that none of us would be like Moab, who was at ease from his youth and who had settled on his lees. He had not been emptied from vessel to vessel and had never gone into captivity. Therefore, his taste remained in him and his scent was not changed. Some have been Christians for ten or twenty years and have remained the same throughout this time. They have not accepted any of God's dealings and have not subjected themselves to them. Thus, their taste remains the same. If our scent remains the same for ten or twenty years, it means that we have never yielded any peaceable fruit before God and have never been constituted with a holy character. Our hope is that God would constitute us with something, something called a holy character.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. CONCLUSION</h2><p>Hebrews 12:12-13 says, "Therefore set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees, and make straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed." Sometimes it seems that discipline makes the hands hang down and the knees paralyzed. But the apostle told us not to be disheartened. The hands may hang down and the knees may be paralyzed, but there is the fruit of peace and the fruit of righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Setting Straight the Hands and the Knees</h2><p>Do not think that after a person suffers much hardship and discipline, there is nothing more to be done. After we are disciplined and scourged, we need to set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees. Discipline and scourging will yield the fruit of peace. This fruit of peace is the fruit of righteousness. If a person is at peace with God, he will have righteousness. As soon as we calm ourselves down and submit to God, everything becomes right and proper. As soon as we humble ourselves, we become constituted with a holy character. The fruit of peace is the fruit of righteousness. Do not set your eyes on righteousness. Just consider whether or not you are at peace, and whether or not you are obedient and pliable. If you are pliable and obedient, and if you are at peace, you will surely be constituted with holiness. Please bear in mind that even though you may have endured many trials and experienced many hardships in the past, there is still the need for you to set straight your hands which hang down and your paralyzed knees.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Making Straight the Paths</h2><p>At the same time, you need to "make straight paths for your feet." Today we can say that we have somewhat passed through this way. We are presenting this way clearly before you. "That what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed." Those who are falling behind do not need to be put out of joint any longer; they can be healed and join the others who have passed the same straight course. If a person goes through trials and humbles himself under God's mighty hand, he will find his character constituted with holiness. He will also lead many to this straight course; they will no longer be put out of joint but will be healed.</p><p>If a brother is before us and he veers off, his deviation may discourage others from finding the right course. This is why we must be obedient ourselves. We must bear the fruit of peace ourselves. This will not only ensure that we are on the right course, but also will open up the right course for others to follow. All the lame ones can take this way; they can all be healed. I recall the lame man in Acts 3. When his feet were made strong and he began to walk, he stood up, walked, leaped, and praised God. A lame man was healed, but there are many lame ones in this world today. They can all be healed by the straight course we take. We must open a way for all the brothers to follow.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:28; Matt. 10:29-31; Jer. 48:11; Gen. 47:7-10</h1><p>We have believed in the Lord and have received a new life. But there are many habits which we acquired before we believed in the Lord. Many character traits and aspects of our disposition were part of us before we believed in the Lord. Those habits, character traits, and disposition have now become a frustration to the expression of the new life. This is the reason many people do not touch the new life or experience the Lord when they meet us. Often, others touch our old person. We may be very clever, but our cleverness is an unregenerated cleverness. We may be very warm, but that warmth is an unregenerated warmth. We may meet someone who is very gentle or very quick, but their gentleness and quickness are unregenerated gentleness and quickness. These old traits frustrate others from touching the Lord.</p><p>From the day we were saved, the Lord has been doing two things in us. On the one hand, He is tearing down our old habits, character, and disposition. This is the only way for Christ to express His life freely through us. If the Lord does not perform this work, His life will be frustrated by our natural life. On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is creating a new nature and a new character in us little by little, with its new living and new habits. The Lord is not only tearing down the old but also constituting us with the new. There is not only a negative tearing-down work, but also a positive constituting work in us. These are the two aspects of the Lord's work in us after our we are saved.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD BEING THE ONE WHO DOES THE WORK</h2><p>After they are saved, many believers realize that their own person needs to be completely torn down. Yet they are too clever; they try to use artificial means to tear down their old nature, character, and habits. But the first thing God will tear down is our artificial means. Brothers and sisters, it is futile and even troublesome to use human energy to try to tear down the very nature, character, and habits which were built up by human energy in the past. We must realize from the very beginning that everything of the past must be torn down. But we cannot tear it down ourselves. Man's own effort to tear himself down will only result in outward adornment; it will only hinder the growth of the spiritual life. We do not need to tear ourselves down; God will do it for us.</p><p>We must be clear that it is God who wants to do this and God who does it. We do not have to come up with a way to deal with ourselves. God wants us to commit the entire work into His hands. We must be firmly impressed with this fundamental concept. God will work on us if He is merciful to us. God will order an environment that tears down our outward man. God knows how much there is that needs to be destroyed. He also knows our stubborn and strong spots. We may be too fast, too slow, too loose, or too legal in certain areas. Only God knows our need; no one else knows, not even ourselves. God is the only One who knows us thoroughly. We must allow Him to do the work.</p><p>In order to clarify the breaking and constituting work in us, we will use the phrase the discipline of the Holy Spirit for now. Although our whole environment is ordered by God, it is the Holy Spirit who applies this arrangement to us. God arranges the outward environment, but the Holy Spirit translates this arrangement into something inward and applies it to us. This conversion of outward events to inward experience is called the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, God orders the environment through the Holy Spirit; He does not order our lives directly but rather does so through the Holy Spirit. The dispensation between the Lord's ascension and His coming again is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. In this dispensation all of God's work is carried out through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit arranges everything in the environment and provides inward guidance to God's children. There are a few passages in the book of Acts which say that the Holy Spirit prompted, stopped, and forbade. We call the environmental arrangements of the Holy Spirit and the inner prompting, stopping, and forbidding "the discipline of the Holy Spirit." This means that the Holy Spirit is disciplining us through all these experiences.</p><p>This discipline is not only for our guidance but also for our disposition. It involves not only our ways but also our character. We have a new life within us; the Spirit of God is dwelling in us. He knows what we need, and He knows the kind of experience that will bring us the most benefit. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is God's ordering of the proper environment through the Holy Spirit in order to meet our need and accomplish His work of breaking and constituting us. Thus, the discipline of the Holy Spirit destroys our natural disposition and habits and brings in the constitution of the Holy Spirit in maturity and in sweetness.</p><p>Our environment is altogether arranged by God. Even our hairs are numbered. If no sparrow falls on the ground without our Father's permission, how much more is our environment under His caring hand? A harsh word, an unkind gesture, a misfortune, an unfulfilled wish, a sudden loss of health, an abrupt departure of loved ones&mdash;all these are measured by the Father. Whether it be happiness, affliction, health, sickness, joy, or pain, everything that comes our way is approved by the Father. God arranges the environment for the purpose of destroying our old character and disposition and reconstituting us with a new character and disposition. God arranges the necessary environment for us, and unconsciously, we are broken and the Holy Spirit is constituted into us so that we acquire a character and disposition that resembles God. This God-like character and disposition will be expressed through us day by day.</p><p>As soon as we believe in the Lord, we should be clear about a few things: First, we need to be torn down, and then we need to be built up again. Second, we do not do the tearing-down and building-up work ourselves; God arranges the environment to tear us down and build us up.</p><h2 class="head1">II. HOW GOD ARRANGES EVERYTHING</h2><p>How does God arrange everything for our good?</p><p>Everyone is different in nature, character, living, and habit. This is why we all need a different kind of breaking work. The kinds of discipline that God arranges are as varied as the number of people there are. Everyone is put into a different set of situations. A husband and a wife may be very close to each other, yet God will arrange a different environment for each of them. A father and a son, or a mother and a daughter, may likewise be very close to each other. Yet God arranges a different environment for each of them. In operating through our environment, God measures discipline to each one of us according to our individual needs.</p><p>Every arrangement of God is with the view of training us. Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose." In Greek all things means "everything." All does not mean a hundred thousand things or even a million things. We cannot tell how big the number is. Everything, all things, are arranged by God for our good.</p><p>Therefore, nothing comes to us by accident. With us there is no coincidence. All things are arranged by God. From our point of view, our experience may seem confusing and puzzling; we may not see the intrinsic meaning behind everything, and we may not understand what it means. But God's Word says that all things work together for our good. We do not know what thing will bring us what kind of good. Neither do we know how many things are waiting for us and what good we will gain from them. But there is one thing we do know: Everything works together for our good. Nothing will happen to us that does not bring us good. We must see clearly that God's arrangement is to produce holiness in our character. We do not work out this holiness in ourselves; God is the One who creates this holy character in us through our environment.</p><p>One illustration will serve to explain how all things work together for our good. In Hangchow there are many silk weavers. Weaving involves many threads and colors. If one looks at the fabric from the back, everything seems to be a mess. An outsider will be puzzled; he will not know what pattern is on the other side of the fabric. But if he turns the fabric right side up, he will find beautiful figures, flowers, mountains, or rivers on it. Nothing is clear while the fabric is being woven; one sees only red and green threads moving back and forth. Likewise, our experience seemingly moves back and forth like a puzzle. We do not know what design God has in mind. But every "thread" which God uses, every discipline from His hand, has its function. Every color is there for a purpose, and the design is prearranged. God arranges our environment for the purpose of creating holiness in our character. Every encounter is meaningful. We may not be clear today, but one day we will be clear. Some of the things may not look that nice at the moment. But when we look back after some time, we will surely know why the Lord has done what He has done and what His purpose was for doing it.</p><h2 class="head1">III. OUR ATTITUDE</h2><p>What should our attitude be when we face all these things?</p><p>Romans 8:28 says, "All things work together for good to those who love God." In other words, when God works, it is possible for us to receive the good, and it is also possible for us not to receive the good. This is quite related to our attitude. Our attitude even determines how soon we will receive the good. If our attitude is right, we will receive the good immediately. If we love God, everything that is of God will work for our good. If a man claims that he has no choice of his own, that he asks nothing for himself, and that he only wants everything that God gives to him, he should have only one desire in his heart&mdash;to love God. If he loves the Lord in his heart, all of the things around him will work together in love and for his good, no matter how confusing they may seem.</p><p>When something happens to us and we do not have the love of God within us, when we crave and seek things for ourselves, or when we pursue private interests apart from God, the good that God has reserved for us will not come. We are very good at complaining, struggling, murmuring, and groaning about many things. Brothers and sisters, please bear in mind that although all things do work together for good, we will not receive the good immediately if our hearts do not love God. Many of God's children have indeed encountered many problems, but they have not received any good. They experience much discipline, and God has arranged many things around them, but these things do not result in any riches on their part. The only reason for this poverty is that they have other goals besides God. Their hearts are not pliable towards God. They do not feel God's love; neither do they love God. They have a wrong attitude. As a result, they may have received many dealings, yet nothing remains in their spirit.</p><p>May God be merciful to us that we learn to love Him from our hearts as soon as we become Christians. Being short in knowledge does not mean much, because the way to know God lies in love, not in knowledge. If a man loves God, he will know God even though he may lack knowledge. However, if he knows much but does not love God in his heart, all of his knowledge will not help him to know God. There is a good line in one hymn: "To bring thee to thy God,/Love takes the shortest route" (Hymns, #477). If a man loves God, whatever he encounters will turn out to his good.</p><p>Our heart must love God, and we must learn to know His hand and humble ourselves under it. If we do not see His hand, our eyes will be distracted by men. We will feel that others are wrong or have betrayed us. We will feel that our brothers, sisters, siblings, parents, and friends are all wrong. As we condemn everyone, we fall into disappointment and disillusion ourselves, and nothing works to our good. When we say that the brothers and sisters in the church are all wrong and that nothing is right and everything is wrong, we are gaining nothing for ourselves except anger and criticism. If we remember the Lord Jesus' word, that "not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father" (Matt. 10:29), and if we realize that everything is of God, we will humble ourselves under His hand and receive the good.</p><p>Psalm 39:9 says, "I was dumb; I did not open my mouth; /For You have done this." This is the attitude of one who obeys God. Because God has done it and because God has allowed it to come upon us for our good, we humble ourselves and say nothing. We will not say, "Why did that happen to others, and why is this happening to me?" When we love God and know His hand, we will not open our mouth. In this way we will witness God's breaking and constituting work in us.</p><p>Some may ask, "Should we accept everything from Satan's hand too?" The basic principle is that we will take whatever God allows to come upon us. As for attacks from Satan, we have to resist.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. BREAKING AND CONSTITUTING</h2><p>The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference. This is why the Bible charges, "Rejoice in the Lord always" (Phil. 4:4). We should rejoice in the Lord. This is the only way we can rejoice always. Besides the Lord, what can make us rejoice always? Why does God allow all the bad things to come upon us? What is His purpose for doing these things? His goal is to break down our natural life. If we read Jeremiah 48:11, we will be clear.</p><p>Jeremiah 48:11 says, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;/Nor has he gone into exile./Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed." The Moabites were the descendants of Lot (Gen. 19:36-37). They were related to Abraham but were of the flesh. Moab was at ease from his youth and never experienced any tribulation, trial, blow, suffering, or pain. Nothing happened to him that would cause him to shed tears; nothing ever rent his heart or frustrated his way. In man's eyes this is such a blessing. But what did God say about the Moabites? He said, "He is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel." For wine to settle on its lees means that the liquid is a mixture. When wine ferments, the top part becomes clear liquid, while the lees sink to the bottom. As soon as the vessel is shaken, the lees and the liquid mix together again. In order to have a clear liquid, one has to pour the wine from one vessel to another. In the old days there was no filter, and the only way to remove the lees was to pour the liquid from one vessel to another. The liquid and the lees were originally mixed together. By pouring the liquid from one vessel to another, the lees were left behind. Sometimes some lees would escape with the liquid to the other vessel, and there would be the need to pour the liquid to yet another vessel. This would go on and on until all the lees were gone. Moab was never emptied from one vessel to another. He was like wine settled on its lees. His "lees" were not yet removed. This is why it says that "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed." Moab always tasted like Moab. His scent remained the scent of Moab. His condition had not changed since the first day. But God is not after the old scent. He wants to change the scent.</p><p>Some have been believers for ten years, yet their taste remains the same as it was ten years ago. They are like Moab, whose taste remained and whose scent was not changed. Some people were sloppy when they first believed in the Lord. After twenty years they are still sloppy. They lived in ignorance and foolishness the first day, and they still live in ignorance and foolishness today. Their taste remains the same, and their scent is not changed. God does not want this. God wants to remove our old habit, nature, and character; He wants to remove every undesirable element in us. He wants to empty us from this vessel to that vessel and from that vessel to another vessel. After being emptied a few times, our "lees" will be left behind, and the original taste will be gone.</p><p>Moab had an easy life, but as a result, "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed." Perhaps our life is not as easy as Moab's. Perhaps we have not been "at ease from...youth." Perhaps we have had to go through "many tribulations" like Paul (Acts 14:22). If so, we should realize that the Lord is removing our lees and our original taste. The Lord wants to take away our own taste and natural scent. The old things must be torn down. The Lord has to uproot them all. He is pouring us from one vessel to another and then to a third. He allows this to happen to us today and that to happen to us tomorrow. The Lord turns us from one environment to another, from one experience to another. Each time He arranges an environment around us and breaks us, we will shed some of our old taste and scent. Time after time we will be purified of our old taste. Every day we will be a little different than the day before, and the next day we will be different still further. This is the way the Lord works in us; He tears down a little today and a little tomorrow, until all our lees are gone, our taste is lost, and our scent is changed.</p><p>God is not only breaking us on the negative side but also constituting us on the positive side. From the life of Jacob in Genesis, we can see the meaning of constitution.</p><p>Jacob's life began from a low point. He struggled with his older brother in his mother's womb and strove to be the firstborn by holding on to his brother's heel. He was crafty and greedy, always deceitful and taking advantage of others. He deceived his own father, brother, and uncle. But in the end he was deceived by his uncle and his sons. He tried his best to prosper, but in the end he found himself in a famine. We can say that Jacob's way was fraught with suffering. Some people spend their lives in ease and comfort, but Jacob's life was full of affliction.</p><p>While he was going through his sufferings, God was breaking him down again and again. He suffered one thing after another. Every experience he went through was a suffering to him. But thank God, after going through so much suffering in His hand, he finally acquired a touch of God's holiness. We see this when he was in Egypt. There we see a gentle, humble, bright, and dignified man. He was so meek and humble that he could ask for grace and mercy from his son. Yet he was so crystal clear that he could utter prophecies which Abraham could not utter. He could give blessings which Isaac could not give. He was so dignified that even Pharaoh bowed his head to receive his blessing. This shows us that through God's breaking work, the lowly Jacob had become someone God could use. Jacob had become a man of God!</p><p>After years of breaking, God constituted Jacob with Himself. This is why we can see such a beautiful picture at Jacob's deathbed when he leaned on the top of his rod and worshipped God. Though he was sick in bed, he could still lean on the top of his staff and worship God. This proves that he still remembered his pilgrim life and had not given up his pilgrim characteristic. At first he struggled to sit up, put his feet down by the bed, and prophesied. After prophesying, he gathered up his feet, gave up his breath, and died. The way he died was beautiful! This is indeed a beautiful picture.</p><p>We can muse carefully upon the whole life of Jacob. At the time he was born, I am afraid no one had a worse "taste" than he had. But when he left the world, his old taste was gone altogether. What we see is a man fully constituted by God.</p><p>We must realize that everything that comes upon us is for our edification one way or another. God tears us down through all kinds of sufferings. The tearing down can be quite painful. But after we pass through these trials, something will be constituted into us. In other words, when trials arise, it may appear that we are failing, but His grace will always carry us through. In the process of overcoming our trials, something is wrought into us. As we overcome our trials again and again, the constitution within us grows day by day. On the one hand, God puts us through difficult circumstances and tears us down through our trials. On the other hand, something is added into us as we rise from our trials.</p><p>Thank God that we have the discipline of the Holy Spirit. May God have mercy on us. May He break us and constitute us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we may reach maturity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">WITHSTANDING THE DEVIL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: James 4:7; 1 Pet. 5:8-9; 2 Cor. 2:11</h1><p>The devil is known also as Satan (Rev. 12:9). He was first a cherubim, created by God (Ezek. 28:12-14), and he was an archangel (Rev. 12:7; Matt. 25:41). Later, he rebelled against God by uplifting himself to be equal to God. Because of this, God judged him (Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:15-19) and he became Satan, the adversary of God. In the original text the word Satan means "an opposer, an adversary." The devil opposes everything that God does. In addition, he always sets himself against God's children.</p><p>We want to look at the way the devil attacks God's children and how they withstand him.</p><h2 class="head1">I. SATAN'S WORK</h2><p>We will look at Satan's work in four aspects.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Satan's Work in the Human Mind</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ." This shows us that Satan uses every high thing as a stronghold to surround man's thought. In order for the Lord to gain us, He must first overthrow the strongholds of Satan. He must do this before He can charge into man's thought and take it captive.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Satan's Reasonings and Temptations</h2><p>What are reasonings? This word in Greek can be translated "imagination" or "thought." Satan often surrounds us with many imaginations. Men are foolish; they think that these thoughts are their own. Actually, they are the strongholds of Satan, and they prevent the mind from submitting to Christ. Often Satan injects a kind of imagination into our mind. If we think this imagination is from ourselves, we fall into his snare. Often thoughts develop which have no basis in fact; they are merely imaginations. Many so-called sins are imaginary in nature; they are not real. Many of the so-called problems among the brothers and sisters come from our imagination; they have no factual basis. Often Satan injects a wild thought into our mind, and we are completely oblivious to his work. When he injects a sudden thought into our mind and we accept it, we are accepting his work. If we reject this thought, we reject his work. Many thoughts are not our own; they are actually concocted by Satan. We must learn to reject these thoughts from Satan.</p><p>Most of Satan's temptations come through the mind. Satan realizes that God's children will rise up and withstand him vehemently if he attacks openly. This is the reason he tempts us by sneaking in stealthily and planting a thought in our mind unconsciously. Once the thought gets into us, we begin to think about it. If the more we dwell on a thought the more we feel justified and right, we have fallen into his snare. The thought that we have accepted is Satan's temptation. If we reject Satan's attacks in our mind, we will shut off the most vulnerable entrance of his temptations.</p><p>Many problems among God's children are problems in the mind; they are not real problems. Sometimes when you see a brother or a sister, you may feel that he or she has a problem with you or that there is a distance between you. This may result in a barrier between you. Actually, there is nothing between you. The so-called problem is merely Satan's attack in your mind or the mind of your brother or sister. Such problems are unnecessary problems. God's children must reject sudden thoughts and sudden feelings. They must learn never to give in to Satan.</p><p>Here, we need to issue a warning. We should not be overly concerned about thoughts from Satan. There are people who go to one extreme of paying no attention at all to Satan's thoughts. There are also people who go to the other extreme of paying too much attention to thoughts from Satan. A person can easily be cheated if he is not alert to thoughts from Satan. At the same time, a person can lose his mental sanity if he is obsessed about thoughts from Satan. If a person pays too much attention to Satan's temptations, his mind will become confused, and he will easily become a prey to Satan's snares. As soon as a person's eyes are not focused on the Lord, he will find himself in trouble. On the one hand, we need to see that Satan does attack our mind. On the other hand, we need to realize that as soon as we reject his attacks, that is the end of them. If a person has to reject Satan day and night, something is wrong with his mind; he is heading down the wrong road. On the one hand, we must be familiar with his wiles; if we are ignorant of them we will be cheated. On the other hand, we cannot be overly concerned because that will also lead us into deception. As soon as our eyes are set on him, he has gained what he wants. This distraction will render us useless, and we will become obsessed with his thoughts day and night. Any brother or sister who is overly concerned with such thoughts has already been deceived. We must learn to maintain a proper balance. An excessive concern is wrong. If a person's mind is constantly worried about thoughts from Satan, he is in reality giving ground to Satan to enter into him. We must never go to the extreme.</p><h2 class="head3">2. How to Reject Thoughts from Satan</h2><p>How do we reject thoughts from Satan? It is easy to reject these thoughts. God has given us our mind; it is ours, not Satan's. We are the only ones who have the right to use our mind; Satan has no authority over our mind. All we need to do is not allow him to think. Satan can only usurp our mind with deception. He will give us a thought, and we may think that this thought is ours. Actually, it is from Satan. As soon as we recognize that it is not ours, we have overcome.</p><p>Satan always tempts and attacks a person by stealthy, surreptitious, and covert ways. He does not shout loudly, "Here I come!" Instead, he deceives with lies and falsehood. He does not let us know that he is the one who is doing the work. Once we are aware of an attack from Satan and expose him and his disguise, it will be easy to withstand him. The Lord Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" (John 8:32). The truth is the fact. We will be set free once we know the fact. The power of Satan is in his lies; once his lies fail, his power is gone. Therefore, as soon as we realize that Satan is attacking us and that this is the fact, we are freed. Some children of God say with their mouth that Satan is the instigator behind everything, but their spirit has no assurance that those things are actually from Satan. Although they say that they are withstanding Satan, they do not know the reality of Satan's work. As a result, they cannot withstand him. However, as soon as they identify Satan's work, they can withstand him, and as soon as they withstand him, he flees.</p><p>Satan attacks our mind mainly through deception. He makes us think that his thoughts are ours when in reality they are from him. Once we expose his lies, we will reject the thought from him. To withstand means to refuse. When Satan gives us a thought, we should say, "I do not want it." This is what it means to withstand. When he injects one thought into us, we should say, "I do not take this." When he injects another thought into us, we should repeat, "I do not accept this." If we do this, he will not be able to do anything with us. One servant of God in the Middle Ages said, "You cannot stop birds from flying over your head, but you can at least stop them from nesting in your hair." This is a good word. We cannot stop Satan from tempting us. However, we can stop him from nesting, from gaining a beachhead in us. This power is ours. If we ignore the thoughts that enter our mind, these thoughts will stop.</p><p>On the positive side, we need to exercise our mind. Many people have lazy minds. This makes it easy for Satan's thoughts to lodge in them. Philippians 4:8 says, "What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things." We can take account of spiritual matters. We need to exercise our mind concerning spiritual matters. If a person always sets his mind on sinful things, Satan can easily inject his thoughts into him, because his thoughts and Satan's thoughts are not much different. But if we always set our mind on spiritual things, Satan will not be able to inject his thoughts into us easily. Satan is able to inject his thoughts into many people because they are passive, because they have too much spare time, or because their thoughts are unclean in the first place.</p><p>There is another point that deserves attention: Our mind must not be attracted to satanic thoughts. There are many people whose minds are attracted to satanic thoughts. They have no interest in the wonderful, spiritual experiences of other brothers. Yet they become very interested when it comes to gossip. Since they love Satan's work, they cannot reject satanic thoughts. We need to hate Satan's work in order to reject his thoughts. All filthy thoughts that damage one's fellowship with the Lord and love for the Lord are from Satan. These thoughts will not come to us if we are not attracted to them in the first place. But if we incline our heart toward these things, they will come to us easily. Therefore, we must learn to reject everything that comes from Satan.</p><p>We must pay special attention to rejecting all filthy thoughts. Satan always places filthy thoughts in man to induce man to sin. The starting point is one filthy thought. If we allow it to continue, it will bear the fruit of sin. Therefore, we must refuse any thought that comes from Satan.</p><p>However, there is a great problem: What should we do if the thought refuses to leave after we have rejected it? We need to realize that we only need to withstand unwanted thoughts once. Withstanding is a one-time act; we should never withstand twice. James 4:7 says, "Withstand the devil, and he will flee from you." This verse says to withstand the devil and the devil will flee. We must believe that when we withstand the devil, he will flee. It is wrong to continue withstanding for fear that the devil is still around. Whose words do we believe? The Bible says, "Withstand...he will flee." If there is a voice within that suggests that he has not fled, whose voice is it? It is Satan's voice! Many people choose to believe Satan's words. Therefore, they lose. We must declare after we have withstood him, "I have already withstood the devil. He is gone from me." The feeling that he is still lurking around is a lie; it is not real, and it is not from the Lord. He must run. He has no ground to stay. We must be clear that it is right to withstand once, but wrong to withstand a second time. The first withstanding glorifies God's name. The second withstanding questions God's Word.</p><p>Many people make the mistake of checking with their feelings after they have withstood the devil. They ask, "Is the devil gone?" Their feeling tells them that he is not gone, and they try to withstand him again. Once there is a second withstanding, be sure there will be a third, a fourth, even a hundredth, and a thousandth. In the end we will feel as if we are completely helpless in rejecting it. But if we ignore him completely after we have withstood his temptation once, we will experience victory. We must care for the fact of God's Word and ignore our own feelings. The fact is that as soon as we withstand the devil, he flees. If we think that he has not fled after we have withstood him, we are being deceived by our feeling. If we believe this feeling, the devil will come back. We must learn to believe God's glorious words. Once we have withstood him once, there is no need to withstand him a second time because the matter has been settled already.</p><p>These are the issues relating to Satan's work in man's mind. We must realize that Satan attacks man's mind. We should reject any thought from Satan. At the same time, we should realize that once we reject his thoughts, the matter is finished. Furthermore, we must not be overly concerned with his attacks. Otherwise, our mind will be thrown into confusion, and we will be ensnared by the devil.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Satan's Work on Man's Body</h2><p>The Bible shows us clearly that many physical diseases are the result of Satan's attack.</p><p>The fever of Peter's mother-in-law was an attack from Satan, and the Lord Jesus rebuked the fever (Luke 4:39). Something must have a personality before the Lord can rebuke it. We cannot rebuke a cup or a chair; we can only rebuke something that has a personality. Fever is a symptom; the Lord could not rebuke the symptom. But Satan was behind the symptom with a personality of his own. Therefore, as soon as the Lord rebuked the fever, it was gone.</p><p>In Mark 9 we see a dumb and deaf child. In man's eyes dumbness and deafness are sicknesses. But the Lord Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, "Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more" (v. 25). The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses. We must realize that many sicknesses are medically defined diseases. But there are many sicknesses that are actually attacks from the devil. The Bible does not say that the Lord healed the sickness but that He rebuked it. The boils on Job's body could not be healed by medicine; they were not medical illnesses; they were attacks from the devil. Unless one first deals with the devil, he has no way to deal with such sicknesses.</p><p>We admit that illnesses often occur through man's negligence of natural laws. However, it can quite often be the result of Satan's attack. In such a case one only has to ask the Lord to rebuke the sickness, and it will go away. This type of sickness often comes and goes away suddenly. It is an attack from Satan rather than an ordinary illness.</p><p>The complication lies in the fact that Satan does not want us to uncover and expose the illnesses he has inflicted. He always hides behind natural symptoms and makes us think that every sickness is the result of natural causes. If we allow him to hide behind these natural symptoms, our illness will not go away. Once we expose his work and rebuke him, the sickness will go away. One Christian had a very high fever and suffered greatly. He could not sleep and did not understand what was happening to him. Later, he was convinced that it was Satan's work. He prayed to the Lord about it, and the next day the fever went away.</p><p>When a Christian becomes sick, he should first find the cause for his illness. He should ask: Is there any proper reason for this sickness? Is this out of natural causes or is it an attack from Satan? If there is not a proper reason for the illness and you discover that it is indeed an attack from Satan, you should withstand him and reject him.</p><p>The work of Satan on man's body results not only in illness but also in death. Satan was a murderer from the beginning, in the same way that he was a liar from the beginning (John 8:44). We should withstand not only Satan's sickness but also his murdering. All thought of death is from Satan. Every notion of death as a means to escape from anything is from Satan. Satan made Job think of death. He did this not only to Job but also to every child of God. All notions of suicide, death wishes, and premature death are temptations from Satan. He tempts man to sin, and he also tempts man to die. Even thoughts of danger during one's travels are Satan's attacks. We must reject these thoughts whenever they come and not allow them to remain in us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Satan's Work on Man's Conscience</h2><p>Revelation 12:10 says, "The accuser of our brothers...who accuses them before our God day and night." This shows us that part of Satan's work is to accuse us. This work is carried out in man's conscience. As soon as a person is saved, his conscience is quickened, and he begins to know sin. Satan knows this. He knows that the Holy Spirit touches the conscience of God's children concerning sin. He knows that He guides them into confession and prayer for forgiveness before God. Consequently, Satan steps in to counterfeit the Holy Spirit's work. He accuses man in his conscience. Such an attack is found frequently among God's children, and it causes much havoc.</p><p>Many children of God cannot differentiate between the Holy Spirit's reproach and Satan's accusation. As a result, they are hesitant to withstand anything. This gives Satan further ground to exercise his accusations. Many children of God could have been very useful in the hands of God, but their conscience has been weakened to the uttermost by Satan's attack. They are bombarded constantly with the accusation and feeling that they have sinned in this and that matter. They are unable to stand up before God or before men. As a result, they become spiritually handicapped for the rest of their lives.</p><p>It is true that we should pay attention to the reproach of the Holy Spirit once we become Christians. However, we also need to withstand Satan's accusation. We need to pay attention to the difference between the Holy Spirit's reproach and Satan's accusation. Many so-called reproaches are counterfeits; they are, in fact, Satan's accusations.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Difference between Satan's Accusation<br />and the Holy Spirit's Reproach</h2><p>What is the difference between Satan's accusation and the Holy Spirit's reproach? We need to distinguish between them.</p><p>First, all reproaches from the Holy Spirit begin with a small feeling from within. This inner feeling becomes stronger and stronger and convicts us of our mistakes. Satan's accusation, however, is a continual nagging within. The reproach of the Holy Spirit grows stronger and stronger as time goes on; the accusation of Satan is the same from beginning to end. As time passes, the inner sense of the Spirit ascends by degree; but the accusation of Satan is a constant, muddled nagging that stays the same from beginning to end.</p><p>Second, each time we yield to the rebuke of the Spirit, we find the power of sin diminishing in us. Each rebuke of the Spirit diminishes the power of sin a little. Therefore, any rebuke from the Spirit weakens the power of sin; it results in a diminishing of sin. This is not the case with Satan's accusation. Every time he accuses us, we find the power of sin to be just as great as before.</p><p>Third, the reproach of the Holy Spirit brings us to the Lord, whereas Satan's accusation brings us disappointment. The more we are reproved by the Holy Spirit, the more we are strengthened within to deal with our problem before the Lord. But Satan's accusation brings about despair and resignation. The reproach of the Holy Spirit causes us to come before the Lord and to rely on Him; Satan's accusation causes us to turn back to ourselves and to be disappointed.</p><p>Fourth, if it is the reproach of the Holy Spirit, confession before the Lord will follow. This confession will result in at least peace, if not joy. There may or may not be joy, but there is always peace. Satan's accusation, however, is totally different. There is no joy and no peace, even after one confesses his sins. This is like coming out of a major illness or going through a theatrical performance&mdash;nothing remains after the act is over. The reproach of the Holy Spirit has a result&mdash;peace, if not joy. However, Satan's accusation leads us nowhere.</p><p>Fifth, the reproach of the Holy Spirit reminds us of the blood of the Lord. With Satan's accusation, there is always the Satan-injected thought: "There is not much use. Perhaps the Lord will not forgive you." This thought will be there even when we know that we have the blood. In other words, the reproach of the Holy Spirit leads to faith in the Lord's blood, while Satan's accusation causes us to lose our faith in the Lord's blood. When a certain feeling comes, simply check whether we are reminded of the blood as a result of this feeling or whether we have been distanced from the blood. This will tell us whether the feeling is a reproach of the Holy Spirit or an accusation from Satan.</p><p>Sixth, the result of the reproach of the Holy Spirit is power from God; one will rise up on his feet and run faster. He will go on with renewed zeal, cast aside his trust in himself, and have more faith in God. However, the result of Satan's accusation is the debilitation of the conscience. The conscience of such ones is smitten before God. They have no faith in themselves, and they have no faith in God either. It is true that the reproach of the Holy Spirit takes away our strength and our trust in ourselves. But at the same time it causes us to have more faith in the Lord. Satan's accusation is not like this. It takes away our confidence in ourselves as well as our faith in the Lord. The result is that we become a debilitated person.</p><h2 class="head3">2. How to Overcome Satan's Accusation</h2><p>Revelation 12:11 says, "And they (the brothers) overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death." Him here refers to Satan, who accused the brothers. How do we overcome him?</p><p>First, we overcome by the blood of the Lamb. On the one hand, when we sin before the Lord, we must confess our sins. On the other hand, we must say to Satan, "There is no need for you to accuse me! I come before the Lord today by the blood of the Lord!" To overcome Satan, we must show him that we are forgiven through the blood of the Lamb. All our sins, major or minor, have been forgiven through the blood of the Lamb. This is the Word of God: "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7).</p><p>We must realize that the blood of the Lamb is the basis of our forgiveness before God as well as the basis of our acceptance in Him. We should not be so presumptuous as to think that we are good. Neither should we be so foolish as to condemn ourselves from morning to evening. It is foolish to be proud, and it is also foolish to keep looking at oneself. Those who consider themselves to be good are foolish, and those who are blind to the saving power of the Lord are foolish as well. Those who believe in their own power are foolish, and those who do not believe in the Lord's power are foolish as well. We must see that the blood of the Lamb has already fulfilled all the demands of God. It has also overcome all the accusations of Satan.</p><p>Second, we overcome because of the word of our testimony. This word of our testimony declares the spiritual facts; it declares the victory of the Lord. We must tell Satan, "There is no need for you to trouble me! My sins have been forgiven through the Lord's blood!" We need to exercise our faith to declare that Jesus is Lord and that He has won the victory. We need to speak out the word of our testimony and let Satan hear this word. We must not only believe in our hearts but also declare it to Satan with our mouth. This is the word of our testimony.</p><p>Third, we must not love our soul-life even unto death. "The blood of the Lamb" and "the word of their testimony" spoken of previously are two conditions for victory over Satan. The refusal to love one's soul-life even unto death is an attitude. No matter what Satan is doing, even if he is putting us to death, our attitude should be such that we still trust in the blood of the Lamb and still declare His victory. Satan's accusation will stop if we stand fast in this way. He cannot overcome us. Instead, we will surely overcome him!</p><p>Some brothers and sisters receive so much accusation from Satan that they can no longer discern whether it is an accusation from Satan or a reproach of the Holy Spirit. They should stop confessing their sins for a while; the Lord does not want us to do things foolishly. Instead, they should pray to the Lord and say, "If I have sinned, I will confess my sins and ask for Your forgiveness. But now I am under Satan's accusation. I pray that You cover all my sins. From this point on, everything is under Your blood, and I will not be bothered by anything anymore, whether it be sin or otherwise!" Those who are in such a condition must forget about everything for a while before they can differentiate clearly between Satan's accusation and the Holy Spirit's reproach.</p><h2 class="head3">3. How to Help Those Who Are<br />under Satan's Accusation</h2><p>We must never add to the burden of the conscience of those under Satan's accusation. First, we should help them to do only what is within their ability to handle. If we ask them to do what is beyond their ability, they will fall easily into condemnation. We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead. Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord's word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person. If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.</p><p>We must not be careless in pointing out the failures of others. Suppose a brother has failed in certain areas, yet he can still pray, read the Bible, and attend the meetings. As long as you have the assurance within that you can help him, a little push may be all that is necessary to bring him through his trouble. But if you do not have the assurance within and you do not have the power to uplift him, your exposure of his failures will only quench his prayers, his reading of the Bible, and his meeting life. The smoking flax must be rekindled; it must not be smothered. The bruised reed must be supported; it must not be broken. We should not make ourselves the standard and put the conscience of others under condemnation. We must learn not to do things that would offend the conscience of others.</p><p>We must point out Hebrews 10:22 to those who are under Satan's accusation: "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." With such a sprinkling, our conscience should no longer feel guilty. The principle of the Christian life is a life free from any condemnation in the conscience. When a Christian is condemned in his conscience, he will be weak before God and will be debilitated in all spiritual matters. Satan's goal is to derail us from this principle. This is the reason he accuses us unceasingly. We need to lay hold of this principle by applying the blood. The more Satan tries to make us feel guilty, the more we should apply the blood to all of our sins. The brothers overcame him not by their own strength, but by the blood of the Lamb. We can declare, "Satan, I admit that I have sinned. But I have been redeemed by the Lord! I have never denied that I am a debtor. I am in debt, but the Lord has paid my debt!" We do not need to deal with Satan's accusation by denying that we are debtors. We can deal with him by declaring that our debt has been paid.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Satan's Work in the Environment</h2><p>All circumstances are arranged by God. However, there are many things in our environment which, though permitted by God, are the result of Satan's direct and active work.</p><p>Take Job's experience as an example. His oxen and don- keys were taken away, his house collapsed, and his children were killed. These were all things in the environment. Though they were permitted by God, Satan was the one directly instigating the attacks.</p><p>Peter's failure was another example. The cause of his fall was partly due to himself, but partly due to Satan's attack in the environment. The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat" (Luke 22:31). Peter's fall was the direct result of Satan's work. Yet it was something permitted by God.</p><p>Paul's thorn was clearly the work of Satan. Paul said, "There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me" (2 Cor. 12:7). This is the work of Satan. It is Satan who attacks God's children in the environment.</p><p>An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea. He knew that powerful demons had to be cast out on the other side of the sea. After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves. The Lord was asleep. The disciples came near and roused Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" (v. 25). A few of the disciples were fishermen; they were very experienced sailors. However, they realized that the waves were more than they could handle. The Lord Jesus rebuked their little faith; then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea. The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them. Satan had stirred up the winds and the waves.</p><p>In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment.</p><p>How should we react to Satan's attack in the environment?</p><p>First, we must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. Both James 4 and 1 Peter 5 tell us to withstand Satan. These two portions also tell us to humble ourselves before God. When Satan attacks us in the environment, our first reaction should be to submit to God. We cannot withstand the devil if we do not submit to God. Our conscience will condemn us if we withstand the devil without submitting to God. Therefore, our first reaction should be to submit to God.</p><p>Second, we should withstand the devil. When God's children encounter unreasonable and inexplicable things in the environment and have the clear sense within that these are attacks from Satan, they should withstand him. Once they withstand, the attacks will be behind them. On the one hand, they need to humble themselves under the hand of God. On the other hand, they must withstand Satan's work in the environment. When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work. Thus, they will be able to differentiate God's arrangement from Satan's attack. Once they are clear and once they withstand the devil, the attacks will go away.</p><p>Third, we must reject all forms of fear. Satan has to find a lodging ground before he can work on God's children. He cannot work where he has no ground to work. Therefore, his first attack is to gain a beachhead. He then attacks us from this beachhead. We should not give any ground to him. This is the way to victory. There is one area which can become Satan's greatest stronghold&mdash;fear. When Satan tries to put us through trials, the first thing he does is to put fear into us. An experienced sister once said, "Fear is Satan's calling card." Once you accept fear, Satan steps in. If you reject fear, he will not be able to come in.</p><p>All thoughts of fear are attacks from Satan. Whatever you are afraid of, you will surely experience. Job said, "For I dread something, and it comes upon me;/And what I fear comes to me" (Job 3:25). Job experienced everything that he feared. Satan's attack in the environment comes mostly in the form of fear. If you withstand the fear, the things that you fear will not come. But if you allow the fear to remain, you will give Satan the opportunity to do the very things that you fear.</p><p>Therefore, in order for God's children to withstand the work of Satan, the first thing they have to reject is fear. When Satan puts a fear in you for this or that thing, you must not give in to this fear. You should say, "I will never accept what the Lord has not measured to me!" Once a person is delivered from fear, he is delivered from Satan's realm. This is what Paul meant when he said, "Neither give place to the devil" (Eph. 4:27).</p><p>Why do we not need to fear? We do not fear "because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). If we are fearful, it is because we are ignorant of this fact.</p><h2 class="head1">II. WITHSTANDING SATAN BY FAITH</h2><p>First Peter 5:8-9 says, "Be sober; watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour. Him withstand, being firm in your faith." God's Word shows us clearly that the way to withstand Satan is by faith. There is no other way to withstand him. What should our faith rest on? How should we exercise our faith to withstand him? Let us consider what the Word of God says concerning this.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Believing That the Lord's Manifestation<br />Is to Destroy the Works of the Devil</h2><p>First, we must believe that the Lord was manifested for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). The Son of God has come to the earth; He was manifested. When He was on earth, He destroyed the work of the devil wherever He went. Often Satan's work was not obvious; he hid behind natural phenomena. However, the Lord rebuked him every time. It is clear that He was rebuking Satan when He rebuked Peter's speaking (Matt. 16:22-23), when He rebuked the fever of Peter's mother-in-law (Luke 4:39), and when He rebuked the winds and the waves. Although the devil hid behind many natural phenomena, the Lord Jesus rebuked him. Wherever the Lord went, the power of the devil was shattered. This is why He said, "But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt. 12:28). In other words, wherever the Lord went, Satan was cast out, and the kingdom of God was manifested. Satan could not remain where the Lord was. This is why He said that He was manifested to destroy the works of the devil.</p><p>We should also believe that in manifesting Himself on the earth, the Lord not only destroyed the works of the devil, but also gave authority to His disciples to cast out demons in His name. The Lord said, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy" (Luke 10:19). He gave His name to the church so that His church might continue His work on earth after His ascension. The Lord used His authority on earth to cast out demons. He also gave this authority to the church.</p><p>We must distinguish between what the devil has and what we have. What the devil has is power. What we have is authority. All that Satan has is power. But the Lord Jesus has given us authority, which can overcome all the power of Satan. Power cannot prevail over authority. God has given us authority, and Satan will surely fail.</p><p>Consider an illustration of how authority overcomes power: A traffic light on a road controls traffic. When a policeman turns on the red light, all pedestrians and cars have to stop. No one is allowed to dash through a red light. The pedestrians and cars are much more powerful than the red light in terms of power. However, no pedestrian or driver will dare dash through the red light because of the presence of authority. This is an example of authority prevailing over power.</p><p>Authority prevails over power; this is God's established policy in this universe. No matter how strong Satan's power is, one fact remains sure&mdash;the Lord Jesus has given His name to the church. This name stands for authority. The church can cast out demons in the name of the Lord. We can invoke the Lord's name to deal with Satan's power. Thank God that no matter how great Satan's power is, the Lord's name is immeasurably greater. The authority behind the Lord's name is strong enough to overcome all the power of Satan.</p><p>The disciples went out in the name of the Lord. They were surprised when they returned. They told the Lord, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name" (10:17). The Lord's name spells authority. His giving of His name to us means that He has given His authority to us. The Lord said, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you" (v. 19). Whoever desires to withstand Satan must learn to know the difference between the Lord's authority and Satan's power. No matter how great Satan's power is, the Lord's authority is able to overcome him. We must believe that God has given this authority to the church. The church can cast out demons and withstand the devil in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Believing That the Lord's Death<br />Has Destroyed Satan</h2><p>Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil (Heb. 2:14). The manifestation of the Lord Jesus destroyed the works of the devil, and the death of the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil himself.</p><p>The Lord's death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord's death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation. In Genesis 2:17 God spoke of death: "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." This death is surely a punishment. Satan was delighted at this word. Since man would die if he ate the fruit, Satan tried his best to seduce man to eat it, so that death would reign in man and he could claim the victory. However, the Lord's death constitutes the greatest way of salvation. It is true that God said, "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." This death is punishment. But the Lord has another death. The second death is a way of salvation. Death can punish those who sin. Death can also save and deliver those who are in sin. Satan thought that death could only punish the sinner. He seized upon this fact and reigned through man's death. However, God saves and delivers man from sin through the death of the Lord Jesus. This is the most profound aspect of the gospel.</p><p>The Lord's death on the cross takes away not only our sins but also the whole old creation. Our old man has been crucified with him. Although Satan reigns through death, the more he reigns through death, the worse his lot becomes, because his reign stops at death. Since we are already dead, death can no longer sting us. He has no further reign over us.</p><p>"For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." God said this so that man would not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But man ate it and sinned. What then should be done? The result of sin is death; there is no way to change this. However, there is a way to salvation, a salvation which goes through death. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, the old creation and the old man were both crucified with Him. This means that Satan's authority can only go as far as death. The Scripture says, "Through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil" (Heb. 2:14).</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord. We are those who are already dead. If Satan attacks us, we can say to him, "I am already dead!" He has no authority over us because we are already dead. His authority extends only to the point of death.</p><p>Our crucifixion with Christ is an accomplished fact; it is God's doing. The Bible does not say that our death with the Lord is something that belongs to the future. It is not some experience that we hope to attain one day. The Bible does not tell us to pursue death. It shows us that we are already dead. A person is not dead if he is still pursuing death. However, our death with Christ is a gift from God in the same way that His death for us is a gift. If a man is still pursuing crucifixion, he is standing on fleshly ground, and Satan has full control over those who stand on fleshly ground. We must believe in the Lord's death. We must also believe in our own death. Just as we believed in the Lord's death for us, so also we should believe in our death in Him. Both are acts of faith, and neither has anything to do with human pursuits. As soon as we strive to realize these facts, we expose ourselves to Satan's attack. We have to lay hold of the accomplished facts and declare: "Praise and thank the Lord; I am already dead."</p><p>We must see that, in the eyes of God, our death with Christ is an accomplished fact. Once we see this, Satan can no longer do anything with us. Satan can deal only with those who are not dead. He can rule over only those who are facing death and who are on their way to death. But we are no longer facing death; we have already died. Satan can do nothing about us.</p><p>In order to withstand Satan, we must realize that the Lord's manifestation was a manifestation of authority, and the work of His cross has released all those who are under Satan's hand. Satan no longer has any authority over us anymore. We are above him. We are those who are already dead. Satan's way is terminated by death, and there is nothing more that he can do.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Believing That the Lord's Resurrection<br />Has Put Satan to Shame</h2><p>Third, we must believe that the Lord's resurrection has put Satan to shame. Satan no longer has any way to attack us.</p><p>Colossians 2:12 says, "Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead." This verse speaks of death as well as resurrection. Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and "made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it." Verse 20 says, "If you died with Christ," and 3:1 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ." These verses begin with resurrection and end with resurrection, and the verses in between speak of triumphing in the cross. We stand in the position of resurrection, and we triumph in the cross.</p><p>Why can we do this? The statement we made earlier explains this: The Lord has died, and we also are dead in Him. Satan, who has dominion over the old man, can follow us only as far as the cross. Resurrection is beyond him. Just as Satan had nothing in the Lord Jesus while He was on earth (John 14:30), so also he has nothing in Him in resurrection. Satan has no place at all in the new life. He has no authority at all in the new life and cannot touch our new life!</p><p>When the Lord was hung on the cross, it seemed as if myriads of demons were surrounding it. They thought that they could destroy the Son of God. It was to have been their greatest victory. Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death! Here is the glorious fact: The Lord has come out of death! Therefore, we have the boldness and the confidence to say that the life of God is well able to cast away death!</p><p>What is the resurrection life? The resurrection life is a life that cannot be touched by death. It is a life that transcends death, that is beyond the boundary of death, that comes out of death, and that death cannot hold. Satan's power extends only as far as death. The Lord Jesus proved how great the power of His life is through His resurrection. He dismantled the power of Satan. The Bible calls this power the "the power of His resurrection" (Phil. 3:10). When this resurrection power is expressed through us, everything of Satan is cast down!</p><p>We can withstand Satan because our life is a life of resurrection. This life has nothing to do with Satan. Our life issues from the life of God; it is a life that comes out of death. Satan's power only goes as far as death. Whatever it does to us is limited to this side of death. But our life has come out of death. We have a life which he cannot touch. We are standing on resurrection ground, and we look back in triumph through the cross. Colossians 2 speaks of triumphing in resurrection. It is a chapter on resurrection, not death. We do not triumph in death through resurrection; rather we triumph in resurrection through death.</p><p>In order to withstand Satan, every child of God must declare with a strong faith, "Thank God, I have resurrected! Satan, what can you do? What you can do goes only so far as death. But the life that I have today has nothing to do with you! This life has been tested by you already. What else can you do? You are powerless! This life has transcended over you! Satan, get away from me!"</p><p>We cannot deal with Satan on the ground of hope. We can only stand on the ground of resurrection, the ground of the Lord. This is a very basic principle. Colossians 2:12 tells us that we must believe in "the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead."</p><p>We need to take the same position before Satan as that which we take before God. The Bible tells us to put on the robe of righteousness when we come before God (Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4-5). Our robe of righteousness is Christ. We need to put on Christ to come before God. In the same way, we need to put on Christ to come before Satan. God cannot find our sins when we put on Christ. Likewise, Satan cannot find our sins when we are in Christ. When we take this stand, Satan can no longer attack us. We are perfect before God and perfect also before Satan. What a glorious fact!</p><p>We must not be afraid of Satan. If we are afraid of Satan, he will laugh at us. He will say, "What a fool there is on earth. How can this one be so foolish?" Anyone who is afraid of Satan is foolish, because he has forgotten his position in Christ. We have no reason to fear him. We have transcended over his power. We can stand before him and say, "You cannot touch me! No matter how strong and resourceful you are, you are still one step behind!" On the day of the Lord's resurrection, He led the enemy captive and openly shamed him. Today we are standing on the ground of resurrection, and we triumph through the cross!</p><h2 class="head2">D. Believing That the Ascension of the Lord<br />Is Far above the Power of Satan</h2><p>Fourth, we must believe that the ascension of the Lord has put Him far above the power of Satan. Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church." This means that the Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan.</p><p>Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus." This is our position, the position of a Christian. The Lord Jesus is resurrected; He is seated in the heavenlies far above all the power of Satan. We are raised up together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies, far above all the power of Satan.</p><p>Ephesians 6:11 and 13 say, "Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil...and having done all, to stand." Chapter two shows us that we are seated together with the Lord in the heavenlies. Chapter six shows us that we need to stand firm. Chapter two says that we need to sit, while chapter six says that we need to stand. What does it mean to sit? To sit means to rest. It means that the Lord has overcome and that we can now rest in His victory. This is what it means to depend on the Lord's victory. What does it mean to stand? To stand means that spiritual warfare is not a matter of assault but of defense. To stand does not mean to attack; it means to defend. Because the Lord has overcome completely, we have no need to attack again. The victory of the cross is complete, and there is no further need to attack. Here we see two attitudes: One is to sit, and the other is to stand. To sit is to rest in the Lord's victory, while to stand is to withstand Satan and to stop him from taking away our victory.</p><p>Christian warfare is a matter of warding off defeat; it is not a matter of fighting for victory. We have already overcome. We fight from the position of victory, and we fight to maintain our victory. We are not fighting to win a victory. We fight from victory; victory is something that is in our hands. The warfare spoken of in Ephesians is the warfare of the overcomers. We do not become overcomers through fighting. We need to distinguish between these two things.</p><p>How does Satan tempt us? He causes us to forget our own position and our victory. He blinds our eyes to our own victory. If we give in to his tactics, we will feel that victory is far away and beyond our reach. We must remember that the victory of the Lord is complete. It is so complete that our whole life is included in this victory! Once we believe, we overcome. Satan is defeated and we have overcome in Christ. Satan wants to steal away the victory which we have gained. His work is to taunt us to secretly find out if we still have the faith. If we do not know that victory is already ours, we will fail. But if we know our victory, his work will fail.</p><p>Therefore, we counter the work of Satan with the work of the Lord Jesus. We withstand Satan through the Lord's manifestation, death, resurrection, and ascension. We are standing today upon the accomplished work of the Lord. We do not need to try to overcome in any way when Satan attacks us. Once we have the slightest thought of trying to overcome, we have failed, because our position is wrong. How great is the difference between a person who tries to overcome and one who withstands by knowing that he has already overcome. To withstand the devil means that we withstand him by the victory of Christ.</p><p>This matter indeed needs revelation. We need to see the manifestation of the Lord. We need to see His death, resurrection, and ascension. We need to know all these things.</p><p>As Christians we must learn to withstand the devil. We must say to Satan under all circumstances, "Get away from me!" May God be gracious to us so that we may all have such a faith. May we have faith toward the four things the Lord has accomplished for us, and may we exercise strong faith to withstand Satan and reject his work upon us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">HEAD COVERING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:2-16</h1><p>In this chapter we will cover an important subject&mdash;head covering.</p><p>First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women. It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God's order in His creation.</p><p>This passage does not echo the thought in John 10:30, which says, "I and the Father are one." Rather, it says that God is the Head of Christ. It does not emphasize the relationship between the Father and the Son, but the relationship between God and Christ, between God and His Anointed. It is not a relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the Trinity of the Godhead, but a relationship between God and the One whom He sent to earth and anointed to be the Christ. The matter of head covering is an issue between God and His Anointed.</p><p>Neither does the matter of head covering have anything to do with the relationship between Christ and His church. The fact that Christ is the Head and the church is His Body is unrelated to head covering. The matter of head covering involves a totally different issue. First Corinthians 11:3 says that "Christ is the head of every man." Christ is the Head of individual men. Although there are many men, Christ is the Head of them all. His being the Head does not refer to His headship in the church. His headship in this passage refers to His headship over every man. Hence, the subject here has nothing to do with the relationship between Christ and the church. It has to do with the relationship between Christ and every man. Thus, it does not refer to a relationship among God's children or to a relationship between brothers and sisters. Verse 3 says that "man is the head of the woman." We must be clear about this foundation before we can understand the meaning of head covering.</p><h2 class="head1">I. TWO SYSTEMS OF GOD IN THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>I would like to consider this subject from a much broader perspective. This will help us to understand 1 Corinthians 11. Only those who know God and who are familiar with the Bible will understand this chapter. This chapter can be difficult reading for many people. The first thing we have to know is that God has two systems in this universe: One we call the system of grace, and the other we call the system of government.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The System of Grace</h2><p>The church, our salvation, the brother-sister relationship in the Lord, and our being God's children&mdash;these are all items within the system of God's grace. Everything related to the church, the Holy Spirit, and redemption belongs to the system of grace. The centurion and the Syrophoenician woman both received grace from God. Peter received grace, and so did Mary. Lazarus could be resurrected, and Martha and Mary could serve. In the system of grace, man and woman are placed on equal footing.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The System of Government</h2><p>There is another system in the Bible which we call God's government. This system of government is altogether different from the system of grace. The system of God's government is separate from the system of grace; it is another system altogether. In this system, God operates according to His own pleasure.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Creation of Male and Female</h2><p>In His creation, God created both male and female. This distinction is related to God's government. He first created the man and then the woman. This order was also a matter of God's government. God operates according to His own pleasure. He has an independent will. He ordained that human beings would come out of the woman. Even the Lord Jesus was born of a woman. This was related to God's government. No one can argue with God in this matter.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Man's Food</h2><p>In the garden of Eden, man was given fruit for food. This was God's government. After the flood man was given meat for food. This was God's government as well.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Confounding the Language</h2><p>In the beginning there was only one language for all men. But after man built the tower of Babel to demonstrate the united power of man, God confounded human language at Babel so that men would no longer speak the same language. This was God's government. Later, when God poured out His Spirit at the time of Pentecost, the believers who were present began to speak in tongues. This also was related to God's government.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Scattered as Many Peoples</h2><p>At the time of the tower of Babel, the people on earth were divided into many "peoples." These "peoples" signify races, not nations. This also was a matter of God's government. Later, God chose from so many peoples a unique people&mdash;the nation of Israel, who would belong to Him. This was grace. But the separation of mankind into peoples was a matter of government.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Beginning of Nations</h2><p>After a time these many peoples became many nations. The history of the Bible tells us that the beginning of the nations came after the beginning of peoples. First there were the races and then the nations. Every nation had its own king. This also was something established by God's government and under God's government.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Israel Becoming a Nation</h2><p>At the time of the judges, the Israelites were still a race; they had not yet become a nation. By the time of Samuel, they were still a race among other races, because there was no king over them. One day the people of Israel wanted a king like the other races; they asked to be transferred from the sphere of grace to the sphere of government. They wanted a king like other nations. God warned them by showing them how a king would reign over them (1 Sam. 8:9-18).</p><h2 class="head3">7. Saul Becoming King</h2><p>Later, God chose Saul to be their king. As soon as Saul was chosen, God's system of government was introduced among the people of Israel. This does not mean that God's grace ceased; rather, it means that the Israelites explicitly placed themselves under His government. They could no longer rebel against their anointed at will, because the anointed one had become their king. Even after Saul departed from God in the realm of grace, he remained a king in the realm of God's government. We must identify the two different systems here before we can understand the two different situations Saul was under. In terms of grace Saul had fallen, but in terms of God's government he was still a king. This is why David could not rebel against God's ordained authority.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SYSTEM OF GRACE<br />PERFECTING THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT</h2><p>This situation continued until the time of the Lord Jesus. We see both aspects of God's work being present at the same time. The system of God's grace continued to operate in the world. At the same time, the system of His government also operated. The priests and the prophets belonged to the side of grace; they maintained the system of grace. The kings and the leaders of the Israelites belonged to the side of God's government; they maintained the system of God's government.</p><p>On the one hand, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was the Savior to deliver men from sin. This was His work under the system of grace. On the other hand, God's desire is for the Lord Jesus to establish His authority and heavenly kingdom through the work of the cross, with the result that heaven's reign will be brought to the earth. God is continually working to destroy the power of the devil, to bring in the kingdom of the heavens, and to usher in the new heaven and the new earth. On that day grace and government will unite to become one system. This means that in the new heaven and the new earth, the system of grace and the system of government will join together and become one system. Then both systems will be united in the Lord Jesus. He stands for both aspects of God's work. On the one hand, He works on the basis of the system of grace. On the other hand, He works on the basis of the system of government.</p><p>God's government did not begin with His creation of man; it began when He created the angels. This is clearly revealed in the Bible. When Satan was still the morning star reigning over the world, a system of government was already in place. After man was created, many things, such as marriage, the husband-wife relationship, family relationships, and the parent-child relationship, became things within the system of God's government. These basic institutions were established by God according to His system of government.</p><p>I would like to point something out to the brothers and sisters. Those who are saved in this age must learn the fundamental lesson of not frustrating God's government with His grace. I need to repeat this word in an emphatic way: Do not frustrate God's order in His government with the grace that He dispenses to you. God's intention is that man would respect His government; He has no intention for man to annul His government. If you are oblivious to God's government, you are lawless in the eyes of God; you are totally ignorant of the fact that, in addition to the church, there is also the kingdom. You must see the system of government. The system of grace perfects the system of government. The system of government is not for the system of grace; rather, the system of grace is here to perfect the system of government.</p><p>Many people have a fundamentally wrong concept. They think that they can put aside government with grace. This is foolish. One cannot change God's government with His work in grace. The forgiveness we obtained before God in grace cannot replace His governmental forgiveness. No matter how much forgiveness we have received in grace, it will not replace governmental forgiveness.</p><p>God's government works on a totally different principle! From the very beginning, God has been trying to usher in His governmental system. He will continue this work until the very end. Grace always goes along with government. Because man fought and rebelled against the system of government, the system of grace was brought in. The system of grace brings us to salvation and restoration so that we will obey God's system of government. Grace is given to supplement God's system of government.</p><h2 class="head1">III. LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD'S GOVERNMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Adam Being Cast Out of the Garden of Eden</h2><p>Recall how Adam sinned. After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden. The garden of Eden was committed entirely to them. Eden means happiness, and they lived in this happy garden. But both of them sinned. After they sinned, God gave them a promise that a Savior, the seed of the woman, would come. Though there was the promise of redemption, Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden of Eden. Here we see the grace of the Lord manifested through the promise of redemption. Yet this does not annul God's governmental action of casting them out.</p><p>God not only cast them out of the garden of Eden; He also guarded the garden with cherubim so that Adam and Eve could not go back. This was God's government. God's government and grace are two different things. Grace gave man the promise of a Savior, whereas government drove man out of the garden of Eden. From that day forward, man could no longer return to the garden of Eden. This is quite clear.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Israelites Being Barred<br />from Entering Canaan</h2><p>When the Israelites reached Kadesh-barnea, they refused to enter Canaan. As a result, God barred them from entering the good land. The Israelites regretted this and wanted to go in by themselves. Many of them were killed by the Canaanites in one day. They wept and cried, but God would not let them enter the land (Num. 13&mdash;14). Once they refused to enter, they could no longer enter in. God's government would not allow them to do as they pleased. God has His government.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Moses Not Being Allowed to Enter Canaan</h2><p>Moses struck the rock with his rod two times and did not sanctify Jehovah. As a result, he could not enter into Canaan (Num. 20:7-12). Although God was merciful to him and brought him to the mount of Pisgah, he could not join the people of God in entering Canaan. Although he could see the land of Canaan with God on the mount of Pisgah, he could not enter it (Deut. 34). God's grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God's government forbade him from entering the land.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Sword Not Departing<br />from the Household of David</h2><p>When David sinned, God was gracious and merciful to him and forgave him of his sins. God was so gracious that He even granted David a special fellowship after that incident. But the sword never departed from his household (2 Sam. 12:7-14). This was God's government.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Paul's Separation from Barnabas</h2><p>Barnabas separated from Paul because of Mark (Acts 15:37-39). Mark was a relative of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). He disagreed and disobeyed along the way, but Barnabas still wanted to bring him along. Obviously, this decision was motivated by his kinship relationship. Barnabas then departed from Paul and took Mark to Cyprus (Cyprus being their home). Here we see the influence of a fleshly relationship at work. I admit that Barnabas still might have been used by God in some way after this; he still might have done a good job later. But from that point forward, the Holy Spirit erased his name from the Bible. His name was still in the book of life, but it was no longer in the book of Acts. This is God's government. God's government does not allow anyone to take his own way!</p><p>The system of grace is one thing. The system of government is another. The more humble a person is, the more experienced he will be in the system of God's government. Never think that you can annul God's system of government just because you are under the system of His grace.</p><p>Grace never annuls government. In fact, grace makes a person yield to government. I say this solemnly: Grace gives us the ability to subject ourselves to government. Grace does not make us rebels; it does not help us overturn government. These two systems of God mutually perfect one another. Grace cannot annul government. Only foolish ones will say, "Since I have received grace, I can behave loosely and do things carelessly." This is the work of a foolish man!</p><p>The more a person's eyes are opened to grace, the more he will behave as a proper servant (if he is a servant) or a proper master (if he is a master). Similarly, the more a person's eyes are opened to grace, the more he will know how to be a husband, a parent, a son, and a citizen, and the more he will find himself in subjection to authority. The more a person receives grace from God, the more he will know how to maintain God's government. I have never seen a person who truly knows the grace of God destroy His government.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HEAD COVERING BEING RELATED TO<br />GOD'S GOVERNMENT</h2><p>The matter of head covering is related to God's government. I cannot persuade you to cover your head if you do not know anything about God's government. If you do not know the meaning of God's government, you will not know the significance of head covering! Once you see God's government and see that such a system of divine government is revealed in the Word, you will realize that head covering has much to do with this government.</p><p>First Corinthians 11:2-3 says, "But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you. But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ." This is God's government.</p><p>These verses do not say anything about the relationship between the Father and the Son; that is a relationship in the Godhead. They speak of the relationship between God and Christ. To borrow a modern term, we can say that Christ is God's deputy. In ministry and in God's order and government, God and Christ are separate: God is God and Christ is Christ. Christ was the One sent by God. John 17:3 says, "That they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ." God is God, and the Lord Jesus is the Christ sent by God. This distinction between God and Christ has to do with God's government. Christ was originally equal with God, but He was willing to be the Christ and to be sent. God remains God high above, while Christ was sent to do God's work. This is the first thing related to God's government.</p><p>What is God's goal? His goal is to appoint Christ as the Head so that every man would submit to Him. Christ is the firstfruits among all creation. He was the first One created by God. [Editor's note: This refers to His humanity only.] Therefore, He is the Head of every man, and all men must be subject to Him. This is a basic principle in God's government. Christ is the Head of every man. This is not something in the system of grace but something in the system of God's government. Likewise, for man to be the head of the woman is also something in the system of God's government. In His government God appoints man to be the head, just as He appoints Christ to be the Head and He appoints Himself to be the Head. All these arrangements have to do with God's system as a whole.</p><p>God Himself is the Head. He also appoints Christ to be the Head. Moreover, He appoints man to be the head. These are three great principles in God's government.</p><p>God is the Head of Christ. This has nothing to do with whether God is greater or Christ is greater. It means that God is the Head of Christ in His government. Similarly, Christ is the Head of every man in God's government, and man is the head of the woman in God's government. This is God's appointment and ordination.</p><p>Philippians 2 is very clear concerning this. The Lord Jesus is equal with God in His very essence. But He is the Christ in God's government. Since He is the Christ, God is His Head. In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that He did only what He saw the Father doing (5:19). He did not come to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him (6:38). It is as if He were saying, "I am just the Christ, the One who was sent. I dare not speak by Myself. What I hear, these things I speak. I do nothing from Myself, but what I see, I do" (cf. 8:26, 28). He spoke these words on the ground of God's government. God's ordination is for God to be God, and for Him to be the Christ. As such He must obey God. As far as their intrinsic persons are concerned, God the Son is equal with God the Father; they are of equal stature and deserve the same honor. As such, God the Son does not have to obey God the Father. However, in terms of God's government, Christ did not stand in the position of God the Son, but in the position of the Christ, the One sent by God.</p><p>One day God's government will be known by all. The whole world will know that Christ is the Head. This is God's ordination in His government. Christ will be the Head of every man. But today only the church knows this; the world does not know this. One day the whole world will know that Christ is the Head, the first One of all creation. He is the firstfruits of all creation. All created beings will come under the authority of Christ. In the same principle, only the church knows that God has ordained man to be the head of the woman. Do you see the point? Today only the church knows that Christ is the Head of every man. In the same way, only the church knows that man is the head of the woman.</p><p>We have seen that grace can never overturn God's government. I think the lessons we have learned are becoming clearer and clearer to us. Grace supports God's government; it does not destroy it. No one can be so foolish as to utilize God's grace to go against His government. No one can offend God's government! God's hand continually upholds His government. Today a man cannot overturn his father's authority just because he has believed in the Lord. He cannot overturn his master's authority or the government's authority just because he has believed in the Lord. A man cannot say, "I do not have to pay taxes because I am a Christian. I do not have to pay duties." There is no such thing! The fact that you are a Christian makes it more necessary for you to maintain God's government.</p><p>Today we live in the world to maintain His testimony. The Lord has shown us three kinds of heads: God is the Head, Christ is the Head, and man is the head. This is altogether not an issue between the brothers and the sisters. It is basically a matter of government, not a matter of grace. Grace calls us brothers and sisters, but God has another arrangement which has to do with His government. This is God's will, His unique heart's desire. God ordains that He would be the Head, and that Christ would be the One under Him. He also ordains that Christ would be the Head and that everyone would submit to Christ. Now He further ordains that man would be the head and that the woman should have the sign of submission.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE MEANING OF HEAD COVERING</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:4-5 says, "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved." Let us now find out the meaning of head covering.</p><p>The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God's government; he acknowledges this position. He would never annul God's government just because he has received His grace. He would not even allow such a thought to come into him. He would, on the contrary, acknowledge God's government. Just as Christ accepted God as His Head, so also every man should accept Christ as his Head. In like manner, the woman should accept the man as her representative head. Head covering means that one covers his head as if he had no head.</p><p>Please bear in mind that, in practice, only the woman is required to cover her head. In reality, Christ's head is covered before God, and every man's head is covered before Christ. But in practice God requires only that the woman cover her head before the man. This is a marvelous thing! It expresses a profound principle. The whole matter is not trivial by any means.</p><p>Sometimes I feel that I do not have the liberty to speak to some saints about the matter of head covering because they have no idea about God's government. You must first understand what God's government is before you can understand head covering. Since Christ has His head covered before God, I also have my head covered before Him. I have covered my head; it is no longer exposed. God is now my Head. Actually, God wants every man to cover his head. Christ is our only Head. Our head should not be exposed; it must be removed from sight.</p><p>Here, I will say a word to Christian women: God has ordained the man to be the head of the woman. In this day of ignorance concerning God's authority, God only requires the church to observe this. The matter of head covering now becomes a question of whether or not one is a Christian. In the church God requires every Christian to acknowledge His ordained system of government.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SISTERS</h2><p>For the sisters to cover their heads means that they take the position Christ takes before God and the position every man takes before Christ. God's intention is for women to cover their heads as an expression of His government on earth. He asks only the women to cover their heads. A woman does not cover her head for her own sake but for the sake of representation. There are many things which one does for himself, but there are also many things which one does as a representative of the whole group. A woman covers her head for herself, because she is a woman. She also covers her head as a representative, because she represents every man, and she also represents Christ. A woman represents every man before Christ. She also represents Christ before God. The woman's covering before God is equal to Christ's covering before God. In the same way, the woman's covering before Christ is equal to every man's covering before Christ.</p><p>No one should assume any headship before Christ. Everyone should cover his head and let Christ be the Head. If one does not cover his head, there will be two heads before Christ. When there are two heads, one should be covered. Between God and Christ, one head has to be covered. Likewise, between the man and the woman, one head must be covered. Between Christ and every man, one head must be covered. Without the covering, there will be two heads. There must not be two heads in God's government. If God is the head, Christ cannot be the head. If Christ is the head, man cannot be the head. If man is the head, the woman cannot be the head.</p><p>God is asking the sisters to be representatives. The sisters are responsible for the sign of submission on their head. This expresses God's system of government. In particular, God ordains that the woman should cover her head while praying or prophesying. The reason for this is that she should know God's government when she goes to God. Whether she prophesies before men for God or prays before God for men, whether it be prayer, prophecy, going out for God, or going to God, she must conduct these God-related activities by covering her head. This is for the purpose of expressing God's government.</p><p>Man is not allowed to cover his head. A man disgraces his own head if he covers his head before a woman. Man represents Christ. If a man covers his head, he is, in effect, saying that no man should cover his head before Christ, and that Christ should cover His head before men.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. A SIGN OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY<br />FOR THE SAKE OF THE ANGELS</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:6 says, "For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered." In other words, God is telling the sisters that they should be absolute in everything that they do.</p><p>No one can leave her head uncovered yet at the same time keep her hair. If a woman is not covered, her hair should be cut off or shaved. If you feel that it is shameful to have your hair cut off or shaved, you should cover your head. This is what Paul means. A woman should cut off or shave her hair if she does not want to be covered. If a woman thinks that it is shameful to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered. She must be absolute one way or the other and not do anything halfway.</p><p>Verse 7 says, "For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God's image and glory." A man represents God's image and glory. He should not have his head covered. "But the woman is the glory of the man." This is why a woman should have her head covered. A woman cannot express the headship of the man if she does not cover her head.</p><p>Verses 8 and 9 are quite clear. Both speak of government. This is why I say that a person might as well forget 1 Corinthians 11 if he does not understand the matter of government. Verse 8 says, "For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man." This is God's ordination. Man did not come out of the woman at the time of creation. The woman was made from the rib taken out of the man during creation. The head was Adam, not Eve. Verse 9 says, "For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man." A woman must be submissive even for the sake of creation.</p><p>Verse 10 says, "Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels." The Bible does not say what a woman should use to cover her head. It says only that her head, the part where her hair is, should be covered. The reason for doing this is for the angels.</p><p>I have always considered how wonderful this teaching is. It is for the sake of the angels that the sister's head bears the sign of submission. We all know the history of the angels' fall. Satan became rebellious, but how did he rebel? He exalted himself to be equal with God. Isaiah 14 says he uplifted himself and wanted to ascend to God's height. In other words, he exposed his head before God; he was not subject to God's authority. In Isaiah 14 Satan repeatedly said, "I will." "I will ascend to heaven;...I will exalt my throne...I will sit upon the mount of assembly...I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;/I will be like the Most High" (vv. 13-14). This was Satan's ambition. Here we see the fall of the archangel. Revelation 12 shows us that Satan carried with him a third part of the angels when he was cast down (v. 4). Trying to assume headship without first coming under God's headship was the cause of the fall of the angels!</p><p>Today the woman bears the sign of submission. This is for the angels! Only in the church do we find the sign of submission on the sisters' heads. This sign in effect declares, "Our heads are covered, and we have no head of our own. We do not want to be the head; our head is not exposed. We accept man as the head. We are doing this to testify to the angels that have rebelled that we accept Christ as our Head and we accept God as the Head." This is the meaning of the phrase for the sake of the angels.</p><p>When we have the sign of submission on our head, that is, when we cover our head, we are rendering the best testimony to the fallen angels. This explains why Satan is against head covering. Head covering puts him to shame. We are doing what he did not do before God. What God did not obtain among the angels, He has obtained in the church. Some of the angels did not subject themselves to the authority of God and the authority of Christ. This brought in chaos to the universe. The fallen angels and the fallen Satan pose a greater problem than the fall of man. What God could not obtain from the fallen angels, He has obtained in the church.</p><p>When many sisters in the church stand in the position of a woman and cover their heads, an unspoken and implicit testimony is displayed before the angels in the air. It tells them that God has gained what He is after in the church. Therefore, the woman should have the sign of submission on her head for the sake of the angels.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. NOT GOING TO THE EXTREME</h2><p>However, some may go to the extreme. They may think that since the man is the head, the woman should subject herself to him in everything. This puts the woman in a position of blind submission in everything. This kind of submission is unprofitable. The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something. Paul told us that the matter is not that simple. He continued in 1 Corinthians 11:11 with the word however. Head covering is an outward testimony. We have to do it for the sake of an outward testimony. But what is the reality and the intrinsic significance of this testimony? Verse 11 says, "However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord." Some may ask, "What did Paul mean when he said neither is woman without man, nor man without woman?" Paul explained in verse 12: "For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman."</p><p>In the garden of Eden, the woman came out of the man. But today, after the garden of Eden, man comes out of woman. Every man is born of a woman. In reality neither is woman without man, nor man without woman. Neither man nor woman can say that he or she is anything special. "But all things are out from God" (v. 12). Head covering is merely a sign on the head of submission to authority. In the end all things are out from God. In reality man is born of woman, and woman came out from man. No one can be proud of himself, and no one can despise himself.</p><p>Verse 13 says, "Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?" Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, "After hearing this word and realizing that in God's government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?"</p><p>Verse 14 says, "Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him." Here Paul appealed to the feeling of the church in judging the matter. Pay special attention to the words: "Does not even nature itself teach you." Verse 15 says, "But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering." Women all over the world treasure and take pride in their hair. Hair expresses the glory of a woman; a woman always likes to keep her hair. I have never seen a woman throw her hair into the garbage bin. Hair is a woman's glory; it is precious to her. In other words, God gave the woman her long hair for a covering.</p><p>I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered. Since a woman's long hair is a God-given covering, she should cover it further with a man-made covering. We should read verses 6 and 15 together. Verse 6 says, "For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered." Verse 15 says, "But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering." The thought is quite clear once we put these two verses together. God has covered the woman's head with her hair. This being the case, those women who accept God's authority should use something to cover their hair. If a woman refuses to cover her hair, she should cut off the hair which God has given her. In other words, if you accept God's covering, you must also add your own covering. If you do not accept His covering, you must give up what God has given you in the first place. The Bible does not forbid women from keeping long hair; it only says that long hair is not enough and that one should also add a head covering.</p><p>Today neither of the two commandments of the Bible is being observed. If a sister does not cover her head but instead shaves off her hair, we can say that she is still obeying the Scripture. The trouble is that many women refuse to do either. They neither shave their hair nor cover their heads. Verse 6 says that if a woman does not have her hair covered she must be shaved, and that if she is not shaved she must cover her head. Verse 15 says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves.</p><p>What should the obedient ones do? This verse says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves. Those who know God will always add their part to what God has done. They will always go along with God's way and not contradict it.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. NOT HAVING CONTENTION</h2><p>Verse 16 says, "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God." I think Paul's word is quite strong. Paul knew the Corinthians well. Corinthians can be found not only in Corinth, but also in many places! They can be found in the church where you are!</p><p>Paul said, "But if anyone seems to be contentious." What is the contention about? Verses 1 through 15 speak about head covering. Thus, the contention is about head covering. But Paul said that it is wrong for anyone to be contentious. The matter of head covering is not to be contested.</p><p>Many want to argue that the woman does not need to cover her head! This is the same as saying that God's headship over Christ is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; this is the same as saying that Christ's headship over man is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; and this is the same as saying that man's headship over the woman is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter. But thank God! Being a Christian is a universal matter, not a Corinthian matter. In the same way, God being the Head of Christ and Christ being the Head of every man are universal matters, not Corinthian matters. Likewise, man being the head of the woman is a universal matter, not a matter that just pertains to the Corinthians.</p><p>What did Paul say to those who thought that sisters do not need to cover their head and who opposed his words, his decision, and his commission from the Lord? He said, "We do not have such a custom of being so." We refers to Paul and the apostles. There was no such custom among the apostles. There was no sister who did not cover her head among the apostles. "If anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so." There is no way to argue. If anyone wishes to argue, "neither the churches of God" have such a custom. This means that no one may argue about this.</p><p>Here Paul showed us the custom of the churches of God at that time. According to the custom at the time, all Jews covered their heads when they entered the synagogue. Jewish men and women covered their heads with a head covering called a "tallith" before entering the synagogue. Without such a covering, they could not enter the synagogue at all. The custom of the Greeks (Corinth being a part) was that when men and women entered their temple, both uncovered and exposed their heads. No race or country during Paul's time had the custom of men uncovering their heads and women covering their heads. The Jews at that time covered their heads, while Gentiles uncovered their heads. But for God's children, men should uncover their heads, while women should cover their heads.</p><p>Thus, for man not to cover his head and for woman to cover her head was a commandment uniquely given by God's apostles and a custom unique to the churches of God. This custom was different from either Jewish or Gentile customs. This custom was uniquely found in the church. Because this custom was instituted by the apostles, it was brand new, and it was from God.</p><p>All the apostles believed that the woman should cover her head. Should there be an apostle who did not believe that the woman should cover her head, he would not have been one among the other apostles and would surely have been an outsider. The apostles did not have such a custom among them. If any church tried to contest this, Paul's answer was that the churches of God did not have such a custom. No church had such a custom. There was no such custom among all the local churches the apostles visited. From verse 16 on, Paul did not try to reason concerning this matter. His reasoning ended with verse 15. In verse 16 he no longer was trying to reason. If anyone seemed to be contentious, Paul said, no apostle should agree with such a one. Such a one had nothing to do with the apostles and nothing to do with the church. All the apostles and all the churches believed this, and no one could argue about this.</p><p>This is the reason we ask all the sisters in the church to cover their heads in the meetings when a message is given or when they pray. They must do this because God wants to secure in the church what He could not secure in the world. He wants to gain what He could not gain in the universe. We want Him to gain in the church what He did not gain among the angels. We want Him to gain what He has not gained in the world. The sisters should know this. Verse 3 gives us the clear teaching concerning this. God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman. For this reason, the woman should have her head covered. This is the underlying teaching of this portion of the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">X. THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATION</h2><p>The Bible contains a very important principle&mdash;the principle of representation. I have spoken of this before, and I would like to reiterate it here.</p><p>As Christians we walk according to two different principles. One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God. In the eyes of God we not only live the Christian life individually, but representatively. If I am not deceived, I believe that in the coming judgment we will be judged not only individually but also according to what we do as representatives.</p><h2 class="head2">A. As a Master</h2><p>Suppose we have a master with a few servants in his house. The master is a brother, but he treats his servants unrighteously, unjustly, unmercifully, and unreasonably. He will be judged by God in the future for his unreasonableness, unrighteousness, and meanness. But the matter will not stop here. He will receive another judgment. This brother is responsible not only for his relationship with his servants. In the eyes of God and as a master, he represents the Lord. Whenever we are masters, we represent the Lord as the Master. The way we treat our servants should represent the way the Lord treats His servants. If we treat our servants poorly, we sin as individuals and also as representatives; we have misrepresented the Lord. If I am not deceived, I believe that we will be judged for our own sins and for the sin of misrepresenting the Lord in the coming judgment before God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. As a Servant</h2><p>Suppose I am not a master but a servant. Suppose further that as a servant, I steal, lie, and am slothful in my work. I only pay lip service to my master and deceive him in all kinds of ways. I have sinned, and I will be judged for my sinful conduct. But the judgment will not stop here. On the one hand, I am a servant individually, and on the other hand, I stand as a representative of all the servants who are subject to the Lord in heaven. I could afford to cheat, steal, and be slothful if it were just a matter of my personal service before man. But every time the Bible speaks of a servant, it reminds us that we have another Lord in the heavens. Therefore, we are not only servants individually; we represent all those who are servants on earth. This expresses another relationship.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Example of Moses</h2><p>When Moses was at Meribah in Kadesh, he was angry at the Israelites because they tempted God, and he struck the rock twice. God immediately rebuked Moses. Moses lost his temper, and this was wrong. If this had only been a personal matter or an independent act as a leader of Israel, Moses could have been forgiven. He had lost his temper previously. When he saw the Israelites worshipping the golden calf at the foot of the mountain and then broke the two tablets with God's own writing, he displayed an even greater amount of anger (Exo. 32:19). However, God did not rebuke him. He represented God's wrath when he lost his temper then. He was angry on God's behalf, and his representation was right. But what did God say when Moses lost his temper and struck the rock twice? God said, "You did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" (Num. 20:12). In other words, you have not separated Me from your actions; you have misrepresented Me. The Israelites thought it was God who was angry. Actually, God was not angry.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Individual Standing<br />and Representative Standing</h2><p>Personal sin is one thing, while representative sin is another thing. First Corinthians 11:3 indicates that every sister, that is, every woman (even though such a woman cannot be found outside the church) must realize that she has an individual standing as well as a representative standing. God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman. Therefore, the woman must have her head covered. The woman must realize that she represents others. At the very least she has to realize that she represents herself as an individual.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Individual Head Covering<br />and Representative Head Covering</h2><p>When a sister covers her head in speaking or in prayer, she is proclaiming before God that no one in the world can assume any headship before Christ. She is saying that no head can be exposed before God. No one can be the head before Christ; no one can offer his suggestion or opinion to Christ. Everyone has to cover his head before Christ. He should hide his own suggestions and opinions and say to the Lord, "You are my Head." A sister has to cover her head as an individual, and she has to cover her head in the position of a representative. She stands as a representative in this universe. The sisters are declaring to the world the proper standing that everyone should take before Christ.</p><p>Head covering may appear to be a small thing; yet it is a great testimony!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 2&mdash;3</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE REVELATION OF THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>There are seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. These churches were seven actual churches in Asia Minor at the time John wrote the book of Revelation. At that time there were many churches in Asia Minor, but God chose only seven for prophetic representation. Revelation 1:3 tells us that this book is a prophecy. Therefore, God chose these seven churches as a prophecy to foretell the pathway the church takes on the earth.</p><p>Why must we spend time to study Revelation 2 and 3? A great and profound reason for studying these chapters is that these two chapters reveal the history of the church during the following two thousand years. They also show us what kind of church God condemns and what kind of church He approves. This is why it is imperative to read Revelation 2 and 3. Only through the study of these two chapters can we understand the pathway of the church, the kind of church we should be in, and the kind of person we should be to please the Lord. The subject of Revelation 2 and 3 is the way of the church. In particular, these chapters tell us what the church should do in order to please the Lord. We cannot be good and proper Christians unless we understand Revelation 2 and 3.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The First Church&mdash;Ephesus</h2><p>There are seven churches. The first is Ephesus. The church in Ephesus refers to the period of church history during the end of the first century, when the book of Revelation was written. When John wrote the book of Revelation, the condition of the church was like that of the first church&mdash;Ephesus.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Second Church&mdash;Smyrna</h2><p>The second church is Smyrna. The church in Smyrna is a picture of the condition of the church under ten periods of persecution in the Roman Empire from the second century after John's death to the early part of the fourth century. Smyrna depicts the condition of the church under persecution from the time after the apostles up to the time Constantine accepted Christianity. During this period of time, the church suffered great persecution. The church in Smyrna is a prophetic description of church history during that period of time.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Third Church&mdash;Pergamos</h2><p>The third church is the church in Pergamos. It began with Constantine's acceptance of Christianity as the state religion at the beginning of the fourth century in 313 A.D. The root gamos means "marriage." For example, the English word polygamy comes from the Greek root gamos; it means a marriage that involves more than one wife. Pergamos means "Attention! Now there is a marriage."</p><h2 class="head3">1. The First Three Churches<br />Having Passed Away</h2><p>The first three churches have passed away. The fourth church and those after it still exist. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh are all with us today! The difference between the first three churches and the last four is that each of the first three churches appears only after the previous one has disappeared. Thus, the second church appears after the first one has disappeared, and the third church appears after the second one has disappeared. After the third church we have the fourth. But the fourth does not disappear before the fifth appears; both the fourth and the fifth exist simultaneously. The fifth church comes out of the fourth, yet the fourth one does not disappear. In the same way the sixth church comes out of the fifth, yet both the fourth, fifth, and sixth exist simultaneously. By the time the sixth produces the seventh, all four churches&mdash;the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh&mdash;exist simultaneously.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Last Four Churches Continuing<br />until the Lord's Second Coming</h2><p>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are divided into two groups. The first three have disappeared, but the last four are still with us today. They will continue until the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>With Thyatira, there is the prophecy, "Until I come." Revelation 2:25 says, "Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come." This shows us that the church in Thyatira will continue until the Lord's coming. The church in Sardis will continue until the Lord's coming as well. Revelation 3:3 says, "Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." This tells us that the church in Sardis will continue until the Lord Jesus' second coming. The church in Philadelphia will continue until the Lord's second coming because verse 11 says, "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown." The church in Laodicea is the final church on earth. Verse 21 says, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne." This church is the final one and will naturally remain until the Lord Jesus' second coming. The first three churches did not receive any promise of the Lord's coming, but the last four all received a promise of the Lord's coming. They will surely remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Choosing the Proper Church<br />from the Last Four Churches</h2><p>Today we will consider these four churches carefully before the Lord. This will show us the pathway we should take as children of God. If there are four different kinds of churches on earth today and if all of them continue until the Lord comes again, what kind of attitude should a child of God have in regards to these churches? We must choose carefully from among these four churches. If we choose a church which is not well pleasing to the Lord and which the Lord condemns, we will suffer a great loss before the Lord. This is why we have to spend some time to look at the last four churches.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Fourth Church&mdash;Thyatira</h2><p>The fourth church is Thyatira. After the Caesar of Rome accepted Christianity as the state religion, he promoted Christianity and propped it up with his political power. Prior to this, the Roman Empire exercised its political power to suppress Christianity. Then it began to exercise its political power to support Christianity. Consequently, Christianity was not only married to the world but even exalted above the world. One meaning of the name Thyatira is "a high tower." The church has now become a high tower in the world, one that is seen, respected, and worshipped.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Thyatira Being Roman Catholicism</h2><p>All Bible readers agree that the church in Thyatira signifies the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church is a union of the church with the world. The result is that the church is elevated in the world. One intrinsic problem with this is that a prophetess is produced out of this union. This woman is called Jezebel, who assumes the role of a teacher among God's servants. The church is turned over to her rule and control. The problem of the Roman Catholic Church is the problem described in the fourth parable in Matthew 13, where a woman takes the leaven and hides three measures of meal in it. In the Bible this woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Two Fundamental Sins&mdash;Fornication<br />and the Eating of Sacrifices Offered to Idols</h2><p>What does this woman do? Revelation 2:20 says, "But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices." Jezebel has two chief sins: One is fornication, and the other is eating sacrifices offered to idols. These two are sins that are worthy of excommunication. The Lord rebuked the teachings of Jezebel.</p><p>Verses 21 through 23 say, "And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication. Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works." The church in Thyatira and the teachings of Jezebel have two characteristics: One is fornication, and the other is idol worship. In the Bible fornication means mixture. For a man to be in a mixture means that he is involved in fornication. Here we see that the Roman Catholic Church is mixed up with the world.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Mary in Place of the Goddess of Greece</h2><p>Every religion of the world has its goddess. Buddhism has Kuan Yin, and the Greeks worship Venus. The Romans took this practice from the Greeks and worshipped goddesses. They could not find a goddess in Christianity, so they took the virgin Mary to be their goddess. In name they called her Mary, but in actuality she was treated like the Greek goddess. This is fornication and mixture.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Sun Festival Becoming Christmas</h2><p>Many Romans worshipped the sun and celebrated the birthday of the sun on December 25 every year. December 22 is the shortest day of the year. After December 22, days begin to grow longer and nights become shorter. The sun worshippers regarded December 25 as the birthday of the sun, and they had a great festival. After many of them were converted, they came up with an idea when they saw their unbelieving friends celebrating the festival with great alacrity, while they had no celebration. They claimed that the Lord Jesus was the true sun and that December 25 should be the birthday of the Lord. Consequently, they made this day Christmas Day. The only thing that is Christian about Christmas is the use of Christ's name in its name. In fact, it belongs to the sun religion. Please bear in mind that this is fornication before God; it is a mixture. The worship of the sun is mixed up with Christianity.</p><h2 class="head4">d. The Heathen Temple Becoming the Temple of God</h2><p>The church is the temple of God. In the Old Testament the temple of God was built partly with wood and mostly with stone. In the New Testament age God allowed the temple to be destroyed, not leaving one stone upon another. Where is the temple today? All those who believe in the Lord today are the temple of God. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Yet today the Roman Catholic Church has built tall and imposing buildings. The Greeks were skillful at fine architecture. The Romans continued the Greek tradition and devoted much time to the study of architecture. They were also very good at artistic edifices. They felt that all the gods had their own temple, and Christianity had nothing for the eyes to admire. They forsook the teaching of the apostles and built big and handsome buildings. No other edifices in the world can be compared to the cathedrals of Christianity. Men call these cathedrals the temples of God. The cathedrals in Milan, St. Paul's Cathedral in Rome, and Notre Dame in Paris are all high buildings that men call temples of God. Please bear in mind that this thought is pagan in its source. Men turned the pagan temples into temples of Christianity. They consider these buildings as Christian buildings, but in fact they are pagan edifices. Christianity has committed fornication and has followed after pagan people.</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Priesthood in Judaism Converted<br />to the Priesthood in Catholicism</h2><p>Every child of God in the New Testament is a priest. As long as he is a child, he is a priest. In the eyes of God all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are priests and all of them serve Him. But the Roman Catholic Church, realizing that the priests in Judaism effectively served as an intermediate class of people, divided the Roman Catholic believers into two classes and introduced the Old Testament Judaistic concept of the priesthood into the New Testament church. One class of people puts on priestly gowns and priestly caps. Everything that the Bible describes about the priesthood was applied by the Roman Catholic Church to their priests. Catholic priests dress themselves in the same way that Old Testament priests did. They also add much paraphernalia. They have not only borrowed from Judaism but also have brought many things from the Greek religion and Roman temples into Christianity. They have changed God's ordained way. This is fornication. In the Bible fornication means confusion.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Superstitious Elements from Paganism</h2><p>This is not all. The Roman Catholic Church introduced things such as candles, lampstands, censers, etc., which belong to the Old Testament. Even pagan objects were brought in. This is altogether fornication. Paganism, idolatry, superstition, and Roman mysteries were all Christianized. This is not Christianity but a great confusion!</p><h2 class="head4">g. Full of Idols</h2><p>God rebuked Thyatira not only for its mixture but also for its idolatry. How strange it is that God would rebuke His own church for idolatry! The church was indeed involved with idolatry. In the Old Testament men worshipped the brass serpent. In the Roman Catholic Church men worship the cross of the Lord Jesus. Roman Catholicism claims that it has found the actual cross, and many small crosses have been made from the wood of this cross. Men worship these objects. The Lord Jesus is God, and God has no image. Yet these men made an image of God and worshipped it. They also made images of Mary, Peter, and Mark. Eventually, the whole earth is full of their images! Because of differences in culture, some idols are very sophisticated, while others are crude. Those in advanced civilizations create beautiful images, while those in more backward civilizations have only crude objects. But they are all idols. Their cathedrals are full of idols! When Catholics pray, they do not pray to God in heaven. Rather, they light candles in front of idols and make gestures in the form of crosses before them. They have images of the Father, the Lord Jesus, Mary, Paul, and Peter. They have images of all the suffering saints and the martyrs throughout the ages. Down through the ages, and even today, when prominent individuals in the church die, the Roman Catholic Church canonizes them and makes images of them. These idols are then manufactured and worshipped by all.</p><h2 class="head4">h. Worshipping the Bones of the Martyrs</h2><p>This is not all. Even the bones of many martyrs have become objects of worship. If anyone dug out a leg or a bone of a martyr, the Roman Catholic Church would gather around it and worship it. Unless one is well informed about the religion, he cannot guess how many idols there are in Catholicism. Those who are familiar with Roman Catholicism know that it is literally filled with idols.</p><p>The church in Thyatira signifies the Roman Catholic Church. The church in Thyatira has two fundamental sins. One is fornication, that is, the introduction of heathen things into the church. The other is idolatry, which is to make idols out of many things in the church.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Thyatira Being a Church Condemned by God</h2><p>This church is condemned by God. To those in the Roman Catholic Church the Lord says, "Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues" (Rev. 18:4). God is not pleased with those who remain in Roman Catholicism.</p><p>According to Revelation 2 and 3, Thyatira is the fourth church. This church comes after Pergamos. Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have all passed away. Thyatira appears after them and still remains. It will be with us until the Lord Jesus comes back. It is the fourth church, but it will continue until the Lord Jesus comes again. As believers and as God's children, we must not touch anything that has to do with Catholicism. Never touch these unclean things. You will be affected by them once you touch them. I remember D. M. Panton once said, "The errors in their books are so numerous that one hardly realizes that they are errors at all." It is hard for a person to distinguish right from wrong because so many things are wrong, that is, in item after item one finds nothing but error. This confuses the mind! Hence, we can never go the way of Roman Catholicism!</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Fifth Church&mdash;Sardis</h2><p>The fifth church is Sardis. Sardis is the recovered church or the church that remains. We can say also that this is the church which is left behind. This church comes after Thyatira, but Thyatira does not disappear. Sardis comes after Thyatira, but it does not replace Thyatira.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Having a Name<br />That Is Living but Being Dead</h2><p>The condition of Sardis can be seen from the words, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead. Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God....But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments" (3:1-2, 4). The characteristic of Sardis is that it has a name that is living and yet is dead.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Religious Reformation<br />and Political Reformation</h2><p>Protestantism comes after Roman Catholicism. Sardis signifies all of Protestantism. Though Sardis includes the Reformation, she is not a picture of the Reformation but a picture of the whole of Protestantism.</p><p>At the zenith of its power, Roman Catholicism became an autocratic and evil system. The Reformation took place during a time in which the nations in Europe could no longer tolerate Catholicism's suppression. During the Reformation, however, two kinds of forces were at work: One was of God, while the other was of man.</p><p>In the part that was of God, there was Martin Luther. He stood alone against the priests, the bishops, the pope, and the entire Roman Catholic Church. At that time God gave men an open Bible and revealed to them the truth of justification by faith. Lovers of Christ rose up in all corners and brought in the Reformation. They sacrificed their own lives for the Lord as a seal to the word of their testimony. Although they were persecuted by the Catholic Church, they continued in their faith in the Lord's recovery work. They sacrificed everything to uphold the Reformation. The Holy Spirit moved in a prevailing way and produced many faithful servants. The Bible was opened up and men began to see light; men and women everywhere were enlightened about their salvation. They declared that they would no longer trust in their own work or in the priests for their salvation but would put their trust solely in God. This indeed was a great work of the Holy Spirit!</p><p>While Luther was struggling for the Reformation, many political powers, who were critical of the Roman Catholic Church, tried to take advantage of the Reformation and achieve their own political goals. The Reformation became a political reformation as well as a religious reformation. Part of the reason was that Roman Catholicism was armed with not only religious power but also political power. At that time the Roman Catholic Church ruled over the whole of Europe. The Reformation was originally a religious movement. However, kings, rulers, and politicians of many countries seized this opportunity to free themselves from the tyranny of Rome and to declare their independence from Rome. This is the reason behind the political reformation that took place. Formerly, both church government and civic government were under Rome. Now both church and nations freed themselves from Rome.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Formation of State Churches</h2><p>In the end the Reformation became a united front of the church and the world against Roman Catholicism. Not only was the church against Thyatira, but the political powers were against Thyatira as well. The two seized the opportunity to stage a simultaneous revolt against the Catholic Church. As a result, state churches were formed. In Germany and Sweden there is the Lutheran Church. In England there is the Anglican Church, and in Holland there is the Dutch Reformed Church, etc. All of these are state churches.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Religion Being Mixed Up with Politics</h2><p>In the beginning of the Reformation, many of God's people came out of Catholicism because they wanted to be freed from its fornication and idolatry. But their reformation was fueled by political power. In their ignorance they accepted the help of outside power. By setting up new churches, they repeated the mistake of the Roman Catholic Church. In Catholicism we find a church where politics and religion are married. In setting up their own churches, the Protestants also combined politics with religion.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Church Adopting the State as Its Boundary</h2><p>If the believers who left the Roman Catholic Church had turned back to the New Testament, they would have seen that the church is God's people and that it is a society that does not derive its support from anyone. But their light was not strong enough. Many forces around them tried to take advantage of them. As a result, they formed the so-called state churches. The believers in Germany formed the German state church, and all German citizens became members of this church. In England there was the Anglican Church. Anyone born in England was qualified to be baptized by an Anglican priest. According to the definition of the state church, the boundary of the church is the boundary of the state. Not only are believers included in the church, but all the citizens of the land are qualified to be baptized in the church as well. In name, the state church is living. Actually, it is dead. This is how the state churches came into being.</p><h2 class="head4">c. A Mixture of Believers and Unbelievers</h2><p>Protestantism is characterized by a mixture of the world with the church. Prior to this, the mixture was universal; then it became localized country by country. Originally, the Roman Catholic Church ruled the entire world. Then independent churches sprang up in each country, and every country had its own church. The church became identified with God's people as well as those who were not His people; it became mixed. In name it is living, and yet it is dead! This is the condition of Protestantantism.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Individual Spiritual Giants</h2><p>Of course, this did not stop Protestantism from producing many great men. Many truly great spiritual men who were much used by God were found in Protestantism. This is why the Lord said, "But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy" (3:4). This is the history and characteristic of Protestantantism. On the one hand, it is living and yet dead. On the other hand, it produced many great spiritual men. Yet these men were all individuals; they were not a corporate man. Sardis has "a few names." There are always a few here and a few there. This is the characteristic of Protestantantism.</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Rise of the Independent Churches</h2><p>The history of Protestantantism began with the state churches. Later we see the development of independent churches through the so-called dissenters (those who held different opinions from the state churches). They began to realize that many joined the state churches through their so-called "baptism," not through faith. A man did not become a believer through faith but through baptism. Believers were not produced out of faith but out of baptism. Many people were awakened to this error in the state churches. They believed that a man becomes a child of God only after he believes in Him.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Division through the Truths</h2><p>Some of them began to pay particular attention to certain new truths that they discovered. The state churches had no serious intention of doing anything except maintaining their state organizations; they were not serious about serving the Lord. God began to raise men up, a few here or a group there. They began to discover certain truths and condemn certain practices. They began the so-called independent churches or dissenting churches, churches which held different opinions. They suffered much persecution and opposition. The story of John Bunyan is one example of such persecution. There was also the persecution of the Presbyterians in Scotland. The Puritans set sail for America because of persecution. Among such men were John Wesley, George Whitefield, and their groups. God would raise up a person here or there and show him some special truths. He would stand up to condemn certain practices and dissociate himself from these sins. As a result, some separated themselves from the state churches.</p><h2 class="head4">g. Oneness Based on the Judgment of Sins</h2><p>At the beginning, when these dissenting ones separated themselves from the state churches, they were branded as divisive. Because they held different opinions, they were labeled divisive ones. Actually, they were not the ones who were divisive. The state churches had become too broad; too many categories of people were included. In order for God's children to follow Him, they had no choice but to separate themselves from these state churches.</p><p>We have to see that oneness is not based on tolerating sins but on judging sins. Today the oneness spoken of by some is based on tolerance of a certain sin. A sin is discovered, and one tolerates it and then another tolerates it. All those who tolerate such sins form a oneness based on tolerance. When everyone tolerates a sin, no one has any problem with anyone else. There are many things within the state churches which are not of God. A person may be touched by the Spirit in his conscience to reject such a sin, but others will not reject it. The one who rejects it then bears the name of a divisive one. Actually, the problem is not with the one who has seen something, but with the ones who have not seen anything.</p><p>If all of God's children would rise up to exercise judgment, they would be one. The oneness among God's children should not be based on their oversight. We must first be one with the Lord. If God's children are careless in judging sin, they may have a oneness among themselves, but they have certainly lost their oneness with the Lord.</p><p>The history of Protestantism shows that God is continually raising up men here and there to seek His heart and to exercise judgment on sin. Others may not see what they see, or they may refuse to see. As a result, the ones who see something are branded as divisive through their obedience to God. If every child of God judged sin today and dealt with everything that is not of God, they would be one with one another and one with the Lord. Please bear in mind that the judgment of sin is the real foundation of our oneness.</p><h2 class="head4">h. Blessing in the First Generation,<br />Organization in the Second,<br />and Degradation in the Third</h2><p>Another phenomenon among Protestants is this cycle: A person is raised up during a certain generation. This person receives much grace and blessing from the Lord; much blessing is manifested in his generation. After his generation passes away, the second generation remains somewhat good. But by the end of the second generation, men begin to pay attention to other things. They begin to say, "We have received so much grace from the Lord; we should think of some means to preserve this grace. We should form an organization to carry on and maintain this grace." By the second or third generation, organization comes in. Sometimes organization comes in even by the end of the first generation.</p><p>They believe that God is the Giver of grace, but they do not believe that God is also the Preserver of grace. They believe in God's blessing, but they cannot believe in God's continual blessing. As a result, human creeds, regulations, and ways and means are introduced in an effort to maintain the blessing. When the fountain is closed, the water in the pool dries up sooner or later; the water level no longer rises. By the third generation, the condition becomes quite dead, and everything reverts to the same condition as before, a condition which they originally came out of. Then God has to go to another person or to a few persons who will seek new vision, new blessing, new separation, and new grace. This will bring in another period of revival. This cycle repeats itself: blessing in the first generation, organization in the second generation, and degradation in the third generation.</p><h2 class="head4">i. Swinging between Life and Death</h2><p>At first, some left the state churches. Later, the ones who left were, in turn, left behind by others. Originally, those who left the state churches did so because the state churches were dead. Then those who left became dead themselves and were left behind by others. The entire history of Protestantism is a history of being living in name but dead in reality. It is a history that swings back and forth between life and death. Some became living, and some became dead. Not all are dead, for there are always a few who have not defiled themselves, who are the prominent ones chosen and used by God. These are the giants in Protestantism. They are worthy to walk with the Lord in white. This is the entire history of Protestantantism.</p><p>The church in Thyatira was rebuked. Sardis was rebuked as well. What is the way for the believers to go on?</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Sixth Church&mdash;Philadelphia</h2><p>Next comes the sixth church; it has the name Philadelphia. Phila means "love" and delphia means "the brothers." Phila- delphia means "brotherly love."</p><h2 class="head3">1. Returning to Brotherly Love</h2><p>Among the seven churches, this is the only one which does not receive any rebuke from the Lord. The Roman Catholic Church was rebuked, and so were the Protestant churches. Only Philadelphia is not rebuked. One only finds praise in Philadelphia.</p><p>What are the characteristics of Philadelphia? Revelation 3:8 says, "I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name." This is the characteristic of Philadelphia. The characteristic of Thyatira is the teaching of a woman. The characteristic of Sardis is a union between the church and the world and a constant need for separation; it is a continuous struggle between life and death. But the characteristic of Philadelphia is brotherly love. Here is a return to brotherly love. There is no worldliness here because all are brothers. There is no need to struggle to separate oneself from death. It is a return to the original state of brotherhood. Here we find brotherly love.</p><p>Just as Sardis comes out of Thyatira, Philadelphia comes out of Sardis. The Protestants came out of the Roman Catholic Church, and Philadelphia came out of the Protestants. This was clearly a new move of the Holy Spirit. This new move attracted people from the dead Sardis and put them on the ground of brotherly love. In other words, they stood on the Body ground. They did not recognize any other relationship except the relationship of brothers. They did not recognize any other fellowship except the fellowship of love. This is Philadelphia.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Keeping the Lord's Word</h2><p>Philadelphia had two characteristics: They kept the Lord's word, and they did not deny the Lord's name. Here was a group of people who were led by God to keep His word. God opened up the Word to them, and others were able to understand His Word through them. They had no creed, doctrine, or tradition, only the Word of God. At the time of Philadelphia, we find a group of people returning fully to the Word of the Lord, who did not recognize any other authority, doctrine, or creed.</p><p>A man can understand and even preach a doctrine, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible. He can memorize creeds and proclaim his faith in them, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible. The Lord would have given us creeds long ago if the church needed them. Today men analyze the Bible and condense its teachings into creeds. Creeds are limited, but the Bible is unlimited. Creeds are simple, while the Bible is complicated. A foolish man can understand creeds if he studies them. But a foolish man cannot understand the Bible. Only a certain type of people can understand the Bible. Only under certain conditions can a man understand God's Word. Creeds open a wide door and anyone can go in. But the door to God's Word is not that wide, and only those with life can enter it. The door of the creeds is so wide that a smart mind is all one needs to enter it. But God's Word is not that simple. Unless a man has life and is single before the Lord, he will not see or understand His Word.</p><p>Many people think that God's Word is too narrow. They want to broaden it so that they can bring more people into it. But those in Philadelphia rejected all creeds and doctrines. They turned back to the Word of the Lord. The Lord said, "You...have kept My word." In church history, there was never an age when men understood God's Word more than those in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia God's Word was given its rightful place. In other ages men accepted creeds and traditions. But Philadelphia accepted nothing other than God's Word. It returned to His Word and walked in it. In church history there was never a time when the ministry of the Word was as rich as that which we find in Philadelphia.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Denying the Lord's Name</h2><p>The Lord said, "You...have not denied My name" (v. 8). This is another characteristic of Philadelphia. In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance. Men pay attention to names of saints, such as Peter and other apostles. They pay attention to names they like or to names of doctrines and nations. Many say proudly, "I am a Lutheran," or "I am a Wesleyan." Oh, the names of men! Many claim proudly, "I am a Coptic" (of a place), or "I am an Anglican" (meaning British). These are names of countries. These names have divided God's children into divisions! It is as if the name of Christ were not enough to separate us from the world.</p><p>If someone asks you, "Who are you?" and you answer, "I am a Christian," he will not be satisfied. He will ask again, "What kind of Christian are you?" I remember once when I was in another country, a man asked me, "What are you really?" I said, "I am a Christian." He said, "This is meaningless!"</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Lord's Name Being Enough</h2><p>To the Lord, His name is enough for His children. But we have to wait until Philadelphia before we see men who are satisfied with the Lord's name alone. There is no need to have so many divisive names. His name alone is enough! The Lord takes note that they "have not denied My name." This is what He cares for.</p><p>There was never a time in church history when men loathed other names as much as they did in Philadelphia. When one returns to Philadelphia, all other names are denied! Philadelphia has abolished all other names and has exalted only the name of Christ. Please bear in mind that the Lord cares for this one thing. This one thing is the basis for His praise. This is something pleasing to Him. Do not belittle this and do not be careless about it. The Lord takes the time to point out that they have confessed His name and have not denied His name. He pays attention to this and praises it!</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Question of Overcoming</h2><p>Some brothers have asked, "What have the overcomers in Philadelphia overcome?" Do you see the problem posed by this question? The overcomers in Ephesus overcame forsaking their first love. The overcomers in Smyrna overcame the outward threat of death. The overcomers in Pergamos overcame the bondage and temptations of the world. The overcomers in Thyatira overcame the teaching of the woman. The overcomers in Sardis overcame spiritual death&mdash;the condition of being living in name and dead in reality. The overcomers of Laodicea overcame lukewarmness and vainglory. But what do the overcomers in Philadelphia overcome? The entire epistle to them shows only the Lord's pleasure in what they have done. Of the seven epistles, this is the only one which has the Lord's full approval. What is there to overcome if the Lord is fully pleased? It is a church fully approved and rated as the best; it is altogether according to the Lord's heart's desire. But the Lord has a promise for the overcomers in the church in Philadelphia. What do they have to overcome? There is nothing to overcome because there is no problem with this church.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Holding Fast What You Have</h2><p>But the Lord has a warning here. Verse 11 says, "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown." This is the only warning in the entire epistle. Those in Philadelphia are reminded to hold fast what they have. In other words, they have what is right, and they should not lose it. They should not be weary of doing the same things for a long time and should not ask for a change. They should not contemplate doing something new after all the years of doing the same things. They have to hold fast what they have and not let it go! This is the only warning for Philadelphia. The Lord has only one charge for Philadelphia&mdash;to hold fast what they have. What they have done is right and is blessed by the Lord; therefore, they should continue in it.</p><p>If Philadelphia does not hold fast what it has, God will raise up others to take away its crown. The crown has already been given to Philadelphia. But others will come and take its crown if it does not hold it fast. This is the only warning to Philadelphia. Philadelphia overcomes by not losing what it has. This is different from the other six churches. We must pay attention to the Lord's Word. There is only one church which meets the Lord's standard&mdash;Philadelphia. Her characteristic is keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name. We must not overlook these two matters.</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Seventh Church&mdash;Laodicea</h2><p>Five of the seven churches were rebuked. One did not receive a rebuke, and one received only praise. The one which received only praise was Philadelphia. Catholicism, Protestantism, and Philadelphia will all remain until the Lord Jesus comes again. The last church, the seventh one, Laodicea, also will continue until the Lord Jesus comes again. Since Sardis came out of Thyatira and Philadelphia came out of Sardis, Laodicea naturally has to come out of Philadelphia. One begets the other.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Laodicea Being the Result of<br />Philadelphia's Degradation</h2><p>This is where the issue lies today. Once Philadelphia fails, it becomes Laodicea. Do not think that Protestantism is Laodicea. It is altogether wrong to think this way. Protestantism is Sardis, not Laodicea. Protestantism can only be Sardis today; it cannot be Laodicea. No Bible reader should be so foolish as to think that Protestantism is Laodicea. No, Protestantism is Sardis. After Philadelphia has fallen, it becomes Laodicea. Sardis came out of Thyatira, and it was one step beyond Thyatira. Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and it was one step beyond Sardis. Laodicea, however, comes out of Philadelphia, but it is one step behind Philadelphia. These four churches will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p><p>Laodicea is a distorted Philadelphia. When brotherly love is gone, Philadelphia immediately turns into the opinions of many. This is the meaning of the word Laodicea. Laodicea was a city whose name came from a Roman prince, Entiochus. He had a wife whose name was Laodios. He took his wife's name, dropped the os and added sea or cea to become Laodisea or Laodicea. Lao in Greek means "many people" and sea or cea means "opinion."</p><p>As soon as Philadelphia becomes degraded, the "brothers" become the "many people," and its "brotherly love" becomes "the opinions of the many." Love has degenerated into opinion. Brotherly love is something living, but the opinion of many people is something dead. When brotherly love is lost, the Body relationship is lost. The fellowship of life is cut off as well, leaving only the opinion of men. The opinion of the Lord is lost, and the only things left are the vote of the majority, ballots, and the show of hands. Once Philadelphia falls, it becomes Laodicea.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Lukewarmness and Spiritual Pride</h2><p>Revelation 3:15 says, "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot." This is the characteristic of Laodicea. Verse 17 says, "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." These are the characteristics of Laodicea. In the eyes of the Lord, the characteristics of Laodicea are lukewarmness and spiritual pride. It is bad enough for it to say, "I am wealthy," but it continues, saying, "and have become rich." The two statements are evil enough, yet it goes on to say that it has "need of nothing." In the eyes of the Lord it is "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." Where does spiritual pride come from? It comes from history. Some were once rich and they think that they are still rich. The Lord was once merciful to them, and they remember their history. But now they have lost that reality.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Life That Was Present Being Lost Today</h2><p>There is hardly any person in Protestantism today who boasts of his own spiritual riches. I have met many Protestant leaders overseas as well as Protestant pastors in China. They all say, "We are poor! We are poor!" It is hard to find a proud person in Sardis. There is only one group of proud people&mdash;those who were Philadelphia and who had once kept God's word and not denied His name. Yet the life which they once had is lost. They still remember their history, but they have lost their former life! They remember that they were once wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing. But they are now poor and blind! There is only one group of people who can boast of their riches&mdash;fallen Philadelphia, the Philadelphia which has lost its power and life.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Learning to Humble Ourselves before God</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God. Sometimes I hear some brothers say, "God's blessing is with us." God's blessing is with us, but we must be careful when we say this. As soon as we are not careful, we have the flavor of Laodicea: "We are wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing." Let me say that the day we take this position, we have become Laodicea.</p><p>Please bear in mind that we have nothing that we have not received. Those around us may be full of death, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are full of life. Those around us may be poor, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are rich. Those who live before the Lord will not be conscious of their own riches. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may learn to live before Him. May we be rich and yet not know that we are rich. It was better for Moses not to know that his face was shining, even though it did shine! Once a person knows himself, he becomes Laodicea, and the result is lukewarmness. Laodicea means to know everything, but in reality to be fervent about nothing. In name it has everything, but it cannot sacrifice its life for anything. It remembers its former glory but forgets its present condition before God. Formerly, it was Philadelphia; today it is Laodicea.</p><h2 class="head1">II. CHOOSING FOR OURSELVES<br />THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Today I present these four churches to us all. The last three came out of Roman Catholicism, and all four will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again. Today every child of God has to choose the pathway he should take with regard to the church. Do you want to be a Roman Catholic? Do you want to be a Protestant? Do you want to follow the oneness of Roman Catholicism? Do you want to follow the many denominations of Protestantism? Or do you want to take the way of Philadelphia? Or were you once Philadelphia but are now living in the shadow of history and boasting of your former glory, thus becoming Laodicean? When a person becomes proud, forsakes the way of life, and neglects reality, while reminiscing on his history and his own riches, the only thing left will be the opinions of many. Among such ones there can only be discussion and consensus. It appears to be a democratic society but bears no resemblance to the Body relationship. If you do not know the binding, authority, and life of the Body, you do not know brotherly love.</p><p>These four churches will remain with us. We must be faithful to continue in Philadelphia. Do not be curious about Roman Catholicism. Those who are curious will always suffer loss. Do not touch the denominations in Protestantantism. This is not God's way. The Bible shows us clearly that the Protestant movement as a whole had God's blessing, but that there are also many things which the Lord condemns and rebukes. We do not need to delve into these things or ask about them.</p><p>We must learn to stand on the ground of Philadelphia. Always keep the Lord's word and never deny His name. Hold fast the brotherly stand and never be proud! Do not be proud in the face of Catholicism, Protestantism, or the denominations. Once you are proud, you become Laodicea and are no longer Philadelphia! As soon as you show your pride before them, you are no longer Philadelphia but Laodicea. Which way do you want to take? May God bless His children and may the brothers take the upright path with regard to the church.</p><p>The God-ordained pathway for the church is the way of Philadelphia. I may not have tens of thousands of cases to prove that the best of God's children speak the same thing and take this same way. But I have hundreds of cases to prove what I am saying. Once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we need not nit-pick the minor issues. Similarly, once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, we do not have to be so concerned about its minor issues. The Roman Catholic Church has twenty-one different organizations in China. There is no need to involve ourselves with the Catholic Church, and there is no need to learn about the organizations of its different daughters. Once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, these twenty-one organizations are no longer a problem. Likewise, once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we do not need to deal with all of its fifteen hundred denominations one by one.</p><p>The Lord's way is unique. It is the way of Philadelphia. Walk on this way, but be careful not to be proud. Once we take the way of Philadelphia, the greatest temptation is to become proud and say, "We are better than you are. Our truths are clearer than yours, and we understand them better than you do! We have only the Lord's name and we are different!" Once we become proud, we fall into Laodicea. Those who follow the Lord have no pride. The Lord will spew the proud ones out of His mouth. May the Lord be merciful to us! This is a warning to all of us: We must not be proud in our speaking! A person must live before the Lord continually before he can refrain from proud words. Only those who live before God continually will not consider themselves rich. Only they will not be proud!</p><h2 class="head1">APPENDIX: THE HERESY OF CONFUSION</h2><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:31-33; Rev. 17&mdash;18</h1><p>In this appendix to the section on Thyatira, we bring up a subject which we call the heresy of confusion. Every reader of prophesy knows that Roman Catholicism will become more and more powerful, while Protestantism will become weaker and weaker. Revelation 17 says that the great harlot, which typifies Roman Catholicism, will ride on the beast and then be killed by it. Therefore, all genuine children of God must fully prepare themselves for this crisis in the last days. We do not know when Roman Catholicism will become a problem to us. It may be five, ten, or twenty years from now. Perhaps we will still be here; perhaps we will have passed away. We must be clear about this heresy and educate the brothers and sisters. It will be too late to deal with it when it becomes a problem to us. We who are the watchmen of the church must pay attention to this matter and deal with it before it becomes a problem.</p><h2 class="head2">A. A Mustard Seed Growing into a Big Tree</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Seven Parables on the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The Lord Jesus spoke seven parables in Matthew 13. These seven parables show the history of the kingdom of the heavens on earth. They reveal the different stages that the kingdom of the heavens passes through on earth, beginning from the time when the Lord Jesus sowed the seed until His coming again. These seven parables cover the entire period from the time of His first coming, the time when the Son of Man came to the earth to sow the seed, up to His second coming, when He will come to judge and to gather the wheat into the barn. Many things happen between these two comings. The Lord uses these seven parables to explain them and to prophesy concerning them.</p><p>Two of these parables tell us that the kingdom of the heavens on earth will be corrupted. In Matthew 13:31-32 the first parable says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed: "Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches." We have to pay particular attention to the phrase the kingdom of the heavens is like. This phrase refers to the entire parable, not to the words immediately following the phrase. In verse 33 the second parable says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened." This whole verse describes what "the kingdom of the heavens is like." In other words, the phrase the kingdom of the heavens is like does not refer to the words immediately after the phrase, but to the entire parable.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Kingdom of the Heavens<br />Being like a Mustard Seed</h2><h2 class="head4">a. The Word of God Being Sown in the World</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed." The mustard seed is His word, just as the seed in the previous section is His word. It is something that comes absolutely from God. The life of this seed and everything about this seed are of God. Concerning the seed verse 31 says, "Which a man took and sowed in his field." The preceding verses indicate that the field is the world. They also show us that the man is the Lord Himself. This means that the Lord sows the word of God into the world.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Expecting the Seed to Grow as an Herb</h2><p>According to God's intention, this seed "is smaller than all the seeds" (v. 32). The mustard seed is very small; it is smaller than all the seeds. When God sowed His word into the world, His intention was for such a mustard seed to remain an herb when it grew up. God's ordained law from the beginning of His creation is for the mustard seed to grow according to its kind&mdash;into an herb. Everything must grow after its kind. It is right for the tiny mustard seed to grow into a mustard herb. This is God's original intention. God sent His own Son into the world to sow His word into the world. The result is the church which grows out of this earth. God expects the church on earth to be full of life, to bring forth fruit, and to be good for food. It must remain an herb, something temporal, small, unnoticed, and not big enough to shelter others.</p><p>God's intention is to sow, grow, and reap again and again. It is like a wheat crop, which is sown and harvested over and over again. Once the seed grows into a herb, it is taken away, and the ground is cleared for the next sowing. The ground must be cleared for others to come in to believe, to be begotten, to grow, and to be reaped. Others have to believe, grow, and be harvested by God. On the one hand, the church is always continuing on the earth. On the other hand, God's intention is to reap men group by group unto Himself. The church can be food to men, and it can feed men, but it must be reaped bundle by bundle, again and again, like crops of herbs.</p><p>Herbs are not meant for display; they are not supposed to be great. They are meant to be food for man. After man sinned in Genesis, God first gave him herbs for food. God gave herbs to man for food. The herb is not a flower, which is good for show, and it is not a tree, which is great in size. As an herb, it should remain weak, powerless, and fragile in the eyes of man.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Growing into a Tree</h2><p>However, the Lord prophesied that something unexpected would happen. When the Lord planted the mustard seed in the field, it was the smallest of all the seeds, "but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree" (v. 32). The Lord had no intention that the church would become a tree and be rooted deeply in the earth. Now it is no longer growing and being reaped in bundles. Instead, it has become something lasting and remaining, something tall, big, and wide. It draws attention, respect, and visibility, and has become a shelter to others.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Beginning of Roman Catholicism</h2><p>The God-ordained way for the church is one that is according to the footsteps of Jesus of Nazareth, the One who was hidden, lonely, and humble. The church should follow the footsteps of our Lord who walked on this earth in lowliness and humility. At the beginning of its earthly history, the church was persecuted and suffered much opposition. But one day it became rooted in the earth and began to grow. The Roman Caesars who ruled over the world, who controlled the destiny of the nations, suddenly became the church's partners and brothers. Christianity became a religion of kings, rulers, and commanders. The herb became a tree. It achieved a certain status in the eyes of the world. It became big. This was the beginning of Roman Catholicism.</p><h2 class="head3">1. A Unified Church</h2><p>The church in the New Testament is local in nature. It is scattered in every locality and is not united or organized in any way. Although there were centers for the work, the churches were never united into unified organizations. But with the passing of the apostles, the churches began gradually to unify themselves on the earth. Churches in big cities organized the churches in the smaller cities around them, and spontaneously the churches in the bigger cities took over the leadership.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The System of Bishops</h2><p>At first, the bishops, or overseers, were the elders, and they were always plural in number. Later, a bishop from among the elders was appointed. Still later, the bishops began to oversee not only the church in their own locality but churches in several localities. The elders, however, continued to oversee one local church. As a result, the elders and the overseers became two separate classes! Originally, the overseers and the elders were one and the same group of people, but later, an elder was chosen from among all the elders to be a bishop. One elder bore the title of bishop, while the rest remained as elders but were no longer called overseers. The bishop was considered to be an elder of the elders; he presided over the other elders and ruled over the church in that locality. Still later, these bishops expanded their authority and began to cover other localities. Gradually, the condition of the church changed. The bishop of the capital of a province would rule over that entire province, and the bishop of the capital of a nation would rule over the churches of the entire nation. The bishop of Rome naturally ruled over all the churches in the entire Roman Empire. As a result, the church became something very big!</p><p>Originally, the church was a mustard seed, something very small. But then she became a big tree. Now we find something strange on the earth&mdash;united churches. These are institutions organized by men. The Bible shows us that God's intended union of earthly churches is a union of the Body. The fellowship of the churches on earth is the fellowship of the Body. But what do we see today? Men have cast aside this spiritual fellowship and spiritual union. The fellowship of the Body is spiritual, and the union of the Body is spiritual. Today, however, men replace this spiritual union with organizational unions. Beginning from the second century, the church gradually degenerated into a confederation of churches.</p><p>When Constantine accepted Christianity, he saw a church which by then had already become the Roman Catholic Church, a church welcomed by men. That church had become full grown; it was a tree. It was no longer made up of individual churches. It had become a united tree. When the Roman Empire accepted Christianity, many birds came and nested in its branches!</p><h2 class="head3">3. Satan Bringing Defilement into the Church</h2><p>The birds in the second parable signify the principalities in the air. In the first parable, the Lord Jesus said that the seeds were snatched away by birds, and then He explained that it was the evil one who came to snatch away the seeds that were sown. Birds in this chapter refer to Satan and his evil principalities. This means that Satan is responsible for bringing many defiled things into the church.</p><p>Now the church has become a mammoth organization. However, this greatness is a false greatness; it is a deformed greatness. Originally, the church was despised by men. Now she has become a political asset in the hands of ambitious people. The church is full of people, and in politics the more people there are, the more it is an asset. Now every kind of defiled thing has crept into the church. The birds of heaven came and nested in its branches. The condition is like that of Pergamos&mdash;the church has become united with and married to the world. Today the church has become a big and worldly organization, and all kinds of people have come into it.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Body of Christ Becoming Large</h2><p>This tree includes the genuine church, but it also includes many things that should not be there. The seed is still a mustard seed. The trouble with it is that it has grown too big. This excessive greatness is manmade. The seed that was sown by the Lord is still there. On the one hand, the church has deviated. On the other hand, we have to admit that the Lord's church was still hidden within such a church. The only trouble is that something more has been added to it. It is no longer simply the Lord's church, but something greater. The world has crept in everywhere, and the church has become large. The mustard seed has grown into a big tree.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Woman Exercising Her Authority</h2><p>The One who sowed the seed was the Lord Himself. The woman represents the church. In the Bible women always represent the church. The position of the church in the Bible is that of the wife of Christ. Christ loved the church even as a husband loves his wife. Just as God made Eve out of the rib of Adam, Christ produced the church by His life. In the Bible the church is always represented by women. In the future, the church will be the wife of the Lamb. A man, not a woman, sows the seed. In other words, only Christ can sow the seed; the church cannot do this. The church cannot make any decision for herself. It does not have any authority of its own.</p><p>Yet one day the church on earth became like a tree whose roots were deep and whose branches were numerous. The church became worldly and powerful. All sorts of evil powers came into the church and took shelter there. Because Caesar was in the church, the woman became great and assumed much authority.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Woman Beginning to Teach</h2><p>Matthew 13:33 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal." This woman is Roman Catholicism, the degraded church. She began to exercise her self-assumed authority. Many sisters cannot understand why the Bible forbids a woman to teach. This is because the Bible forbids the church to teach. In typology the church has no authority to teach. The principle of forbidding the woman to teach shows us that the church has no authority to teach. Here the woman began to put leaven into the meal. This means that the woman began to exercise her authority. In other words, the church began to teach.</p><p>The Roman Catholic Church tells men that the Bible is God's Word, yet it also says that the church can speak for God. Of course, the church that it refers to is the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has become very powerful and has brought many things into the church. If you argue that the Bible does not say anything about the practices of the church, the Roman Catholic Church will tell you that it decides the way things should be. If you say that there are no idols according to the Bible, it will say that the pope has sanctioned the idols. You may say that there is no such thing as the worship of Mary in the Bible, but it will say that the church believes that Mary should be worshipped. The woman has assumed the role of teacher.</p><p>Thyatira, which in God's eyes is Roman Catholicism, tolerates Jezebel, a prophetess. This woman brought adultery into the church, and she brought idolatry into the church. The symbol of the woman means that the church rather than the Lord is now making all the decisions. It is Jezebel, the prophetess, who is teaching, not the Lord. It would have been better for the church if it had received its teaching from the Head instead of assuming the role of teacher for itself. When the church assumes this role, it results in all kinds of heresies being introduced into the church. This is what the Lord means when He says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Leaven in Three Measures of Meal</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Leaven Being Wrong Doctrines,<br />Which Are Easy to Take</h2><p>Leaven refers to wrong doctrines. The Lord Jesus spoke about the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees. In Mark 8:15 there was the leaven of Herod. Thus, leaven in the Bible refers to wrong doctrines. It is quite clear that the fine flour in Leviticus 2:1 refers to the food of God's people. In particular it refers to the Lord Jesus. The Word of God shows us that the Lord Jesus is the fine flour, which is the food God gave to His people. Leaven is not allowed in this food. God commanded the people of Israel to eat unleavened bread when they came out of Egypt. In other words, putting leaven into fine flour spoils the Lord Jesus as our food! Originally, there was fine flour, but now leaven has been added to it.</p><p>What happens when leaven is added to fine flour? Without leaven, bread is coarse, tasteless, hard, heavy, and difficult to digest. With leaven, bread becomes light and easy to digest. Leaven makes the flour tasty and easy to digest. Many people feel that it is too hard to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings; they find it hard to digest these things. Those who study the types of the Old Testament know clearly that fine flour refers to the life of the Lord Jesus. Some feel that such a life is too weighty, hard, and solid; they cannot take it. The woman in the parable introduces many heresies into the church. She leavens the fine flour, making it easier for many to accept the Lord! When the world and every kind of heresy and doctrine are brought into the church, it is easier for someone to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings! This is what Roman Catholicism has done.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Heresy of Confusion</h2><p>According to the truth concerning the church, the works mentioned above constitute a great mixture. The world is mixed with the church, grace is mixed with the law, and believers are mixed with unbelievers. The result is confusion. Moreover, righteousness is mixed with mercy, paganism with Christianity, and religion with politics. There is no greater confusion and fornication than that which is seen in Roman Catholicism! It mixes Christianity with Judaism and Grecian art with the worship of God. It brings in every conceivable thing from the world! The birds of heaven have come in. Leaven has been put into the meal, and it has become leavened. Now it is light and puffy, and everyone can accept it. A person can be a Catholic as long as he is baptized. If he sins, he can buy an indulgence, which will deliver him from the sins of this life as well as the future purgatory.</p><p>All kinds of heresies have come in! As a result, the meal is now leavened, and men can easily accept it. Roman Catholicism does not ask men to take the leaven; it only asks men to take the fine flour which contains the leaven. Roman Catholicism gives us heresies as well as truths. It believes that Christ is the Son of God and that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption. These two basic tenets of faith are there, but the fine flour has been leavened.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Three Measures Being a Convenient Unit</h2><p>Why does the Bible say three measures here? The number three is frequently used in the Bible. Abraham took three measures of meal and made bread for the angels. It seems that three measures can be easily held in our hands. This is a common measure, a common unit. It is like measuring flour or rice by packets or sacks. In the ancient days the most convenient unit was three measures.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Confusing the Word of God</h2><p>The problem is that the woman has sown confusion into the food of God's people! She has destroyed their food! She has brought all sorts of heresies into the church. By introducing the heresies into the church, Catholicism has confused the Word of God.</p><p>This work of the Roman Catholic Church results in the world creeping into the church. The woman now assumes great authority. She has taken control of worldly affairs as well as spiritual affairs. She has not only established a large church on earth, but has even extended her dominion over the nations of the earth. In other words, the church has taken over political power as well as religious power. It has indeed become a big tree. At the same time, it has truly mingled leaven with the fine flour.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Whole Being Leavened</h2><p>The word of the Lord here is quite serious. The second part of Matthew 13:33 says, "Until the whole was leavened." Please bear in mind that today, the lump of meal is not yet fully leavened. All orthodox students of prophecy agree that the power of Roman Catholicism has not diminished. The Lord says that this will go on until the whole is leavened. Today, Roman Catholicism has been leavened to quite a serious extent. It has been leavening for over a thousand years! But we cannot say that the lump is fully leavened yet. The Lord says that one day the whole will be leavened. The power of Catholicism will continue to expand. It will not stop until its end comes, when it is fully consumed by fire. The word of the Lord is quite serious here: "Until the whole was leavened." Here the Lord tells us that the power of Roman Catholicism will continue to expand.</p><p>How great has the Roman Catholic Church become! How numerous are the heresies found in it! The leaven has gained more and more ground. The Lord's supper has become the Mass, and the bread has become the flesh of Christ. Transubstantiation, the doctrine of turning the bread into the actual flesh of Christ as soon as one touches it, has prevailed. There are incense, crucifixes, and rituals. People put their trust in various organizations and names. The Catholic Church is more tightly controlled than any country or state in this world. There are all kinds of organizations within it, and one could not understand all of them even if he spent several years to study them. On the one hand, it has confused the doctrine of Christ. On the other hand, the tree has become very large.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Pope Becoming the Universal Overseer</h2><p>Here I will quote some words from some of the popes. The popes call themselves universal overseers. Originally, an overseer was an elder of a local church, and the elders of the local churches were called overseers. Eventually, one of the overseers became a bishop and ruled over other elders of the church. Still later, the bishops began to take control over other churches, and then eventually, over the whole world. Thus, the pope called himself the universal overseer. One of the popes said, "I, the Pope, am the king of kings, and my laws precede all laws." This was the written declaration of a pope concerning his papal authority. Does this declaration sound like something that should come out of the mouth of one who follows the lowly Jesus of Nazareth? Not at all.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Infallibility of the Pope</h2><p>In the Vatican Conference in 1870, a decree read, "The Pope of Rome cannot change or improve on his own words." Imagine how great the authority of Roman Catholicism has become! Anything can be improved upon except the words of the pope of Rome! His words are the supreme command and cannot be improved upon. What kind of spirit is behind these words? Clearly, man's authority has usurped God's authority! The above statement applies to all proclamations by any pope. We can find numerous claims similar to this one.</p><p>One pope in Rome published a message called "The Scheme." At first, Roman Catholicism believed that only the church was infallible. But this message extended this claim by telling everyone that not only was the church infallible, but the pope was infallible as well. The pope could not be wrong in himself. The Chinese expression bu-neng-tzo-wu for infallible may not sound that strong in Chinese, but in Greek, Latin, and English infallible is a very strong word. Only God is infallible, but Catholics say that the pope is infallible as well. This is heresy and leaven.</p><h2 class="head3">6. How God Sees Catholicism</h2><p>What is God's attitude toward Catholicism? Revelation 17 speaks of a great harlot. She is not just an adulteress but a harlot. To commit a moral sin after one is married is adultery, but to commit a moral sin without a marriage at all is harlotry. Here the Bible calls Roman Catholicism a harlot.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Rome Being a Great Harlot</h2><p>Revelation 17:18 says, "The woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth." Verse 9 says, "Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are the seven mountains where the woman sits." Who is this woman? God shows us through John that this woman is the great city which rules over the kings of the earth. This city is built upon seven hills. The woman is sitting upon these hills. There is only one city in the whole world which bears the name The City of Seven Hills&mdash;Rome. Often great cities of the earth have more than one name. For example, Canton is also known as "Sui," and Shanghai is known as "Hu." The city of Rome has another name&mdash;The City of Seven Hills. Throughout the ages, there have always been many sporting competitions in the city of Rome. The medals won by the champions, be they silver or gold, were all engraved with seven hills in the background. The coins which Caesar issued had the same engravings. They had the image of Caesar on one side and seven hills on the other side. Keep in mind that The City of Seven Hills is another name for the city of Rome. Revelation 17 shows us that this woman sits on seven hills. She is the great city which rules over the kings of the earth and which is built upon seven hills. This shows us clearly that this woman is Rome.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Religious Rome and the Political Rome</h2><p>It is clear that this woman is Rome. But the question is which Rome is she. Is she the political Rome or the religious Rome? There are two different Romes. Is this woman the Rome of Catholicism or the imperial Rome? We will find the answer to this after we consider the following explanations.</p><p>Revelation 17:3-4 says, "He carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication."</p><p>Here are two things before us: One is a woman and the other is a beast. The woman is sitting upon the beast with seven heads and ten horns. The seven heads upon the beast are seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings. The seven kings are the great kings, while the ten kings are the small kings. The two kinds of kings are different in the Greek text. One is a big king, while the other is a small king. Most Bible readers know that the beast is the Rome of the Roman Empire. If the beast is the imperial Rome, which includes seven kings and ten kings, the woman has to be the religious Rome. There are only two Romes&mdash;imperial Rome and religious Rome. One is the political Rome, whereas the other is the ecclesiastical Rome. The woman is sitting upon the beast, which means that the church is sitting upon the Empire. If the beast is the Roman Empire, clearly the woman is the religious Rome.</p><p>While the Spirit of God shows us Rome's past, how is she today and how will she be in the future? God's Word provides a clear answer to these questions.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Purple and Scarlet</h2><p>Revelation 17:4 says, "The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet." Purple is the color of royalty. The pope has always claimed to be the king. At the same time, everyone who has ever visited Rome knows that scarlet is the color of Rome. What are the cardinals called? In Chinese they are known as the "Scarlet Robe" cardinals. Their robes, inner garments, and even socks, are all scarlet in color. The pope's carriage is scarlet as well. Three-quarters of his guards are dressed in scarlet. His carpets are scarlet. Wherever the pope travels, scarlet carpet is rolled out along the way. Rome is full of scarlet. On the one hand, the clothing is in purple. On the other hand, no other country has as much scarlet as Rome.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Gilded with Gold, Precious Stone, and Pearls</h2><p>"Gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls." It is hard to find another place on earth that has as much gold and as many precious stones and pearls. The cathedrals in Rome, the idols in the cathedrals, and all the adornments and crowns of the pope are made of gold, precious stone, and pearls. For example, the pope has a diamond, the Kruger Diamond, which is worth 833,000 British pounds.</p><h2 class="head5">1) The Pope Having Two Crowns</h2><p>The pope must wear two crowns at his coronation, one signifying that he is the king of the church and the other signifying that he is the king of the world. One crown, the Miter, signifies the pope as the king of the church. When the pope receives the Miter, he claims headship over the church. Following that, another crown, the Tiara, is given to him. The Tiara is a crown with seven layers and is made of pure gold. This signifies that he is king of the whole earth. The Lord Jesus has not established His kingdom on earth yet. But here are men who have claimed the kingship for more than a thousand years. The kingdom is not here yet, but some have already assumed the kingship. The Tiara is embedded with 146 precious stones and 540 pearls. All of them are big and costly.</p><h2 class="head5">2) St. Peter's Cathedral and the Vatican</h2><p>St. Peter's Cathedral, where the pope frequently appears, was built at a cost of nine hundred million pounds. This building was supposedly erected in remembrance of Peter, a fisherman by the sea of Galilee.</p><p>I have visited the Vatican. It is hard to estimate how much that city is worth, because everything there is precious. The entire ceiling of St. Peter's Cathedral is painted with eighteen- karat gold. Everywhere the city is shining with gold. The buildings in the pope's residence cause any palace of any king or emperor on earth to pale in comparison! One can hardly find another place that exceeds Rome in luxury and excess. Yet the pope claims to be the earthly representative of Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p>Thus, every word of the Bible is fulfilled!</p><h2 class="head4">e. Full of Abominations</h2><p>"Gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations." In the Bible the word abominations always refers to idols. For example, abominations in 2 Chronicles 33, Ezekiel 20, Daniel 9, and Deuteronomy 7 refer to idols. Abominations in the Bible only mean one thing&mdash;idols.</p><h2 class="head4">f. The Unclean Things of Fornication</h2><p>"Cup full of...the unclean things of her fornication." This means that the things of other religions have been brought into Christianity. This is indeed a defilement.</p><h2 class="head4">g. Its Power Extending to All Nations</h2><p>"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication" (v. 2). The power of Roman Catholicism is truly international in nature!</p><h2 class="head4">h. Everything Being a Confusion</h2><p>Those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. Men have been converted to Roman Catholicism everywhere. She is indeed Babylon. Babylon means confusion and fornication, and that is exactly what she is! I have said that she has mixed the world with the church, paganism with Christianity, believers with unbelievers, grace with the law, the New Testament with the Old Testament, and God with idols. Everything is a mixture and everywhere there is fornication. This is what Roman Catholicism has done.</p><h2 class="head3">7. Being Drunk with the Blood of the Saints</h2><p>Revelation 17:6 says, "I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." She was drunk with the blood of the saints! All readers of the Bible know that the persecution of the Roman Empire ended in 313 A.D. But the persecution of the Roman Catholic Church has never stopped. It is going on even today (1948). We do not have to read many books to find this out. Foxe's Book of Martyrs tells us about men killed by the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire. As a matter of fact, the number of people who have been killed by the Catholic Church far exceeds the number of those who have been killed by the Roman Empire.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Persecutions in Spain</h2><p>Every student of history knows about the persecutions in Spain, the Spanish Inquisition. Believers were branded as heretics and 10,220 were burned to death within twelve months. As soon as a person confessed his faith in the Lord, he was put to death. All the judges in Catholic countries obeyed the order of the church. It was rare for the church to execute men directly. When the church wanted someone to die, it would request the courts to execute them. The church would not kill directly, but it asked the local authorities to do the killing.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Twenty-seven Anathemas of the Pope</h2><p>The pope would pronounce twenty-seven anathemas every Thursday against all those who were considered heretics. Of course, when one adds up the finer points of the anathemas, there were more than twenty-seven items. The pope would curse all those who believed in the so-called heresies. After his pronouncement, he would kindle a torch and cast it down and quench it, signifying that everyone who believed in heresies would suffer eternal perdition. Please bear in mind that the heresies the Roman Catholic Church spoke of are what you and I believe in.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Sworn to Persecute the Believers</h2><p>Since the time of Martin Luther, all bishops of the Roman Catholic Church had to make a solemn vow to persecute the heretics. In other words, the Roman Catholic Church is committed to persecuting those who hold the same faith as ours. St. Thomas Aquinas, a renowned figure in Catholicism once said, "Anyone who believes in heresies must be handed over to secular officials to be destroyed after being admonished twice." The Catholic Church would not execute the judgment itself, but it would hand the case over to local officials for execution. The Roman Catholic Church openly professes that the words of Thomas Aquinas are direct inspirations of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Do not think that this persecution is over. No, it is still going on. Everyone who has eyes will see that Roman Catholicism will keep coming back.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Murderous Laws and Decrees</h2><p>Within the stated decrees of Rome there is a clause which says that secular kings must destroy all heretics within their realms or else be excommunicated or lose their thrones.</p><p>A few popes in Rome, such as Holonesis III, Ignas IV, and Alexander III, passed decrees which demanded all Catholics to fully destroy heretics. Gregory XIII told Charles IX that if he wanted to keep his country in godliness and religiosity, he must condemn all the heretics on the whole earth and fully destroy them. One of the pope's words was published in the British newspaper, Times, on July 13, 1895. It said, "If you assassinate a Protestant, it will absolve your sin of assassinating a Roman Catholic." These were the words of a pope! Another pope said, "To murder someone under the order of a priest is not considered murder." These were the laws and edicts of Roman Catholicism.</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Testimony of the Blood of the Saints</h2><h2 class="head5">1) In Madrid</h2><p>As late as 1809 there were still witnesses who saw Protestants, the so-called heretics, killed in Madrid, the capital of Spain. Some had been freshly slain, while others were left to decay. There were some who were half-alive, while others, both men and women, young and old, even men in their seventies, were among the victims. Some had been stripped naked and thrown into prison. The instruments of torture that were employed could only have been conceived of by Satan in collaboration with men. This was the condition in Madrid as late as 1809.</p><h2 class="head5">2) In Rome</h2><p>In 1848, during the Italian revolution, piles of bones were found in large buildings in Rome. Two furnaces were found in these buildings with bones not yet fully burned.</p><p>One way of dealing with the Protestants was this: "Hang a person by the legs with a pulley and tie him with a rope. Tighten the rope with a ratchet so that it cuts into the flesh. Then drop water from the ceiling onto the person's mouth. Cover his mouth so that he may not breathe or ventilate."</p><p>In 1540 the Jesuit Society was formed by the Roman Catholic Church to counteract the Protestants, and from that time more than 1.9 million believers were murdered in Rome alone.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Persecution Still Going on Today</h2><p>In 1901 Pope Leo XIII published an article in Rome which said, "The church, that is, the Roman Catholic Church, has authority from God to confiscate all properties of heretics and imprison and burn them."</p><p>Please bear in mind that Roman Catholicism has been persecuting God's children down through the ages. I have read many such stories. Many martyrs suffered severe persecution in America, Germany, Spain, and other places. The Catholic Church calls everyone who puts his faith in Christ a heretic. It is a heresy to have faith in Christ; it is a crime punishable by death. The Scripture is indeed fulfilled: "I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." This is the persecution of Roman Catholicism. It is still here with us today.</p><h2 class="head3">8. Roman Catholicism Covering the Whole Earth</h2><p>Revelation 17:1 says, "One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters." Verse 15 says, "He said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues." The Bible shows us that this harlot sits upon many waters, which means that Roman Catholicism will expand tremendously. Verse 16 pronounces judgment on Roman Catholicism. Verse 15 shows us that Roman Catholicism will cover the whole earth before she is judged. This is the Lord's prophecy, and we cannot change it! She will sit upon peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. She will spread everywhere and expand greatly.</p><p>Roman Catholicism is prospering not only in China but also throughout the whole world. I have always paid attention to statistics. For every Protestant in America, there are seven Catholics. The Catholics outnumber the Protestants sevenfold. Since 1920, after Mussolini made a pact with the pope by acknowledging the Vatican as an independent state, Roman Catholicism has greatly expanded. In 1913 fourteen countries sent their ambassadors to the Vatican. Five emissaries of Rome were stationed overseas. By 1922 there were twenty-five countries with ambassadors in the Vatican, and Rome had twenty-five emissaries overseas. Today in 1948 there are seventy countries with ambassadors in the Vatican, including China. The power of Roman Catholicism is continually expanding.</p><p>Today the woman is still with us. Someday she will marry Antichrist. This woman is riding on the beast. In verse 3, she rides upon the beast, which means Roman Catholicism will be directing Antichrist. Later Antichrist will destroy the woman; the ten kings will rise up and make her desolate and naked, eating her flesh and burning her utterly with fire (v. 16). This is her end, which will come to pass at the beginning of the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head3">9. God's Commandment to His People</h2><h2 class="head4">a. Come out of Roman Catholicism</h2><p>Please bear in mind that there are saved ones in Roman Catholicism. Do not think that Roman Catholicism is void of saved ones. There are two things which Catholicism still upholds&mdash;Christ as the Son of God and His death for mankind. God is calling us now: "Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins" (Rev. 18:4).</p><h2 class="head4">b. Do Not Be Curious</h2><p>I am telling you these things to show you what will transpire on earth. Sooner or later the power of Roman Catholicism will be greatly expanded! Beware and do not be curious. Do not try to touch it. On the one hand, we should know about it. On the other hand, we should not touch it. This should be our attitude.</p><p>God forbids any of His children to touch the things of Roman Catholicism. He did not say that she is an adulteress but that she is a harlot. A person who sins in marriage is called an adulteress. But those who are not even married do not meet the requirement of being an adulteress; they are harlots. Roman Catholicism has nothing to do with God. Today a woman has stepped in and is teaching the church, putting leaven into the three measures of meal, and riding upon Antichrist, the Roman Empire. God calls this one the great harlot! A new believer must not be fooled. He must not think that since we and Catholics both believe in Jesus, we are therefore the same. We must be very clear that we should in no way communicate with Roman Catholicism. We must shut the door and not go in! Do not be led away by curiosity!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">ONENESS</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE HEAD, THE BODY,<br />AND ALL THE MEMBERS BEING CHRIST</h2><p>In this chapter we will cover the subject of oneness among Christians. We have seen that the Body of Christ is something that can be seen on earth. Paul told the Corinthians, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" (1 Cor. 12:12). Paul did not say, "So also are Christ and His church." Neither did he say, "So also are Christ and His people." Paul said, "So also is the Christ." In other words, the Head is Christ, the Body is Christ, and all the members are Christ. This is why he said that even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. This word shows us clearly that the Head, the Body, and all the members are Christ.</p><p>At the time Paul saw the light on his way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" Saul asked, "Who are You?" The Lord answered, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute" (Acts 9:4-5). The "I" was in heaven. How could Paul, who had letters from the high priest on earth, be persecuting Jesus of Nazareth, who was sitting at the right hand of the Father in heaven? Here we see the oneness of the Body of Christ. The Head, the Body, and all the members are Christ. When Saul persecuted the church on earth, the Lord did not ask, "Why are you persecuting My church?" or "Why are you persecuting My people?" Instead the Lord asked, "Why are you persecuting Me?" By persecuting the church, Paul was persecuting Him. This means that Christ and the church are one.</p><h2 class="head1">II. ONENESS BEING EXPRESSED ON EARTH TODAY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Body of Christ Being on Earth</h2><p>Because this Christ can be persecuted, it is clear that this Christ is on earth. Therefore, the Body of Christ is something which appears on earth. This Body, which 1 Corinthians 12:12 refers to in the phrase so also is the Christ, is on earth. The Body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the Body, being many, are one Body. This Body is on earth, because it can be persecuted. Saul was persecuting the Body on earth, but the Lord said that he was persecuting Him. This means that this Body is on earth.</p><p>This has a crucial bearing on many things. If the Body of Christ is one and Christ has only one Body, the oneness of the Body cannot be something expressed only in heaven or in the future. It has to be something expressed on earth. The Body is one on earth. First Corinthians 12 shows us the Body of Christ. It says, "Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" (v. 26). This shows us clearly that the Body of Christ is something on earth. If the Body were in heaven, it would be reasonable to say that it rejoices, but it would be unreasonable to say that it suffers. It is impossible to say that a member suffers in heaven. If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. This is clearly something that occurs on earth. Only by being on earth can there be the possibility of a member suffering, and only on earth can there be the possibility of the whole Body suffering and being persecuted. Therefore, the oneness of the Body of Christ is not something in heaven in the future but something on earth today.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Oneness Being Expressed in the World Today</h2><p>The Lord Jesus' prayer in John 17:21 is for the church to be one on earth. He said, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me." If we put this phrase even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us within parentheses, it is clear that the Lord is praying for the church to be one so that the world may believe. If the world may believe because of this oneness, then clearly this oneness has to be before the world. The Lord prayed that the world may believe. This shows us that oneness is something to be manifested in the world today.</p><p>First, we must be clear that Christian oneness is something which is manifested on earth and which is in the world today. Christian oneness is not something manifested in heaven in the future. Of course, Christians will be one in heaven in the future. But Christian oneness is expressed and practiced on earth today rather than only in heaven in the future. Everyone must be clear concerning this matter. Some may tell others, "Do not worry whether or not the church is one today, and do not be concerned whether Christians are one. When we reach heaven, we will all be one." These ones are talking about something that will happen when the Lord appears. But what the Lord is after today is a oneness on earth. This responsibility lies with us. We should not wait until we get to heaven to be one. The oneness of Christians should be expressed on earth today. This is the first thing we must be clear about.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE BOUNDARY OF ONENESS<br />NOT BEING GREATER THAN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Oneness of the Church Being Limited<br />by the Boundary of the Body</h2><p>Many people have a certain concept about oneness. They think that as long as a man is a Christian in name, they can be one with him, whether or not he belongs to God, has life, and is a member of the Body. But the oneness which the Bible speaks of is a oneness of the Body. The oneness which many people suggest today has gone beyond the boundary of the Body; it includes corpses and things which are foreign to the Body. God's Word does not approve this kind of oneness.</p><p>Let me say emphatically that only the oneness of the Body can constitute the oneness of the church. The oneness of the church has the Body as its boundary; it cannot extend beyond the Body. Oneness does not mean that we have to be one with whoever bears the resemblance of Christianity or the name of a Christian. God's Word does not sanction this or say anything about it.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Wheat Not Being One with the Tares</h2><p>Many people like to quote Matthew 13. They say that the Lord likens His departure from the world to a man sleeping in the second parable. His enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away. When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, the tares also appeared. The slaves of the master of the house then came and said to the master, "Do you want us then to go and collect them?" (v. 28). The master replied, "Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn" (v. 30). Many people have taken oneness to mean a oneness of wheat and tares. They think that oneness is not merely a oneness of the wheat but of the tares as well. But note that the Lord is not speaking about oneness here. He never said that believers and unbelievers should be mixed together. He said that believers should not kill unbelievers. The Roman Catholic Church has done just that; they are ready to uproot all tares, that is, all those whom they consider to be heretics. We know that they are wrong not only in principle but also in practice. They have uprooted not only the tares but also the wheat. They are wrong both in principle and in practice because they consider Protestants to be heretics.</p><p>The Lord did not tell us to uproot the tares from this world. He said that there should be a proper separation in the church. When the Word speaks of letting both grow together until the harvest, it does not mean to let both grow together in the church. It means to let both grow together in the field&mdash;the world. (In the interpretation of the first parable, the field is the world.) In other words, it is not necessary to remove all nominal Christians from the world. There is no need to kill them as the Roman Catholic Church has tried to do. We should leave them alone in this world. But this does not mean that oneness among Christians should include tares.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Church Not Including Unbelievers</h2><p>Within so-called Christian organizations, sects, and denominations, there are many unbelievers. They tolerate unbelievers, that is, they allow the tares to remain in the church. The Lord did not speak of allowing tares to remain in the church. He only said to allow them to remain in the world. The Lord charges us to keep our Christian oneness in the church, not in the world.</p><p>Today there are many people who, like the Roman Catholic Church, will not tolerate the tares in the world. They try to uproot all the tares from the earth. This is one extreme. Another extreme is to include unbelievers in the church. This is what some groups practice. In the state churches, as long as one is a citizen of that country or born of that country, he can be baptized and be a member of the church. Whoever is born in that country can be a Christian in that country. These churches have opened their doors to unbelievers. This is wrong.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Church Not Being Too Broad</h2><p>When John Wesley drafted the constitution of the Methodist Church, he wrote, "Whoever wishes to escape the coming wrath can be a member of the Methodist Church." Please bear in mind that this is too broad. We admit that we are behind John Wesley in many things; he was a great vessel used by the Lord. There are many things which we have not yet learned; we are behind him in many things. But there is one thing we can tell him: "Brother, do you not think that this statement includes too many people?" In reality the church cannot include all those who wish to escape the coming wrath. Even Buddhists can be counted among those who wish to escape the coming wrath.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Oneness of Christians Including<br />Only God's Children</h2><p>I would like all of us to consider what the church is. The church is a group of people who possess the life of Christ. What is the church? The church is the Body of Christ. Therefore, Christian oneness can only be applied to God's children. It cannot include those who are nominal. They are of the world and are not yet regenerated. They are still sinners in the eyes of God and cannot be included in the church. Therefore, they cannot be part of our oneness.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Matter of Procedure and Principle</h2><p>A servant of the Lord serving in a denomination once said to me, "We receive all saved ones!" I said, "Of course you do! Any church should be expected to receive a saved one. But may I ask whether you reject unsaved ones?" He told me, "You are smart. You can tell who is saved and who is not, but I cannot tell." I mutely agreed but said again, "I am not asking if you know whether a person is saved; I am asking if you would receive someone whom you know is not saved? We are not arguing about facts but about principle. My question is whether you would receive a person whom you know is not saved." He said, "Even if we know that he is not saved, I am afraid that we would still receive him." If a church receives an unsaved person as a matter of principle, it is not the church. We are not talking about facts. For instance, we are not concerned with whether or not Simon in Acts 8 was saved. There are many people who seem to be saved when you talk with them, but who in fact are not saved. In this case there is no violation of principle. But there are some who receive everyone no matter whether or not he is saved. This involves a matter of principle.</p><p>Today we are not quibbling about the procedure of receiving. We are talking about the principle behind our receiving. We may decide to say that all descendants of Hwang-ti are Chinese; this is a matter of principle. If someone makes a mistake by including someone who is Japanese, that is an error in procedure. But if you also decide that a Japanese person should be counted as being Chinese, you are broadening the principle. Throughout the ages there have always been mistakes. We ourselves often make mistakes. We ask God for much mercy, for we have nothing to boast of in ourselves. But we know the Lord's preordained principle that the church cannot open its door to receive unbelievers.</p><p>Therefore, brothers, any group which openly practices the principle of receiving both the saved and the unsaved is not the church; it is the world. If wheat and tares are both present, what we have is not the church of God. In the church everyone should be called ones. If some are called while others are not, what we have is not the church.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Leaving the Organizations of Confusion</h2><p>If a group opens its door widely to both believers and unbelievers, then this is not a Christian group. Their oneness is not Christian oneness. One day the Lord may open one's eyes to see the need to leave this group. If this happens, please bear in mind that he is not forsaking genuine Christian oneness by leaving the group, because there is no Christian oneness with his group; there is only confusion and mixture. When one leaves this kind of group, he does not leave Christian oneness. If there is a group which receives and mixes both believers and unbelievers, both saved and unsaved, God commands us to come out of it!</p><h2 class="head3">1. Our Being the Temple of the Living God</h2><p>Second Corinthians 6:14-16 says, "Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God." You need to know who you are. You are the temple of the living God. Therefore, you cannot have anything to do with idols.</p><p>Verse 16 continues, "Even as God said, `I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.'" You are the temple of the living God. God wants to dwell with you and walk in your midst. God is your God and you are His people.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Coming out from the Midst of the Unbelievers</h2><p>What is the result of this? God's commandment is, "Therefore `come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'" (v. 17). Here we see that we must come out of any Christian group which receives both believers and unbelievers. If there is a mixture of believers and unbelievers in a group, even though it may have the name of the church of Christ, we must still come out of it.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being Right in Principle</h2><p>In principle it is right to stop unbelievers from coming into our midst. Once a brother asked me, "Have you ever received any person by mistake?" My feeling at that time was that we had not received any wrong person. I answered, "Perhaps we have, but the number is quite small." He said, "How then are you different from us?" I said, "If any unbeliever has come into our midst, he came in by climbing over the wall at night. But if there is an unbeliever in your midst, you let him in through an open door at twelve o'clock noon." We must never be proud. We can often be wrong. We can baptize the wrong person and receive the wrong person. However, they will have sneaked in by themselves. We are not wrong in our principle. In so-called Christianity today, as long as a person bears the name of a Christian, he can walk in openly at high noon. It does not mean that we never make any mistakes in procedure. We must be very careful before God not to make any mistakes, but being wrong intentionally or being wrong in principle is another matter. In such a case, we are no longer the church.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Not Needing to Keep Oneness with Non-christians</h2><p>If a group knows that a certain person is an unbeliever yet capriciously admits him, this group surely is not the church. It is not necessary for God's children to maintain oneness with this group. Since this oneness is not Christian oneness, we need not keep it. We are required only to keep the oneness of the wheat; we do not have to keep the oneness between wheat and tares. Today there are many groups on earth which call themselves the church but include both believers and unbelievers. They want to maintain an outward fa&#231;ade of oneness. Please bear in mind that we are not required to keep this kind of oneness. This kind of oneness instead will overturn genuine oneness. The oneness they want to keep is a oneness we want to escape from. Once we get into that kind of oneness, we spoil the genuine oneness.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE BOUNDARY OF ONENESS<br />NOT BEING SMALLER THAN THE BODY</h2><p>There is another very important matter in the boundary of Christian oneness. It is true that Christian oneness includes all of God's children; it is as large as the Body of Christ. Christian fellowship is as broad as the Body of Christ, and the church of Christ is as large as the Body of Christ. This is clearly revealed in the Word of God. As pointed out in the previous section, there is a danger of enlarging the Body of Christ to include false ones. However, another problem arises when God's children maintain a oneness which is smaller than Christian oneness.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Christian Oneness<br />Being a Oneness in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>I would like you to take note of something: God's intention is not just for His children to be one but for them to be one in the Holy Spirit. This is what Christian oneness means. God did not say that we could have any kind or style of oneness. He said that we have to be one in the Spirit. This is why we call this Christian oneness. This oneness is oneness in Christ. In order to keep Christian oneness, we must be kept in Christ, in the Body, and in the oneness of the Spirit. This oneness has a boundary; it is as large as the Body. Please bear in mind that the boundary of Christian oneness is the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Keeping a Oneness That<br />Is Less Than the Body</h2><p>Many people wrongly assume that all God wants is for us to be one. However, if the boundary of their oneness is not the Body of Christ, then this oneness should be condemned. If we maintain any oneness that has a boundary smaller than that of the Body of Christ, we are involved in what the Bible calls a division. God wants us to maintain the oneness in the Spirit. In this oneness the boundary is as large as the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the boundary of that oneness.</p><p>Suppose a group of believers feels that everyone should be baptized by immersion. This is a biblical truth; nothing is wrong with it. But suppose these believers establish a principle of excluding anyone who is not immersed in water, even if such a one is a child of God. If they do this, they are taking a doctrine as the base of their oneness. This is not oneness in the Spirit. Such a group has a boundary that is smaller than the Body.</p><p>Suppose a brother decides to join this kind of group. He has good fellowship with them and receives much spiritual help from them. But one day God opens his eyes to see that though these are genuine children of God, the group as a whole is not the church: It only accepts and meets with those baptized by immersion, and anyone who is not baptized by immersion is not accepted, even though he may be a child of God. When this brother realizes that they have rejected other children of God, he should leave them. He leaves because the Lord has enlightened him.</p><p>Suppose after a while, another brother comes and pleads with him, saying, "We are all Christians, and we are all children of God. We are brothers. God says in the Bible that brothers should love one another. You should not leave us. If you leave, you offend the Christian oneness. If you leave, you are being divisive, and you become a sect and a denomination." After the brother hears this, he may go to his Bible and study it and come to the conclusion that God's children should be one and that he should not have left the group. Do you see the error here? The error here is very obvious.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Leaving a Group Which Is Smaller<br />Than the Body Not Breaking the Oneness</h2><p>If anyone thinks that he should not be divisive, he should first bear in mind what it means to be divisive. Being divisive means being divided from the Body. The division in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to a division from the Body (v. 25), not a separation from a group which is not according to the Body. The Christian oneness which God refers to is a oneness that is as large as the Body. This is the oneness that we should keep and should not come out of. If anyone who is concerned about keeping the oneness is in a group that is smaller and narrower than the Body of Christ, he should realize that this oneness is not Christian oneness or the oneness of the Spirit, even though the group may speak of oneness. It is not Christian oneness because this kind of oneness is not as large as the Body. If he leaves any realm, group, or organization that is not as large as the Body, he is not offending Christian oneness; neither is he breaking it.</p><p>We cannot uphold any boundary or group that comes short of the Body of Christ. We must come out of that "oneness." A child of God who keeps a oneness smaller than the Body of Christ is actually breaking Christian oneness.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Concerning Division</h2><p>There was striving in the church in Corinth. Some were saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (1 Cor. 1:12). Paul was absolutely against this contention. He said, "Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?" (v. 13). He told the Corinthians that they were factious and that this was a work of the flesh (3:3-4). By speaking in this way, the Corinthians were being divisive.</p><h2 class="head4">1. Who the Divisive Ones Are</h2><p>Suppose one of these Corinthians was called Mark, another Stephen, and a third Philemon. Suppose all of them were for Paul. Suppose one day one of these brothers, whether Stephen or Philemon, stood up and said, "We have been meeting together and having good fellowship. We feel that God's servant Paul is particularly used by God and that we should pay more attention to his teachings. We have had good fellowship and have received much help from his speaking and his Epistles. All of us are in the Lord and our fellowship is intimate. But recently I have felt that this is wrong. Today in Corinth there are hundreds of believers, but there are not that many of us. We should go to them and fellowship with them in a proper way."</p><p>Suppose the other brothers stood up and said, "You have sinned! When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He prayed and asked the Father to make us one. The Lord Jesus wants us to be one, but you are trying to leave us for another way. You are not being one with us. You are not glorifying the Lord! If you do not want to be one with us, the world will not believe in the Lord through our oneness. You have sinned, and you must depart from our midst because you are being divisive."</p><h2 class="head4">2. Being Divisive Themselves, yet Condemning<br />Those Who Have Left as Being Divisive</h2><p>Brothers, do you see this? This is what many people say to our brothers. They themselves are being divisive when they say, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ." They have already created many divisions. But as soon as someone wants to leave, they say, "You should keep the Christian oneness." But their oneness is not as large as the Body of Christ. Their oneness is only as large as Paul. It is divisive to keep a oneness that is smaller than the Body of Christ. Even to say that I am of Paul is to be divisive. Please bear in mind that they have already been separated from the Body. They do not see their own divisiveness, but if someone goes out from among them, they say that he is being divisive.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this is the problem of many Christian groups today. Many so-called people of God, many so-called Christian groups, have already separated themselves from the Body. (I hope I will not offend these ones by saying this. Our spirit must be right. Before God we must know that this is something sad, not joyful. But we must be clear of our position before God.) When some brothers or sisters want to return to the Body of Christ, these groups say that those who want to come out of them are being divisive. They do not realize that all those who are in the divisive groups and who refuse to depart from them are being divisive themselves.</p><h2 class="head3">3. It Being Right to Destroy<br />the Oneness of the Sects</h2><p>We ask God to open their eyes to see that the Body of Christ is one and that the sects are divided. In 1934 there were one thousand five hundred major denominations in the world. There are so many groups who call themselves the church. They have reduced the boundary of the Body of Christ. One is a leg, and the other is a hand. They have divided the Body of Christ. Today some brothers and sisters desire to return to the boundary of the Body and have fellowship in the Body. Others rise up immediately and say that they are destroying the oneness. If someone tells you that you have broken the oneness, you should answer by saying that you have broken the oneness of the divisions but you have not broken the oneness of the Body. It is right to say that we have broken the oneness of the divisions. You cannot join the larger oneness unless you first destroy the smaller oneness.</p><h2 class="head4">4. The Need to Come out of the Smaller Oneness<br />into the Larger Oneness</h2><p>The Christian oneness is as narrow as the Body. Anything foreign to the Body must not be brought in. Christian oneness is also as large as the Body. Any so-called oneness that is smaller than the Body cannot be considered Christian oneness. The more you maintain this so-called oneness, the more you are in division. The more intimacy you have built up with your brothers, the more you are sectarian and divisive. You need to come out of the smaller oneness into the larger oneness. If you want to be part of the larger oneness, you must forsake the smaller oneness. Do not think that oneness is good enough by itself; you must ask what kind of oneness it is. Do not say that any oneness is good enough. The only oneness that is good enough is the oneness of the Body. Whatever oneness is smaller than the oneness of the Body should not be endorsed by Christians. No oneness should be smaller than the Body. Anything that is smaller than the Body of Christ is not acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head2">E. What Division Is</h2><p>The word division or sect is hairesis in Greek. It is used nine times in the Bible. It is used six times in Acts, and it is translated "sect," such as the sect of the Sadducees, the sect of the Pharisees, and the Nazarene sect. It is used three times in the Epistles. Let us consider the passages in the Epistles where this word is used.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Division Being Possible Only in the Church</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:18 says, "First of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe." Here it says that the Corinthians were divided among themselves in their meeting. What does it mean to be divided? Division can only be possible in the church. Corinth was a church, and these believers were in the church in Corinth. One day someone said, "I am of Paul." Another person said, "I am of Cephas." A third one said, "I am of Apollos," and a fourth one said, "I am of Christ." The words were wrong, the tone was wrong, and the attitude in spirit was wrong. There were strife and jealousy, and the love of Christ was clearly missing. Whenever they met, those who said that they were of Paul met in one place and those who said that they were of Apollos met in another place. This was division.</p><p>Anyone who wants to accuse another person of being divisive can only raise such an accusation in the church. This accusation is not possible outside the church. A man can only commit the sin of division in the church; he cannot commit such a sin outside the church. A man can revolt only against a legitimate government; he cannot revolt against a government which is itself not legitimate. It is rebellion to separate oneself from a legitimate government, but it is not rebellion to separate oneself from a government that is not legitimate. Therefore, division is something that can only happen in the church. Such division is not well pleasing to God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Division Being the Work of the Flesh</h2><p>Galatians 5:19-20 says, "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as...outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects [hairesis]." One item of the works of the flesh is sects. The Chinese Bible translates it "heresy." In Greek this word is the same word as "division" or "sect." Here we see what division is. Division is a work of the flesh. Paul was telling not only the Galatians and the Corinthians, but also you and me, that division is not a spiritual thing but a work of the flesh. Paul gave an itemized description of all the works of the flesh. He spoke of fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc., and he also spoke of division.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Being Condemned in the Same Way<br />as Fornication and Idolatry</h2><p>When you ask certain ones, "May a Christian commit fornication?" They will answer with a definitive no. If you ask them, "May a Christian worship idols?" They will give you a definitive no as well. But if you ask them, "May Christians be divided?" They may say, "Though they are divided outwardly, they are not divided in their heart." This is like idol worshippers saying, "We are only worshipping idols outwardly. We are not worshipping them in our hearts." There is no excuse for this. Both idolatry and division are condemned in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Not Having Our Own Choices<br />according to the Works of the Flesh</h2><p>It is strange for some who consider themselves servants of God to write books encouraging others to remain in the sects. If a servant of God wrote a book encouraging Christians to worship idols, what would be your response? If a servant of God wrote a book encouraging Christians to commit fornication, to be lascivious, to lose their temper, and to be jealous, what would you think of this? You would feel that this person is surely not a servant of God. But there are people who say that Christians can remain in sects, and many people print their books. The only thing I can say is that men today are blind to what is abominable in the eyes of the Lord! Please bear in mind that we cannot have our own choice according to the flesh. Sectarianism, like idolatry, fornication, anger, and sorcery, is a work of the flesh; these are all on the same condemned list. We must act in a responsible way before God and not be tempted to go back to sectarianism.</p><h2 class="head4">c. How the Word Sect<br />Came to Be Translated as "Heresy"</h2><p>The meaning of the word sect is very clear in Greek. It is translated as "divisions" in 1 Corinthians 11:18 and as "sects" in Galatians 5:20. Actually, they are the same word. Why was this word translated as "heresy" in the King James Version? In Greek the word is hairesis. The translators of the Bible probably chose not to translate the meaning of the word but instead used the word heresy. The King James Version was produced by the Anglican Church, and it had trouble with this verse because it was a state church. This reservation resulted in the use of an ambiguous word. The translators probably knew that this was not the right word, but they used it nevertheless. This same practice can be seen in the Chinese Bibles that use both Shangdi and Shen for the word God. Publishers know quite well that Shangdi is wrong. But because many denominations are familiar with this term, they continue to use it. They publish versions that use both words to cater to the needs of both sides. Another example can be found in the translation of the word baptism. This word should be translated "immersed," but since sprinkling was a prevalent practice, the publishers were not definite in its translation. If immersed had been used, it would have aroused controversy. Those who know Greek know that the word baptism means "to immerse something into water." Yet the translators dared not translate it this way. Instead, they invented a new English word, baptism, which does not mean anything in itself; it keeps a person in the dark as to its true meaning. It is a transliteration of a foreign word. The same principle applies to the translation of the word hairesis. Translating it as "sect" or "division" and calling sectarianism or division a work of the flesh would have aroused controversy. This was the reason the word heresy was used instead. It diverted the reader from understanding its true meaning. Actually, the word heresy is not an English word. No English-speaking person knows what it really means. I know of two brothers who worked at the Gospel Bookstore who were involved with the translation of the Bible. They simply made a transliteration of the word baptizo and put the characters ba-di-zo in its place. I am afraid that not a single soul in China knows what ba-di-zo means, whether it means immersion or sprinkling. No one knows what the word ba-di-zo means, and so both the immersion group and the sprinkling group are happy. This only goes to show man's unfaithfulness. A casual reading of a few other translations will tell you that the word hairesis is actually sect in English. But because of reservations, the word heresy was used instead, and everyone has been kept in the dark as to the true meaning of the word. The Greek word hairesis was anglicized to become heresy in 1611, and the word heresy has been with us for the last three hundred years. By the time the Chinese translated this word, it became i-duan&mdash;heresy, a rather ambiguous word. I can give you other examples of such transliteration of English words.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Not Keeping the Oneness in the Sects</h2><p>Heresy is a sect and is considered by God to be a work of the flesh. Therefore, we cannot keep the oneness of the sects. We must keep Christian oneness but not the oneness of the sects. We break our Christian oneness when we maintain the oneness of the sects.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Sects Bringing Swift Destruction upon Men</h2><p>Second Peter 2:1 says, "But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies [sects], even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction." Sects bring in destruction. They are brought in by the false teachers. We who are of God must learn to uphold Christian oneness before God. We should not maintain any oneness that is smaller than Christian oneness.</p><h2 class="head1">V. ONENESS NOT BEING AN ECUMENICAL WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A. General Awareness among God's Children<br />of the Need of Oneness</h2><p>After a man realizes that sects lead to destruction and that they are condemned by God, he begins to see the need for oneness among Christians. Many people feel that sectarianism and division are wrong, that they should fellowship with all of God's children, and that this fellowship should be as broad as the Body.</p><p>I think this awareness has become quite common in China during the past ten years. Last year someone wrote to me, saying, "Although we cannot agree with your teachings against sectarianism, we feel that it is true and right for Christians to be one." This was written by a leader in Christianity. Today many leaders in Christianity feel that they should pay attention to Christian oneness rather than oneness of the sects.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Ecumenism&mdash;<br />A Oneness That Is a Halfway House</h2><p>I realize that many people have been emphasizing oneness during the past years. But what they have produced is a kind of ecumenical movement. This is not a return to the oneness of the Body. This oneness is man made. It is nothing more than an ecumenical or interdenominational work. This ecumenism accomplishes little more than to de-emphasize denominational distinctions. Personally, I feel that this kind of oneness is just a halfway house; neither side will make it all the way home.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Need for Christians to Be Absolute</h2><p>Let me say a frank word: If sectarianism is right, we should uphold it. If it is wrong, we should destroy it. What do men do today? They say that there is nothing wrong with the sects, yet they oppose them. Or they agree that sectarianism is wrong, yet they try to keep it. On the one hand, they are reluctant to give up sectarianism. On the other hand, they oppose it. They want to keep both sides happy, and they want to maintain fellowship with both groups. This is not a Christian attitude. If the Lord's desire is for His children to have the fellowship of the Body, we should cast aside all other fellowship and only have the fellowship of the Body. I say to them: If you feel that sects are necessary, then you should do your best to uphold them. You may be wrong in conduct, but at least your intention will be right. Christians must not vacillate in their stand. A Christian must be absolute and faithful in whatever he does. If sectarianism is right, we should maintain it at any cost. If it is wrong, we should oppose it at any cost.</p><p>The worst thing to have is a halfway house. On the one hand, they admit that sectarianism is wrong. On the other hand, they are reluctant to give it up, and they try hard to improve it. They admit that denominationalism is wrong, but they try to organize ecumenical affiliations. They are not clear what position they are taking. This is not the Christian way of doing things. A Christian must not change his mind all the time. If something is right, there should be a proper way to handle it. If something is wrong, there should be a proper way to handle it as well. Any compromise or reconciliation is wrong. A Christian should be one who does things in an absolute way. If sectarianism is right, it should be justified. If it is wrong, it should be condemned. There cannot be any compromise or reconciliation.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Ecumenical Affiliations<br />Having the Body as the Boundary<br />but Allowing Sectarianism to Remain</h2><p>We have already referred to different types of oneness. One type has a boundary greater than that of the Body; it receives even the tares. Another type has a boundary that is smaller than the Body; it is an organization, a sect. Still another type has a boundary that is as large as the Body of Christ, but within this boundary there are segregated squares. It is like a checkerboard. The boundary is as large as the Body of Christ, yet there are sects in it. Each minds his own business within his sphere. This is organized unity, not unity itself; it is an affiliation of oneness, not oneness itself. Although the boundary of this kind of fellowship is as large as the Body, there are still many sects within this fellowship. According to statistics in the 1930s, there were at least fifteen hundred of these little squares.</p><p>If the church should be divided into sects, God would surely have spoken of it clearly in the Bible. But God tells us in the Bible that the church is the Body. There is only one Body, and every member is joined to this Body. This is the only possible way to go. Even a machine or a car cannot be divided. If it is divided, it cannot function. Today many sects are striving to unite themselves. I feel compelled to point out the ground upon which such ecumenical boundaries are based.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Body Not Having an Organization<br />as Its Basic Unit</h2><p>The Bible says that the Body is made up of members. Therefore, the members are the basic units of the Body. Today ecumenical workers see the Body of Christ, but they are not willing to pay the price to take the fellowship of the Body. They emphasize the Body of Christ, yet the Body which they speak of does not have the members as its unit but organizations as its unit. The basic unit of Christian fellowship should be Christians. It is Christians who are joined together to form the Body. But the ecumenical affiliations of today take certain organizations as their basic unit. In other words, if there are five thousand denominations throughout the world, they say that there are five thousand basic units in the Body. This can only be called a fellowship of organizations.</p><p>The fellowship in the Bible takes individual Christians as its basic unit. I am a believer, and you are a believer. The two of us spontaneously have fellowship. Another person is a believer, and as a believer, you will have fellowship with him as well. The fellowship is always carried out on an individual basis. Today ecumenical workers lump believers together into organizations and then unite the many organizations. Something more has been added to the fellowship of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Organizations Giving Ground to the Flesh</h2><p>The Bible puts all of God's children together in the Body of Christ. Together they express His Body on earth. But today men have united those with the same opinions, beliefs, and views. They have united men who respect the same persons and have formed them into organizations. As a further step, they try to form associations of different organizations. They are, in reality, first dividing to go along with man's will and then uniting to go along with God's intention. In this way they think that they have satisfied both sides! Fleshly sectarianism is allowed to remain, while Christian oneness is seemingly achieved. This is what ecumenical affiliations are all about. I say again emphatically that the only purpose for doing this is to give ground to the flesh. The Lord has shown us that division is a work of the flesh.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you do not have to go to the denominations to find out that sectarianism is a work of the flesh. You can find this within yourself. If you have to go to other places to find this out, I question your spiritual condition before God. Human beings are prone to division. Everyone likes to separate himself from other brothers and sisters according to his own will. Today many people like to keep denominations on the one hand and try to arrive at some form of unity on the other. This is self-contradictory! They think that denominationalism can remain, and they try to preserve it. But then they join themselves to ecumenical affiliations because their conscience is bothered. This is to divide the Body first and then to try to unite it later.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Ecumenical Union Being the Product<br />of a Condemned Conscience</h2><p>If you try to divide the Body into denominations and then unite them again, you no longer have the Body! To unite something after cutting it apart results merely in an association, not the Body. You should not think that you will have the same person after cutting him into pieces and then putting the pieces together again. There is no such thing. The life is gone! It is foolish to cut the Body of Christ into hundreds of denominations and then to unite them again! That is not the Body. That is just a union of organizations. I hope you will see before God the error of dividing the Body of Christ into many denominations. When the members are together, it is the Body, and when they are apart, they are the members. This is all we know. Other than these two things&mdash;the Body and the members&mdash;there is no intermediate organization. There is no such thing as grouping members into many organizations and then uniting all these organizations into a Body. This kind of ecumenical union is not the Body of Christ, but human organization. It is the product of a condemned conscience.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. MAINTAINING THE ONENESS</h2><p>How then should this oneness be maintained? If unbelievers were accepted into the church in Foochow, it would no longer be the church. We would have to call it a sect and leave it. Suppose some churches are composed entirely of believers, yet there is the element of sectarianism in them. We must also leave such groups. Then there are those who unite various organizations together to become larger ecumenical affiliations. This is also the work of the flesh, and we must leave them as well.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Need to Stand in the Position<br />of the Body of Christ</h2><p>If we are to have the church in Foochow today, it must have a boundary that is as large as the Body of Christ. Whether or not others like it is their own concern. Whether or not others would take this way is up to them. But those who want to take this way must be faithful to take a stand; they must not be sectarian. They must not willfully allow any unbelievers in their midst, and they must not replace the Body with ecumenical organizations. This is the basic principle. We must stand on the ground of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ dictates the boundary for the church. This is our way today. This is the only way for God's children to take in every locality.</p><p>We must be clear about the position we should take. We cannot be sectarian or divisive. We must not have unbelievers among us, and we cannot replace the Body of Christ with ecumenical organizations. Ecumenical organizations speak of the operation of light but the absence of the strength to obey this light. It tells us that there is the knowledge of God's will but the reluctance to keep this will. There is God's revelation but a failure to carry it out. It is nothing more than a halfway house.</p><p>God has placed us in another position, the position for all the children of God to meet. But others will not come to us. We are not saying that others must acknowledge what we say we are. We are merely saying that we are taking a stand for the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Acknowledging the House of God</h2><p>We admit that there are brothers and sisters in the sects, the state churches, and the ecumenical organizations. If they are faithful, they should come home; they should take the same stand as we have taken&mdash;a stand for the Body. Today our door is open to them. However, we have no other choice but to keep our own standing. What is the situation today? It is like a family with two young brothers who have been kidnapped by robbers. You cannot disband the family just because two brothers have been kidnapped. There are still the father, the mother, and the other brothers and sisters in the family. The family cannot be disbanded. However, we have to say that there is no peace in the family now because two brothers have been kidnapped.</p><p>Those who have been kidnapped are temporarily away from the family. However, the other brothers at home should have a broad heart. They should not shut their brothers out just because they have been kidnapped. They should learn to open their door and their heart to them. Whenever the kidnapped ones come home, they should be welcomed with open arms. Thank God, they may come back for a short time, or they may come back forever. They may have lived a wandering life for a long time, but we have to say that this is still their home. We cannot shut the door to them just because they have left us.</p><p>Some have said that too many people are wandering in the denominations today and therefore God's church has disbanded and is no longer in existence. But God's children on earth can never be disbanded; they can never cease to exist. Today we must do our best to uphold our testimony. Our Father is here, our Lord is here, and the Holy Spirit is here. As long as we have these, that is enough! As long as we have three or five brothers, that is enough. Two or three brothers is enough for a testimony. In some places, we have even more than this!</p><h2 class="head2">C. Learning to Be Humble and Not Proud</h2><p>Never boast and say, "I have a home already. I do not care whether other brothers are wandering outside." Something is wrong with our family if we do not feel this loss in our family. As long as a brother or a sister is still wandering in the denominations, our heart should ache and we should be sad. We should always have two attitudes. On the one hand, we have to uphold and maintain our stand. On the other hand, we must not be proud. We must stand on the proper ground and persevere in it. But while we maintain that stand, our heart must not become uplifted. We must not say, "We are the family. We are satisfied." We must remember that there are still other members of the family who are wandering outside. We must humble ourselves and learn to petition on their behalf. We pray that they will all come home. The door is always open to them. Whether they will come home for good or for a short time, we must always maintain our stand as a family. We must never be so wrong as to think that the church does not exist today. There is no such thing!</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE BASIS OF ONENESS&mdash;JUDGMENT</h2><p>Finally, I would like you to remember something. The oneness of the Body is a oneness not only among Christians, but a oneness with God and with His presence.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God's Presence Bringing in His Judgment</h2><p>In the Old Testament, whenever God's presence was manifested, His judgment was executed as well. The presence of God means the presence of judgment. God is holy. There is no question of judgment where His presence is not felt. But as soon as there is His presence, there is judgment. If we want to maintain Christian oneness, we must uphold His presence. His presence means judgment and the law. He executes judgment on everything that is wrong. Where His presence is lacking, the requirement is not stringent. But where His presence is manifested, no sin can be tolerated. If the church tolerates sin and covers things up, there cannot be the possibility of maintaining any oneness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Forsaking Sins Being the Basis of Oneness</h2><p>I would like to draw your attention to the basis of our oneness. This is fundamental. The basis of our oneness is the forsaking of sins. Please bear in mind that God's children are divided today because of the problem of sins. The matter of sins is always implicated. Because of many sins, there are many divisions. Many of God's children have a basic misunderstanding; they think that patience and forbearance are the basis of oneness. There is no such thing as this. The Bible never takes patience or forbearance as the basis of our oneness. The Bible always takes the forsaking of sins as the basis of our oneness.</p><p>If anyone wants to have fellowship with God today, he must walk in the light. We will have fellowship with one another when we are in the light. We may say that fellowship is the basis of our oneness, but the basis of fellowship is our dealing with sin and our removal of sin. When all of us are in God's light, we have fellowship one with another. Other than this, there is no fellowship.</p><p>Second Corinthians 6 shows us that when we separate ourselves, God becomes our Father and we become His children (vv. 17-18). God's fellowship with us is based on our separation. Do not keep men's natural ties at the expense of God's fellowship. This is where many people have failed!</p><p>Who are the vessels of honor in the eyes of God? They are those who have cleansed themselves from dishonor. If a man cleanses himself from dishonor, he becomes a vessel unto honor. Those who call upon the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness. Only those who depart from unrighteousness can call upon the name of the Lord. If a man cleanses himself, he becomes a vessel unto honor. If a man is a vessel unto honor, he can pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22). Only those who draw their swords and take a stand on God's side to kill their own brothers are qualified to be Levites (Exo. 32:26-28).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Paying the Price to Maintain Oneness</h2><p>The boundary of oneness can only be maintained with a price. Do not think that you can be one by having more love and forbearance. There is no such thing. The basis of oneness is the removal of sin. Anything that offends Christian oneness must be removed. Today Christians are not one not because there is a lack of love but because sin has not been removed. It is true that many people have considerable human patience and affection. But such things are useless in achieving oneness.</p><p>Today when God opens a person's eyes to see the Body, the boundary of the church, and the oneness among Christians, and when this person disentangles himself from all human affection and tolerance, he will spontaneously take a step forward in his pursuit of the Lord. If you cannot go on, you can only blame your eyes for the lack of light and your heart for not being single enough. Do not blame those who have gone on. You must realize that only those who have a desire to depart from sins, unrighteousness, and dishonor, and who will give up the affection of the brothers and take a stand for the Body, will have eyes to see. Today it does not matter how much others embrace you with human affection or talk to you about oneness. You have to pay the price; you must depart from unrighteousness. You must see the Body of Christ. You must sacrifice human affection and love. Once you sacrifice them, spontaneously you will be one with others who take the same stand. The basis of oneness is the forsaking of unrighteousness, not the forbearance or endurance of unrighteousness.</p><p>Everywhere we find unrighteousnesses, offenses, and trespasses against the Body of Christ. If a person is faithful and obedient, you can join yourself to him. But if you want to maintain any other type of oneness, you must be prepared to be defiled with sins and unrighteousnesses. If you do that, you can, of course, be one with those who practice such things.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Oneness among God's Children Realized<br />When Everyone Rises Up to Condemn Sins</h2><p>Many people condemn those who have separated themselves for not having enough forbearance, love, or patience. But no, the ones who have separated themselves are not lacking in patience; rather, those who have not separated themselves are lacking in obedience. Those who have left are not short of love, but those who remain are short of light before God. Those who leave are not hardened in heart, but those who remain are wavering before God.</p><p>If God's children will all rise up to condemn sin, there will be oneness in our Christian fellowship. If they will all judge sin, there will be Christian oneness. If all of God's people will submit to God, we will see the oneness of the Body. Spontaneously the flesh, the sects, and the divisions will disappear, and God's children will become one.</p><p>The basis of oneness is not the forbearance of sin. The basis of oneness is the judgment of sin. There is no possibility of oneness between those who judge and those who do not. If you want to be one with all the children of God, you must take a stand together with all the children of God in judging sin. If they judge sin and you do not, how can you be one with them? Those who walk out are not wrong; those who remain are wrong. Those who judge sin are right; they are one with all those who judge sin throughout the world. We ask God to have mercy on those who will not judge sin, so that they also will rise up to judge sin. We ask God to show them that oneness and light are possible only outside of organizations, methods, associations, and sects. The Body of Christ is the unique sphere of the oneness among God's children.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">LOVING THE BROTHERS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 5:24; 1 John 3:14</h1><p>The Gospel of John was the last Gospel written, and the Epistles of John were the last Epistles written. Before the Gospel of John there are three Gospels, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which cover many acts and teachings of the Lord Jesus. The Gospel of John shows us the highest and most spiritual things concerning the coming of the Son of God to earth. It tells us clearly what kind of people can receive eternal life. It repeatedly says that those who believe have eternal life. The Gospel of John is full of the matter of believing. A person receives eternal life when he believes. This is the subject and emphasis of the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John pays special attention to things that the other Gospels do not cover. John 5:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." In other words, those who hear and believe have passed out of death into life. Here the door of the gospel is very wide.</p><p>When we come to the Epistles, Paul, Peter, and the other apostles also explain faith in a very clear way. They show us that every believer can receive grace. Yet when we come to the final Epistles, the Epistles written by John, we find the emphasis shifting to other things. While the other Epistles pay much attention to a man's faith in God, John emphasizes one aspect of practical conduct before God. His Epistles speak of love. The other Epistles say that those who believe are justified, forgiven, and cleansed. But John's Epistles say that  a person's faith must be evidenced by his love.</p><p>If we ask someone, "How do you know that you have eternal life?" he may answer, "God's Word says so." But this is not quite enough. He may have spoken it out of his mental knowledge; he may not have truly believed in God's Word. Therefore, John shows us in his Epistles that if a man says that he has eternal life, he must prove it. If a man says that he is of God, others must witness some kind of manifestation or testimony in him.</p><p>A person may say, "I have believed; therefore, I have eternal life." He may say this based on his knowledge. He can make the process of believing and having eternal life a formula: First, one hears the gospel; second, he understands; third, he believes; and fourth, he knows that he has eternal life. But this kind of formulaic "salvation" is not trustworthy. The Bible tells us that at the time of Paul there were false brothers (2 Cor. 11:26; Gal. 2:4). False brothers are those who call themselves brothers but are not actually brothers. Some claim to be of God but are actually void of life. They make their way into the church through doctrines, knowledge, and certain regulations. How can we know whether or not a person's faith is genuine? How do we know whether a person's faith before God is living or merely a formula? What way is there to prove who is of God and who is not? The Epistles of John settle this problem. John gave us a way to differentiate between true brothers and false brothers, between those who are born of God and those who are not born of God. Let us look at John's way of discernment.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LIFE OF LOVE</h2><p>There are only two passages in the Bible which contain the phrase out of death into life. One is in John 5:24, and the other is in 1 John 3:14. Let us make a comparison between these two portions.</p><p>John 5:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." Here it says that he who believes has passed out of death into life.</p><p>First John 3:14 says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers." This verse speaks of the proof of one's having passed out of death into life. The proof is love for the brothers.</p><p>Suppose you have many friends and you like them very much, or you admire many people and respect them very much. There is still a difference between your feelings toward them and your feelings toward the brothers and sisters in your own family. Somehow, there is a difference. If a person is born of your mother, if he is your brother, there is spontaneously a special and inexplicable feeling toward him. It is a feeling of instinctive love. This feeling proves that you and he belong to the same family.</p><p>The same holds true for our spiritual family. Suppose there is a person whose appearance, family background, education, disposition, and interest are totally different from yours. Yet he has believed in the Lord Jesus. Spontaneously, you will have an inexplicable feeling toward him. You will feel that he is your brother. He will be dearer to you than your brother in the flesh. This feeling proves that you have passed out of death into life.</p><p>First John 5:1 says, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who has begotten loves him also who has been begotten of Him." This is a very precious word. If you love God who has begotten you, it is only natural that you will love those who are begotten of God. It is impossible to say that you love God and yet have no feeling toward your brothers.</p><p>This love is proof that the faith we have acquired is a genuine faith. Such unspeakable love can only issue from genuine faith. This love for the brothers is something very special. A person loves for no other reason than the fact that the other person is a brother. He does not love because there is a common bond of interest. He loves simply because the other person is his brother. It is possible for two persons with different educational backgrounds, temperaments, family backgrounds, opinions, and views to love each other simply because both are believers. Both are brothers, and spontaneously they have fellowship one with another. There is an unspeakable feeling and taste toward each other. This feeling and taste is the proof that they have passed out of death into life. We know that we have passed out of death into life if we love the brothers.</p><p>It is true that faith brings us to God. Through faith we pass out of death into life, and through faith we are made members of the household of God and are regenerated. But faith brings us not only to the Father but also to the brothers. Once we have this life, we will have a feeling for the many people throughout the world who also have this life. Spontaneously, this life will draw us toward those who have the same life. This life takes pleasure in their presence; it delights in communicating with them and has a spontaneous love for them.</p><p>The Gospel of John and the Epistles of John show us God's ordained order: First, faith brings us out of death into life, and then those who have passed out of death into life have this love. By loving the brothers, we know that we have passed out of death into life. This is a very reliable way to ascertain the number of God's children on earth. Only those who love one another are brothers; those who do not love one another are not brothers.</p><p>Brothers and sisters! We must realize that in the eyes of God our love for the brothers is a test of the genuineness of our faith. We have no better way to tell whether a person's faith is true or false. In the absence of this discernment, the more perfectly the gospel is preached, the greater will be the danger of counterfeits. The more thoroughly the gospel is preached, the easier it will be for false ones to come in. The more the gospel is preached with grace, the more careless ones will creep in. There must be a way to discern and recognize genuine faith from counterfeit faith. The Epistles of John show us clearly that the way to differentiate true faith from false faith is not through faith itself but through love. There is no need to ask how great one's faith is. It is necessary only to ask how great his love is. Where there is genuine faith, there will be love. The lack of love proves the absence of faith. The presence of love proves the presence of faith. When we approach faith through the gateway of love, everything will become clear to us.</p><p>Whether or not a person is a genuine Christian depends on whether he has a special taste for and attraction toward other children of God. The life which God has given us is not an independent life. It is a life which spontaneously draws us toward those with the same life. It loves and desires mutual intimacy. Those who have such feelings have passed out of death into life.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE</h2><p>First John 3:11 says, "For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."</p><p>Verse 23 says, "And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us."</p><p>Loving one another is a commandment from God. God commands us to do two things: to believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and to love one another. We have already believed. Now we also should love. God gave us this love, and He also gave us the commandment to love. God first gave us this love and then He gave us the commandment to love one another. Today we must love one another according to God's commandment. We must also love one another with the love which God has given us. We must exercise the love which God has put into us. We must apply it according to its nature. We should never quench it or hurt it.</p><p>First John 4:7-8 says, "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God. He who does not love has not known God, because God is love."</p><p>We must love one another, because love is of God. Those who have love are begotten of God. Those who do not love have not known God because God Himself is love. When God begot us, He also begot love in us. We were without love, but today we have love. Today the love we possess is from God. God has begotten love in everyone who is born of God. God has given love to both you and others. This is why we can love one another.</p><p>Those who are begotten of God have received a life&mdash;a life which is God Himself. God is love; therefore, those who are begotten of God have such a love begotten within them. The life which we have received from God is a life of love. Everyone who is begotten of God has love in him, and everyone who has love in him spontaneously loves the brothers. It would be strange if we could not love one another. God gave every Christian a life of love. He also gave him the commandment of love based upon this life of love: "Let us love one another." God first gives us the love, and then He tells us to love. He first gives us a life of love, and then the commandment of love. We should bow our heads and say, "Thank You! God's children can now love one another."</p><h2 class="head1">III. IF ONE DOES NOT LOVE THE BROTHERS</h2><p>Now let us consider all the verses under this category in 1 John.</p><p>First John 2:9-11 says, "He who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now. He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him; but he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes." Are you clear? Whether or not a man is a brother and whether or not he walks in the light and turns away from darkness are determined by whether or not he loves his brother.</p><p>If a person knows that you are a brother and yet he hates you in his heart, it proves that he is not a Christian. If he has seen five brothers and says, "I love four of them, but I hate one in my heart," it proves that he is not a brother. We must realize that we do not love a brother because he is lovable but because he is a brother. We love him because he is a brother. This is the only reason for us to love. If a person knows that you are a brother and are of the Lord yet still hates you, it proves that he has no life in him. Here it says, "He who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness." He is in the darkness and he walks in the darkness. In other words, the Bible denies the possibility that anyone can hate his brothers; it does not accept this as a possibility at all. If you know that a person is a brother and yet hate him, you must say, "Lord, I am not walking in the light. I am in the darkness and am walking in the darkness."</p><p>First John 3:10 says, "In this the children of God...are manifest. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother." He who does not practice righteousness outwardly is not of God. In the same way, he who does not have an inward love for his brother is not of God. He who does not love his brother is not of God, because this love and this feeling are not in him. In this the children of God are manifest.</p><p>Verse 14 says, "He who does not love abides in death." This love does not refer to ordinary love but to the love with which one loves his brothers. If a person does not have such a love for the brothers within him, the Bible says that he "abides in death." We can understand why a person has no feeling or attraction for other believers before he believes. But it would be very strange if, after believing, he still has no feeling or attraction toward other believers. His faith may not be that genuine. "He who does not love abides in death." Formerly, such a person was dead. I am afraid that he is still dead because faith is based on love. Whether or not a person's faith is genuine depends on whether there is love. Those who believe in God have a love for the brothers. If love is absent, it proves that the person still abides in death.</p><p>Verse 15 says, "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him." We cannot imagine that any person would still murder after becoming a believer. The Bible tells us that to hate one's brother is to murder. A person who has eternal life should never hate his brother. Hating the brothers proves that there is no love in him. It means that eternal life is not in him.</p><p>God's children can be in many different conditions, but they can never hate. If there is a brother who is offensive in certain ways, we may not like him in our heart. If there is a brother who has committed a sin worthy of excommunication, we may deal with the matter with indignation. If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord. But we can never hate our brothers. If a brother hates another brother, eternal life is not in him.</p><p>Every child of God has a life rich enough to love all the brothers and sisters. As long as a person belongs to the Lord, he deserves a believer's love. Our love for any one brother should be the same as our love for all the brothers. The brotherly love that is applied toward one brother should be equally applicable to all the brothers. This kind of love for the brothers makes no distinction. As long as one is a brother, he deserves this love. If anyone hates a brother, it proves that he does not have eternal life in him. He does not have to hate all the brothers. As long as he hates one brother, it is enough to prove that he does not have brotherly love in him. The brotherly love that we are speaking about is a love that loves all the brothers.</p><p>This is a very sobering thought. If a believer does not love his brother but hates him instead, or if he threatens or attacks his brother, we can say only, "May God be merciful to him! Here is a person who thinks that he is a believer and yet he is not saved at all!" As long as he hates a brother, it proves that he is not of the Lord. This is a serious matter!</p><p>Under normal circumstances, if a brother has done things which irritate you, you can exhort him and rebuke him, but you cannot hate him. If he has done something which provokes you, you may be angry with him and rebuke him severely. But there cannot be any hatred in you. Even if you "tell it to the church," according to Matthew 18, your intention should still be to gain him and restore him. If you have no intention of restoring him and if your goal is only to attack him and tear him down, it proves that you are less than a brother. The brother spoken of in Matthew 18 told the church because he wanted to gain his brother. The whole issue is whether your goal is to tear down your brother or to gain him. This is quite a serious matter. We must not take it lightly!</p><p>Concerning the fornicator in 1 Corinthians 5:13, Paul said, "Remove the evil man from among yourselves." At the beginning Paul delivered such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh in the name of the Lord Jesus and with the power of the Lord Jesus because the Corinthians did not do anything to cast him out. Is this kind of dealing too severe? It was indeed extremely severe. But Paul did this so that the man's spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord (v. 5). The purpose for his flesh being destroyed in the present time was so that he would not suffer eternal loss. The purpose of telling it "to the church" in Matthew 18 is for restoration; the removing in 1 Corinthians 5 is also for restoration.</p><p>When Joshua judged Achan, he said, "My son, give glory to Jehovah" (Josh. 7:19). Though Achan had committed a great sin, he spoke to Achan with such a spirit and such brotherly love.</p><p>David took hold of his clothes and tore them when a young messenger brought the news of Saul's death to him. He mourned, wept, and fasted until the evening (2 Sam. 1:11-12). When someone told David about Absalom's death, David was much moved. He wept, saying, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you!" (18:33). Saul was a king who hated David, and Absalom was David's rebellious son. Yet David wept when they died. He had to fight the battles, and he had to judge, but he could not restrain his tears. He had to judge, and he had to condemn, but he could not hold back his tears.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if a person can only judge and condemn but has no tears or sadness, it proves that he does not know anything about brotherly love. If anyone rebukes a brother only for the purpose of tearing him down, such a one has no love in him, only hatred. To hate the brothers is to murder them! This is a very serious matter!</p><p>A brother once wrote to J. N. Darby about the matter of excommunication. Darby's first words were, "I think it is the most dreadful thing for a sinner whose sins have been forgiven to excommunicate another sinner." There is nothing more dreadful than for a sinner whose sins are forgiven to excommunicate another sinner. Mr. Darby's reaction was something that issued from a life of love. No doubt, there are many things which need to be addressed. We can excommunicate a sinful brother or sister from the church if it becomes necessary to do so. But we must never harbor any hatred in dealing with them.</p><p>First John 4:20-21 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also." Here John shows us that to love one's brothers is equal to loving God. He who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. We should love our brothers if we want to love God. This is the commandment which we have received from God.</p><p>We must be careful not to do anything that will offend love. We should not offend our brothers lightly. We must love one another and must honor the brotherly love that has been placed in our hearts. We should not put aside such a heart. God has placed this heart in us so that we can use it to serve and help the brothers. We should allow this brotherly love to grow, to be strengthened, and to be empowered.</p><p>First John 3:17 says, "But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?" John did not say, "How does the love of the brothers abide in him?" He said, "How does the love of God abide in him?" because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God. The love of God does not abide in a person who shuts up his love for his brother. He cannot deceive himself by saying, "Although I do not love my brother, I love God." Our relationship with the brothers comes from our relationship with God. If we are not related to the brothers, it means that we are not related to God. If we reject our brothers, the love of God is not in us.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HOW TO LOVE THE BROTHERS</h2><p>First John 3:16 says, "In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf." What does it mean to love the brothers? John goes on to explain it. We do not know what love is until we see how the Lord laid down His life for us. John continues by saying, "And we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers." A love for the brothers is a willingness to lay ourselves aside to serve them. It is a willingness to deny oneself for the perfection of others, and a heart that will even lay down one's very own life for his brothers.</p><p>Verse 18 says, "Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness." Brotherly love is not just empty words; it is manifested in deed and truthfulness.</p><p>First John 4:10-12 says, "Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us." This shows us that our love toward God and our love toward one another cannot be separated. The love of God is perfected in us if we love one another. Today God has put many brothers before us for us to practice our love for God. The love of God is perfected in us if we love one another. We should not say in a vain way that we love God. We must learn to love the brothers in a real way. It is vanity to merely talk about love. Our love for God must be expressed in our love for the brothers.</p><p>First John 5:2-3 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." If we love God, we must keep His commandments. Likewise, if we love God's children, we must keep His commandments. For example, God's commandment says that we should be baptized by immersion. But many of God's children hold different opinions. They say, "I do not agree with baptism by immersion. If you love me, you should not be baptized by immersion. This will hurt me." What should we do? God commands us to leave the denominations and not remain in any sects; however, many of God's children promote the denominations. They say, "You should not leave the denominations. You will hurt us if you leave the denominations." What should we do? We must leave the denominations if we want to love God, and we should stay in the denominations if we want to love our brothers. This puts us in a dilemma. But verse 2 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments." In other words, we cannot say that we love God's children if we do not keep God's commandments. Suppose a brother is touched by God to be baptized by immersion. He should be baptized if he loves God's children. If he is not baptized, he will affect other children of God; they also may choose not to be baptized. This will hinder them from obeying God. This is not the way to love them. If we keep all the commandments of God, we will know that we have loved His children. We will have taken the way of obedience. Now other children can take the same way. If we choose not to obey just because we are afraid that we may hurt them by our obedience, we will have no way to go on, and they will have no way to go on as well. We must learn to love God, and we must keep all His commandments. It is by loving Him and keeping His commandments that we know we love His children. We must keep all the commandments of God. This is the only way to lead God's children to the way of obedience. Consider another illustration: Suppose your parents do not allow you to believe in the Lord. What should you do? Would you deny the Lord for the sake of loving them? If you listen to them and deny the Lord, you are not practicing love at all! If you do not listen to them and instead believe in the Lord, they may be angry with you for a time, but you have opened a way for them to believe in the Lord. This is love!</p><p>However, we must not offend our parents in attitude or in words. It is right for us to obey and follow God's commandments, but we must not offend our parents in our attitude and our words. We need to hold fast to God's truth, and at the same time, we need to maintain love. We must learn to be righteous from the very beginning of our Christian life. At the same time, we must not give up love. Do not emphasize the holiness of the life of God at the expense of the love found in His life. These two aspects should balance one another. We want to obey God, but we must obey in an attitude of meekness. Do not offend love in any way. If something needs to be done, do it. But never do anything which offends love. We must be gentle in our attitude. Even when there are differences of opinion among the brothers, we must still remain gentle. We must be full of love when we tell our brother, "Brother, how I wish to see what you have seen. But God has shown me otherwise, and I have no choice but to obey Him." Do not lower the standard of God's Word; neither offend love. On the one hand, be obedient to God. On the other hand, love. We must show our brother that we are not doing something for ourselves; we are doing it because God has said so. Our attitude must be right, and we must be full of meekness. This will gain many brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT OF LOVE</h2><p>First John 4:16 says, "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him." This is the second occurrence in this Epistle of the phrase God is love. Because God is love, He wants us to love the brothers and abide in love. As long as we abide in love, we abide in God.</p><p>Verses 17 and 18 say, "In this has love been perfected with us, that we have boldness in the day of the judgment....There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear." First John 4 is the only place in the entire Bible that tells us how to stand boldly before the judgment seat. It tells us the secret: Abide in love. To abide in love is to abide in God. We will have boldness in the day of judgment when this love is perfected in us.</p><p>We must have only one thought toward our brothers and sisters&mdash;love. We must gain them and seek their highest benefit. There must be no hatred, only love. This practice is an exercise for us. One day our whole being will abide in love, and love will also abide in us. Then our lives on earth will be free from all fear. There is no fear when we love. When we stand before the judgment seat, we will not be afraid of anything. This life of love will operate among us until fear is gone. The fruit of the Spirit&mdash;love&mdash;will give us the boldness to stand before the judgment seat.</p><p>We have already seen that to love the brothers is to love God. Our love for the brothers will cause the love of God to be perfected in us. We can love the brothers to such an extent that there is no more fear in us toward the brothers. Loving God and loving the brothers always go together. We must love the brothers on earth if we want to love God. If we do, love is perfected in us, and we will have the boldness on the day of judgment. This is a wonderful thing.</p><p>May we all give ourselves to learn to love the brothers from the very beginning of our Christian life. May the life of love find an outlet in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRIESTHOOD</h1><p>The Bible speaks of the ministry of the priesthood. This ministry consists of a group of people wholly separated from the world to serve God. They have no other occupation or duty other than to serve God. Such people are called priests in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Beginning from the book of Genesis, we find God calling men to be priests. Melchisedec was God's first priest. In Abraham's time, Melchisedec separated himself and gave himself solely to God's service.</p><h2 class="head2">A. From Genesis to the Period<br />after the Lord's Ascension</h2><p>From Genesis to the forming of the nation of Israel and thereafter, the priesthood was always present. At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth and even after His departure from the earth, the priesthood did not cease. The priesthood has been on earth for a long time. The Bible shows us that even the Lord Jesus became a priest before God after His ascension to the heavens. He is there now fully consecrated for God's service.</p><h2 class="head2">B. In the Dispensation of the Church</h2><p>The priesthood continues throughout the dispensation of the church; there is no interruption of any kind.</p><h2 class="head2">C. In the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>At the beginning of the millennial kingdom, those who share in the first resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years (Rev. 20:6). God's children will continue to be God's priests and Christ's priests for a thousand years. They will be kings to the world and priests to God. This priesthood will remain unchanged; they will still serve God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. In the New Heavens and New Earth</h2><p>In the new heavens and new earth, the term priest will cease to exist. At that time, all of God's children as His servants will do nothing except serve Him. In the New Jerusalem "His slaves will serve Him" (22:3). In other words, God's children will continue to serve Him.</p><p>Here we must point out a most wonderful thing. The priesthood commenced with Melchisedec, the one who was without father, without mother, without genealogy, who had neither beginning of days nor end of life (Heb. 7:3), and it extends to the end of the millennium, which means that it extends to eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE KINGDOM OF PRIESTS<br />BECOMING THE HOUSE OF PRIESTS</h2><p>According to the revelation of the Scripture, God's purpose is not to have only one or two persons as His priests. His purpose is to have all His people as His priests.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God Choosing the Israelites<br />to Be a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>After the Israelites came out of Egypt, they came to Mount Sinai. God charged Moses to speak to the Israelites, saying, "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation" (Exo. 19:6). God told the Israelites that they would be a kingdom of priests. This expression is somewhat difficult to understand. Why did God say that they would be a kingdom of priests? He meant that He wanted the whole nation to be priests. No one in the nation would be an ordinary person; the whole kingdom would be priests. This was God's purpose.</p><p>When God chose Israel to be His people, He set this goal before them. This nation was to be different from all other nations on the earth. It was a kingdom of priests. All the people of this nation would be priests. This meant that every person in the nation would have one unique occupation, the occupation of serving God. God delights in separating men from the earth for His service. He delights in seeing men live solely for His affairs. God wants all of His children to be priests and to serve Him.</p><p>God told the people of Israel when they reached Mount Sinai that He would make them a kingdom of priests. This is a wonderful calling. We call England "the kingdom of the navy," the United States, "the kingdom of gold," China, "the kingdom of manners and virtues," and India "the kingdom of philosophers." But here is a kingdom which is called "the kingdom of priests." This is a wonderful thing. Everyone in this nation is a priest. Men, women, adults, and children are all priests. Everyone in this kingdom serves only God. Both adults and children have only one thing as their occupation&mdash;offering sacrifices and serving God. This is a wonderful picture.</p><p>After God promised to establish Israel as a kingdom of priests, He told Moses to go up the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments which were written upon two tablets of stone. Moses remained on the mountain forty days while God wrote the Ten Commandments on the stone tablets. The first commandment says, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." The second says, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image" (20:3-4). It seems that God was dictating the commandments one by one.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Israelites Serving the Idols</h2><p>While Moses was up on the mountain, the people at the foot of the mountain wondered about his delay. They said to Aaron, "Up, make us gods, which shall go before us" (32:1). Aaron succumbed to their words, collected gold, and made a golden calf. The people then worshipped the golden calf and said, "These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" (v. 4).</p><p>They began to worship the idol. They sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. They indulged in great celebration. At last they had found a visible golden god for themselves. The God that Moses taught was mysterious; one could not identify where He lived or where He could be located. Even Moses, the one who worshipped this God, was nowhere to be found. Now there was a visible golden calf which they could worship. God had appointed them to be priests, but even before they were able to be His priests, they became priests to the golden calf. God's desire was for them to be a kingdom of priests. But even before they could do that, they had turned to idol worship and served the golden calf. They established other gods and other forms of worship apart from Jehovah their God.</p><p>This is man's concept of God. Man always tries to make his own god and worship according to his own ways. Man likes to worship a god created by his own hands. He does not accept God's sovereignty in His creation. He does not like to acknowledge Him as the Creator.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God Assigning the Priesthood<br />to the Tribe of Levi</h2><p>While Moses was on the mount, God told him to go down. Moses turned and went down with the two tablets of testimony, the Ten Commandments, in his hands. As he drew near to the camp and saw the condition of the people, his wrath waxed hot and he cast down the two tablets. Standing at the gate of the camp he said, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me" (v. 26). All the sons of Levi gathered around him. He said to them, "Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor" (v. 27). Regardless of whom they saw, they had to kill them all. Because the people had worshipped the idol, the golden calf, those who were faithful had to draw their sword and slay them, no matter what kind of relationship they had with them.</p><p>Many people think that this order was too cruel. Who can slay his own brother? Who has the heart to kill his own friends? Eleven of the twelve tribes did not move. They felt that the cost was too high. As a result, only the tribe of Levi drew their swords, went to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slew about three thousand men on that day. Those slain were the brothers, relatives, and friends of the Levites.</p><p>Let us consider this a little. After the incident of the golden calf, God immediately told Moses that from that time on the nation of Israel could no longer be a kingdom of priests. Although nothing was said explicitly to that effect, God had reassigned the priesthood to the tribe of Levi alone. The priesthood was originally for the whole nation of Israel. Now, the priesthood was limited to the house of Aaron of the tribe of Levi.</p><h2 class="head2">D. God's People and God's Priests<br />Becoming Two Separate Groups</h2><p>From that time on, there were always two groups of people in the nation of Israel. One group were God's people and the other were God's priests. God's original intention was for all His people to be His priests. God had no intention of separating His people from His priests. He wanted the whole nation to be a kingdom of priests. God's people and God's priests should have been one. Whoever were God's people should have been His priests. As long as a person was one of God's people, he should have been God's priest. To be His people meant to be His priests. All His people were to be His priests. However, many loved the world and succumbed to human affection and turned away from faithfulness to worship the idol. As a result, God's people and His priests became two separate groups. Henceforth, if a man did not love the Lord more than his father, mother, wife, children, brother, sister, and all, he became unfit to be a disciple of the Lord. Many could not meet this requirement or pay this price. From that day forward, the nation of Israel was divided into two groups&mdash;God's people and His priests.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Priesthood<br />Becoming the Privilege of a Household</h2><p>From that day forward, the kingdom of priests became a tribe of priests. The scope of the priesthood was reduced from a kingdom of priests to a household of priests. The priesthood became the matter of a household instead of a nation. God's people and God's priests were one and the same in the tribe of Levi; that is, His people were His priests. In regards to the other eleven tribes, God's people were only God's people; they could no longer be God's priests. This was most serious. It is serious for a person to be a believer, one of God's people, and yet not be a priest.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRIESTHOOD&mdash;<br />BEING A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</h2><p>From Exodus until the time of the Lord Jesus on earth, no other tribe could function as priests except the tribe of Levi. They could not offer sacrifices to God. Their sacrifices had to be made through the priests. They could not even come to God to confess their sins; they had to confess them through the priests. They could not separate themselves from the world because they had no authority to touch the anointing oil. The priests alone could anoint and sanctify a person. All the spiritual services had to be carried out by the priests on their behalf.</p><p>One special characteristic about the Israelites in the Old Testament was that God was far away from them. Not everyone could contact Him. In the Old Testament we find the evolution of the priesthood, which I call an intermediary class. Man could not go to God directly. God's people had to go through the priests before they could draw near to God. They could not commune with God directly. God came to man through the priests, and man also went to God through the priests. Between God and man, there was a mediatorial class. Man could not come directly to God, and God could not come directly to man. Between God and man there was a mediatorial class.</p><p>This class was not found in God's original design. God's original intention was to approach His people directly and for them to come to Him directly. But now there were three parties. The people had to come to God through the priests, and God had to approach His people through the priests. God and man could no longer commune with each other directly. All contact became indirect.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CHANGE IN THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>For about fifteen hundred years, from the time of Moses to the time of Christ, God's people were unable to come directly to God. Only one household was qualified to be the priests. A man had to belong to this household to come to God. If he drew near to God directly, he would die. During that period, the ministry of the priests became a very powerful ministry. Man could not come to God directly; he needed the intercession of the priests. How noble and great the priestly ministry was! There was no way for man to come to God without the priests. But with the coming of the New Testament age, we find salvation and redemption reaching all men. Now we hear the word: "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:5).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Every Redeemed One Being a Priest<br />in the New Testament Dispensation</h2><p>In 1 Peter 2:4-7 Peter tells us that Christ is the foundation of the church. He was the stone rejected by the builders who has now become the head of the corner. We have become the living stones and are joined and built up to become a spiritual house. We also have become a holy priesthood to God. It is as if a voice from heaven burst forth announcing, "All who are saved are now God's priests. All the living stones, those who are part of the spiritual house, are now priests of God."</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Church Recovering<br />the Universal Priesthood Again</h2><p>Right then a promise which had been set aside for fifteen hundred years was recovered by God. What the Israelites lost has been recovered by the church. The universal priesthood was lost to Israel. In the New Testament age, it is as if a voice from heaven bursts forth with the promise that the universal priesthood is with us once more. All the saved ones are called to be priests.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Church Being a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father." Originally, the whole nation of Israel were priests. Later, this changed. But what about today? Today the church is a kingdom of priests. What the Israelites lost in the presence of the golden calf, the church has fully regained through the Lord Jesus. Today the entire church has become priests. God's ordained kingdom of priests has now been fully restored.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Unique Occupation of a Christian&mdash;<br />Serving God</h2><p>What God could not secure among the Israelites, He is now securing through the church. The church today is the kingdom of priests. The church is a priesthood. What does this mean? It means that everyone who has tasted God's grace has only one occupation left, that of serving God. I have said this before to the young people: If a person is a doctor before he believes in the Lord, his occupation is medicine; if he is a nurse, his occupation is nursing; if he is a teacher, his occupation is teaching; if he is a farmer, his occupation is farming; if he is a businessman, his occupation is business. But the moment one becomes a Christian, his occupation completely changes. Every Christian has only one occupation&mdash;serving God. From the time we were saved, we became priests to God. Henceforth, we have to serve God in His presence. This is our lifelong spiritual goal.</p><p>Every Christian has only one occupation, that of serving God. A Christian doctor can no longer expect to make a name for himself as a famous doctor; his practice as a doctor is only useful in sustaining his living. His real occupation is to be a priest to God. A professor or a teacher can no longer strive to be a famous or outstanding academician. Rather, he must now strive to be a proper priest before God. His teaching becomes merely his vocation; his main occupation is to serve God. Craftsmen, businessmen, farmers, and all the other professionals are no longer living for their own professions. There is now only one profession for everyone, that of serving God.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Only One Ambition&mdash;Pleasing the Lord</h2><p>Every brother and sister should set aside their old occupation on the day they are saved. I hope that you will give up all your ambitions and aspirations the day you begin your Christian life. You should no longer aspire to be someone special. You should no longer strive to be someone outstanding or distinguished in your field or line of occupation. You should learn from Paul, who had only one ambition&mdash;to be well pleasing to the Lord. You should not have any ambition other than this. All worldly occupations should be put aside. You should no longer have any aspiration to be great or outstanding. You should only aspire to serve the Lord in His presence.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE GLORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>During the early years of my Christian life, I always felt that it was a hard job to exhort young believers to serve God. It seemed that I had to try very hard to beckon, beg, and plead with others to serve God. But God's view is totally different from ours. God took the priesthood away from the Israelites when they sinned. In God's eyes service is a great privilege and a high honor. If a man fails or backslides, God takes away the priesthood from him. God has no intention to persuade or beg man to serve Him. He has no intention of seeking man's approval. It is man's glory, not God's, for him to be called to be God's priest.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God Honoring Us by Calling Us to the Priesthood</h2><p>Those who offered strange fire in the Old Testament were burned to death. Some died when they entered the holy place. Others died when they tried to offer sacrifices to God. God would not allow anyone except the priests to come to Him. In God's eyes the priesthood is a trust He has placed upon man. He is bestowing glory and honor to man and uplifting man when He calls him to the priesthood. A person would die if he volunteered to take up the priesthood according to his own will. Uzzah, who stretched out his own hand to steady the ark when it tilted, was immediately smitten to death.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Foolish Men Considering Service<br />to Be a Favor to God</h2><p>There are many people who think that they are granting God a favor by offering themselves to Him. Over the past decades, I have always felt uneasy when preachers pleaded with believers in revival meetings to give themselves to serve God. Many people give a little money to God and think that they are doing Him a special favor. Many people offer themselves to serve God and think that they are doing Him a favor. Some people think that they are bestowing honor upon God when they give up a little position in the world. Their hearts seem to be saying, "I give myself, someone as important as I, to serve God today!" Some give up their little positions and think that they are exalting the Lord. But this is blindness! This is nothing but folly and darkness!</p><h2 class="head2">C. Our Greatest Honor Being to Serve God</h2><p>If God in heaven has called us to be His priests, we should be on our knees before Him to receive His calling. This is our greatest honor. God has elevated us. We do not say that we can give anything to God. We say that our greatest honor lies in God's acceptance of what we offer to Him. What a tremendous honor that persons such as ourselves can serve God. This is pure grace! This surely is the gospel! It is not only a gospel about Jesus' salvation; it is a gospel that even persons such as ourselves can serve God. This is indeed the gospel, a great gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. UPHOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. There Being No Church<br />without the Universal Priesthood</h2><p>In the church today the priesthood is no longer restricted to only a few people; it has become a universal priesthood. The nation of Israel failed; the church cannot fail again. The nation of Israel failed in that God's people and God's priests became separated. May the Lord have mercy on us. May there be no separation between God's people and His priests in the church today. In the church God's people are His priests. All the people of God are priests of God. There must be as many priests as there are brothers and sisters. Everyone must come to God to offer up spiritual sacrifices and sacrifices of praise. Everyone should take part in spiritual service. This is not a selective ministry. Everyone should come to God to serve Him. A church that comes short of universal and direct access to God is not a church.</p><p>Please bear in mind that there is no church if the priesthood is not universal. The nation of Israel failed; the church should not fail again. During the past two thousand years, the scope of the priesthood has never been recovered to include all the people of God. The two thousand years of church history show us a frequent separation between the people and the ministry of the priests. An intermediary class has time and time again come between God and His people. This is the work and teaching of the Nicolaitans.</p><h2 class="head2">B. No Longer Tolerating the Intermediary Class</h2><p>We can no longer tolerate an intermediary class. We can no longer accept a hierarchy. We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class. We need to see what the church is. The church is the place where every child of God is a priest. We cannot have one person or a few persons monopolizing spiritual service. They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters. Such an intermediary class cannot exist in the church.</p><p>Our controversy with denominations is not a matter of outward forms but a matter of inward content. Today there is a hierarchy in the denominations&mdash;one group of people is serving God, while the rest are merely pew members. One group of people is serving God as a profession, while the rest of the pew members, though equally born to be God's children, need to approach Him through them. This hierarchical practice is tolerated by many organizations in Christianity today. But we cannot accept any intermediary class. We cannot set aside the grace given to the church in the New Testament. We cannot forsake it as the Israelites did.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Intermediary Class Abolished<br />When Everyone Serves</h2><p>We need to abolish the intermediary class. In order for us to abolish this class, we all have to become part of it. When all of us become a part of that class, the hierarchy is gone. How can we make the three groups two groups? How can we turn three-way traffic into two-way traffic? How can these three&mdash;God, the priesthood, and the people&mdash;become two? There is no other way except to kneel down before the Lord and say, "Lord, I am willing to serve You. I am willing to be a priest." When all of God's children become His priests, the three parties will be reduced to two.</p><p>Hierarchy comes from the world, the flesh, idol worship, and the love of the world. If all the brothers deny the world and reject idolatry from the beginning, they will all offer themselves up to God. They will say, "From this day forward, I will live on earth for the sole purpose of serving God." Then hierarchy will disappear spontaneously. If all the brothers realize that their sole occupation is to serve God and if all of them will serve God in coordination, the intermediary class will disappear!</p><h2 class="head2">D. One Needing to Be a Priest As Long As<br />One Is a Christian</h2><p>I hope you will not allow any intermediary class to come in. Uphold this from the very beginning. Only among the fallen and backslidden ones and among those who walk according to their own way could there be the resurgence of an intermediary class. Among those defeated ones, it is natural for some to serve the Lord and some not to serve the Lord. Those who do not serve the Lord attend to their own affairs, while those who serve the Lord take care of spiritual affairs. Those who do not serve the Lord, at most, offer some money to support those who serve. They may be businessmen, teachers, or doctors, but they all attend to their own affairs and walk their own way. They do not seem to have anything to do with God's service. In this kind of setting, what does a person need to do to qualify to be a good Christian? He only needs to set aside a little time every week to attend a worship service. If he has some money, he only needs to offer a small portion of it. But this clearly makes God's people and His priests two classes of people! Today we should realize that either we are not Christians at all or we have to be those who consecrate everything to the Lord. As long as we are Christians, we have to be priests to God.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE RECOVERY OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. There Being No Problem in the Early Churches</h2><p>The danger that haunted the nation of Israel is the same problem that has confronted the church over the past two thousand years. From the time of the Lord's departure until the time of the writing of Revelation and a little beyond that point, all of God's children were priests. Everyone who considered himself a child of God was a priest of God. There was no problem then. There was no problem from the first century up through the third century. Individually, there were isolated problems here and there, but as a whole there was no problem. Here and there some of God's children refused to be priests, but as a whole we did not see any problem. As long as a person was a child of God, he was a priest of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Church's Nature Being Changed after<br />the Roman Empire's Acceptance of Christianity</h2><p>When the Roman Empire endorsed Christianity, many people began to creep in. There were material benefits in believing in the Lord; one became a fellow believer of the emperor and a brother of Caesar. Originally, the Lord's charge was, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" (Matt. 22:21). Now both the things of Caesar and the things of God were rendered to God. This indeed was a big victory for Christianity. Constantine was converted to Christ. The result was a gradual but significant shift for the church. Believers were no longer the same as those who professed their faith at an earlier age. During the ten periods of persecution under the reign of Rome, tens of thousands of Christians suffered martyrdom. It was not easy to pretend to be a Christian. But then the situation totally changed. It became fashionable to be a believer and to share the same faith as the emperor and to call him one's brother. When this shift occurred, many decided to join Christianity. As a result, the number of people increased, while the number of priests remained the same. It is easy to creep into the Christian fold, but it is absolutely impossible to creep into God's service.</p><h2 class="head2">C. A Separation between the Spiritual Ones<br />and the Worldly Ones</h2><p>The church witnessed a drastic change in the fourth century. During that period, many who joined the church were either unbelievers or half believers. They appeared to be believers, yet they held worldly power in their hands. They had no desire to serve the Lord in the church. At the most they were saved, but they could not serve the Lord. Spontaneously, some spiritual ones rose up to take care of the affairs of the church. The others then said, "You do it! Go and serve the Lord. We are the secular ones." The word secular was introduced in the fourth century. Some would attend to earthly affairs, while others would attend to spiritual work. As a result many served God, but many more no longer served.</p><p>At the time of the apostles in the first century, every believer served the Lord. From the fourth century on, men began to say, "We are merely God's people. We attend to our own affairs in the world and keep our positions in society. Once in a while, we give a little money. This should qualify us as Christians. Let the spiritual ones take care of the spiritual things for us." From that time forward, the church followed the footsteps of the nation of Israel; it worshipped "the golden calf" and created an intermediary class. No longer were all of God's people priests. Some became merely His people but not His priests.</p><p>Today, clergymen in the Roman Catholic Church are called priests. In China they are known as fathers. These so-called fathers are actually called priests. Some state churches follow the example of the Roman Catholic Church and give their pastors the title of priests. Those who tend to earthly affairs are called God's people, while those who manage spiritual things are called priests. The church has been divided into priests and people.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Lord Taking the Way of Recovery</h2><p>There is something I would like all of us to see: In this end time, God is doing a work of recovery; He is taking the way of recovery. I believe God is leading all of His children up to this position in this last age. Here is one segment of the pathway of the church that is waiting for a fundamental recovery&mdash;the universal priesthood of God's children. As long as a person is one of God's people, he should be a priest. There are priests today. In the kingdom to come, there also will be priests. God wants to secure His priests. He wants all of His people to be His priests.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTS</h2><p>As soon as you become a Christian, you become a priest. If you want to be a Christian, you have to be a priest. Do not expect anyone to be a priest for you. You have to be a priest yourself. There is no intermediary class among us. No one will attend to spiritual affairs for us. No one will work for us. Among us we must not have another class of people called workers.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Need for the Whole Church to Serve</h2><p>If God is merciful to us, all the brothers and sisters will spontaneously be working, preaching the gospel, and serving the Lord together. The more universal the priesthood is, the more visible the church will be. Once the priesthood becomes non-universal, we have failed and our pathway has been corrupted.</p><h2 class="head2">B. God Honoring Us by Allowing Us to Serve Him</h2><p>We are poor, weak, blind, and crippled. For the Lord to accept persons such as ourselves to be priests is an honor to us. In the Old Testament, such people could not be priests. All who were disabled, lame, or blemished could not be priests. However, today the base, the unclean, the blind, and the disabled have all been called by God to be priests! He is the Lord. I have said this before: We should gladly give ourselves to His service even if it means crawling to His feet to beg for service. We should be happy to kneel down to beg for this honor. I am happy to crawl on my knees and plead with the Lord, "Lord, I want to serve You. I gladly offer myself to Your service. You honor me by allowing me to come to You." To be a priest is to draw near to God. To be a priest is to have no distance between us and God; it is to be able to enter in directly and to wait for no one. To be a priest means that we can touch God ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God's Kingdom Realized<br />When Everyone Serves</h2><p>If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us. It will be a kingdom of priests; all the people will be priests. This is glorious. I look forward to the day when all idols are removed from among us. Before the Lord, we should pay whatever price it takes to achieve this. The Levites paid the price; they were faithful in setting aside their personal affection. Only such people can have a share in the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Basis of the Priesthood&mdash;<br />God's Acceptance</h2><p>In order to fully understand the priesthood, we need to understand the way God dealt with the priests in the Old Testament. It is a great matter for God to allow a person to draw near to Him without being smitten. Only the priests could eat the showbread, serve at the altar, and enter the holy place. Only they could offer the sacrifices. Others died when they entered the holy place. God's acceptance is the basis of the priesthood. Since God has accepted us, should we not enter in today? Formerly, anyone would die if he dared to enter in. But today God says, "You can come!" How strange it is if we still feel reluctant to come.</p><h2 class="head2">E. God's Mercy Enabling Us<br />to Serve in Grace</h2><p>We need the Lord to open our eyes. It is grace in its highest form for a person to be given the privilege to serve Him. Those who really know God will say, "The grace that allows me to serve God is greater than the grace which brought me to salvation." The dog under the table can eat the crumbs underneath the table, but it cannot serve at the table. To be saved by grace is relatively simple, but not everyone can serve by grace. Today in the church, everyone who is saved by grace can also serve. It is foolish not to consider this to be a great grace.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Rejecting the Principle<br />of Having an Intermediary Class</h2><p>Today's Christianity acknowledges the presence of an intermediary class. Christianity as we see it today even divides God's priests and God's people into two classes. We look forward to the day when there is no more hierarchy among us. There may be one or two persons in the church who have failed. But the principle does not change. Today it is fashionable in Christianity to compromise principles. In principle, today's Christianity has fallen and has taken the way of the Israelites&mdash;the people and the priests have become two. May we not fall into such a system!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:23; 4:11-13; 5:29-30; Gen. 2:21-24; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 12:12-30; Rom. 12:4-8</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST</h2><p>Genesis 2 shows us that God took a rib from Adam and made Eve out of it. This typifies the relationship between Christ and the church. Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church comes out of Christ. God made Eve out of Adam. Likewise, He created the church out of Christ. God gave us not only the grace, power, and nature of Christ, but He also gave us the Body of Christ. God has given us His bones, His flesh, and Himself, even as He gave Adam's rib to Eve. What then is the church? The church comes out of Christ. The Bible shows us that Christ is the Head of the church and the church is the Body of Christ. Individually speaking, every Christian is a member of the Body of Christ and comes out of Christ.</p><p>There is one thing we must take note of: The Body of Christ is on earth, but it is not earthly. It is heavenly, yet it is on earth. When Saul was persecuting the church, on his way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus asked him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" (Acts 9:4). The Lord's word was quite strange. He did not say, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My disciples," but "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" He did not say, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My church," but "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" This showed Paul that the church and Christ are one. The church is one with Christ, so much so that when a man persecutes the church he is persecuting Christ. This shows us also that the Body of Christ is on earth, because no one could persecute it if it were in heaven. The Body of Christ is on earth. Therefore, Paul could persecute it. Because the Body of Christ is the church on earth, Paul's persecuting of the church was his persecuting of the Lord Himself. Many people say that the manifestation of the Body of Christ is something that will occur in heaven. They say that one has to wait until he is in heaven before he can see the manifestation of the Body. If this were the case, Paul's persecution of the church could not have been considered as his persecution of the Lord. The Lord said that Saul persecuted Him when he persecuted the church. Therefore, the Body of Christ is manifested on earth, not in heaven. The church as the Body of Christ is on earth. We have to express this Body while we are on earth. Although the Head is in heaven, the Body and the Head are one. The Body on earth and the Head in heaven are one. To persecute the Body is to persecute the Head. To persecute the church is to persecute the Lord. The two are one, and there is no way to separate them.</p><p>Some may ask, "How could the Body of Christ be expressed on earth during Paul's time? From the time Paul was on earth until now, one thousand nine hundred years have passed. Every year countless numbers of people throughout the world are saved and added to the Body of Christ. Many more will be added in the coming days and years. How could the church at Paul's time be called the Body of Christ?" One brother in the last century gave a good answer. He said that the church is like a bird. When it first hatched, the feathers were not well developed. Yet we can say that it was a bird. When it becomes full grown, we still say that it is a bird. Feathers from elsewhere are not added to the bird; they grow from the bird itself. The growth and maturity of the bird are the result of the inward activities of the bird's life. This is how the church grows on earth today. Although Paul persecuted the church in its infancy, it was nevertheless the Body of Christ. From that time on until today, nothing has been added to it; it has only become more full grown.</p><p>Although the church on earth today is still very small in size, it is nevertheless perfect within. The growth of the church issues from within itself. It grows out of Christ. The church on earth today is the Body of Christ. Apparently, saved ones are being added to the church. But as far as its spiritual reality is concerned, no one has ever joined the church. The Body of Christ grows by itself from within. It grows continually out of the Head. The church is simply the extension of the Body of Christ on earth. The church dwells on earth but comes out of the heavenly Head. At the same time, it is a Body in oneness with the Head.</p><p>We must be clear about what the church is in the eyes of God. The church is the Body of Christ. Therefore, anything smaller than the Body cannot be the basis for the formation of a church. We cannot establish a church based on doctrines, systems, or rituals. Neither can we establish a church based on the name of a founder or a place of origin. All these are smaller than the Body of Christ. If we want to start a church in a locality, we must learn to stand on the ground of the Body. We must welcome and accept all the members who have fellowship in the Body of Christ. Whoever is in the Body and of the Body is a brother or sister in the church. If we stand in the position of the Body of Christ, our number may be small, but we will still have a proper basis for forming the church. However, if we do not stand on the position of the Body of Christ, we will have no basis to form any church, even though our number may be very great.</p><p>Once a church which takes the Body of Christ as its basis is established in a locality, no one should separate himself to set up another church under the pretense of differences in doctrines, views, or opinions. The basis of the church is the Body of Christ. The desire to uphold a certain doctrine is not a justifiable basis for forming a church. If the basis of the first "church" is not the Body of Christ, one can, of course, set up a church that is based on the Body of Christ. But if the basis of the first church is indeed the Body of Christ, we must fellowship with it. We cannot walk away and form another "church" of our own.</p><p>A local church should include all the children of God in that locality. The church takes the Body of Christ as its basic unit. If other brothers and sisters will not come, that is their own concern. But the church should not impose any condition upon anyone other than the need to acknowledge the Body. The Body is the only condition for forming a church. A church cannot be smaller than the Body of Christ. In other words, whoever is of Christ should be in the church; whoever is in the Body of Christ may not be rejected.</p><p>However, to accept anyone who is not in the Body of Christ or to embrace unbelievers is to go beyond the Body of Christ. That would no longer be the church of Christ; it would be an organization of confusion. In conclusion, whatever falls short of the Body of Christ or goes beyond the Body of Christ is not the church.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH BEING ONE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</p><p>We have seen that the church comes out of Christ. Now we want to see how the church is one in the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The church comes out of Christ. This speaks of its origin. Every Christian possesses a new life. The one life of Christ has become millions of Christians. John 12 speaks of a grain of wheat which falls into the ground and dies and bears much fruit. All the grains which are produced from the one grain have the same essence as the original grain. One grain has become many grains, and the many grains come out of that one grain. How then can the many Christians who possess the same life become the one Body of Christ? This is where the work of the Holy Spirit comes in. The one Christ has become millions of Christians. Now the Holy Spirit baptizes these millions of Christians into one Body. This is the fundamental teaching recorded in 1 Corinthians 12:12-13. The Body is one, yet it is composed of many members. How can the many members become one Body? "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." In other words, this Body comes into being through baptism. Through baptism in the Spirit, the many Christians are immersed into one Body. Every Christian is like a piece of stone hewn out of a big rock. The Holy Spirit is like the cement which cements the stones back together to become one rock.</p><p>The Body of Christ has two basic principles: First, apart from that which comes out of Christ, there is no Body of Christ; second, apart from the operation of the Holy Spirit, there is no Body of Christ. There must first be the baptism of the Spirit and the infilling of the Spirit; God's children must all be baptized by the Spirit in order to become the Body. This was what happened at Pentecost in Acts 2. Many had received the Lord's life and had become His many members. Then the Lord baptized these many members through the Holy Spirit into one Body. Those who know the Lord and the Holy Spirit also will know this one Body. There are many members in the human body, but the head rules over them all through the nerves. Likewise, the Head of the church joins the many members into one Body through the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The church is out of Christ, and it is formed into one Body in the Holy Spirit. Christian fellowship and communion should be based on one's standing in the Body of Christ. We have no relationship other than this relationship. We are not bound together because we are Jews or Greeks. We commune with one another because we are all members of the Body of Christ. Our communion with one another is based on the Body.</p><p>There is only one basis for our fellowship in the church&mdash;our being fellow members with one another in the Body. We cannot have any fellowship that is based on any other foundation. Any fellowship outside the Body of Christ is a division. Any fellowship that is not as large as the Body, that is in fact smaller than the Body, is not the fellowship of the Body. Any boundary that is different from the boundary of the Body, though it may not contradict the boundary of the Body, is a hindrance to the Body boundary. Such a variation in boundary will always hinder the fellowship of the Body. We cannot accept any fellowship that is different from the Body. We are here to maintain the fellowship of Christians, the fellowship of the Body, not any fellowship that is smaller than the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SERVICE IN THE BODY</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:14-21 says, "For the body is not one member but many. If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body....If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed. And if all were one member, where would the body be? But now the members are many, but the body one. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you." Verses 28 through 30 go on to say, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power? Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret tongues?"</p><p>There are many members in the Body of Christ, and the Holy Spirit dispenses all kinds of gifts and ministries to them according to the need of the Body. The Lord grants the members different kinds of gifts and ministries for the purpose of supplying the need of the whole Body. The Lord knows that He will not make the whole Body the eyes or the whole Body the ears. The Lord gives the members different gifts and ministries to supply the whole Body. As the human body needs all the members, so the church needs the different kinds of gifts and ministries for its spiritual service. Some serve in the ministry of the word. Some serve by performing works of power. Some exercise the gift of healing. Some render helps. Some speak in tongues and some interpret tongues, etc. The church must provide ample opportunity for all the brothers and sisters to serve. All the members, including the uncomely ones, are useful in the ministry of the Spirit. It is impossible to have a useless member in the Body. Every brother and sister is a member in the Body and every member has his or her function and service. As long as you are a Christian, you are a member of the Body of Christ, and as a member in the Body, you must have your own service before God. We must honor such a practice of universal service. Every Christian must have his or her respective function and must serve the Lord according to this function.</p><p>Every member in the church should find a place to serve. Everyone should serve and there should not be any monopoly. A member or a few members should not replace all the members in doing everything. Any system that does not provide opportunity for all the members to function is surely not of the Body. In the physical body, the eyes, the mouth, the feet, and the hands may all be very busy. Yet they do not contradict each other. Something is wrong if only the eyes function while the mouth, feet, and hands do not. If the eyes, mouth, feet, and hands all function together and coordinate as one entity, we have the body. If some serve and others do not or if only one or a few serve, we do not have the Body of Christ. We must be very clear about this principle.</p><p>Romans 12:4-8 says, "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us be faithful in that service; or he who teaches, in that teaching; or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness."</p><p>Another matter which requires special attention in the Body is that both the grace and the gift that everyone receives are different. The passage in 1 Corinthians 12 emphasizes the ministry of the word and the miraculous gifts. The passage in Romans 12, in addition to speaking of the ministry of the word, includes ministries of other services in the church as well. Some give, some lead, and some show mercy. All these can be considered works of the Levites. They are services that pertain to practical affairs.</p><p>Romans 12 shows us that everyone who is gifted must function according to the gift which God has given him, whether it is in the ministry of the word or in the ministry of service. He who prophesies, let him prophesy. He who serves, let him serve. He who teaches, let him teach. He who exhorts, let him exhort. He who leads, let him lead diligently in the church. In other words, everyone should serve. Everyone should have his or her specific service and should be faithful to this function. Everyone should know what he can do before God and what gift he has received from the Lord. This knowledge should direct him to function in a specific way. No one should go beyond his own function to take over the service of others. No member should take the place of another member, and no member should relinquish his own function. All should serve together, and everyone should fully apply himself to his own work. In this way the Body of Christ will be expressed.</p><p>The Body cannot allow one member to neglect his duty. The whole Body is in darkness if the eyes do not see. The whole Body cannot walk if the feet refuse to walk. The eyes should see and the feet should walk. Even though the gift that you have received from God may be small, you should not hide your gift. Even if the gift you have received from God is just one talent (Matt. 25:14-30), you should not keep it or neglect it. Whether one's gift is big or small, whether it is "five talents," "two talents," or "one talent," he should exercise what he has and serve accordingly. If he refuses to give himself to his service and instead buries his "one talent," the church will suffer. If a few members in the Body refuse to function, the Body will suffer great loss.</p><p>It is not easy to find five-talented ones in the church. Yet every child of God, no matter how small his gift may be, has at least one talent. If all the one-talented ones will rise up to serve, they will be more effective than the few who have five talents. If all the one-talented ones will rise up to serve, the church will surely flourish. All those with one talent should rise up to serve. Whether or not the church will prosper depends on whether the one-talented ones will rise up to serve. If only a few people are laboring and working, we do not have the church. If all the brothers and sisters are working and laboring, it will be the church serving and the Body functioning. A few members no longer will take over the function of the whole Body. We hope everyone who has "one talent" will dig out his talent from the earth. Everyone who has the "mina" should realize that the handkerchief is for wiping sweat, not for wrapping up his mina (Luke 19:20). We must learn to serve according to our ability. When everyone rises up to serve and no one passes his responsibility to someone else, we have the church.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, "He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</p><p>The kinds of people spoken of here are slightly different from those spoken of in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. The people here are all ministers of the word. God's intention in giving the church these ministers of the word is for the building up of the Body of Christ. The ministers of the word have a special place in the building up of the Body of Christ. For the building up of the Body of Christ, we should ask God for more ministers of the word.</p><p>At the same time, the church should provide ample opportunities for new believers to manifest themselves, to see whether they are ministers of the word. We should not hinder the gifts that God has given them. We should not take away their opportunity to manifest themselves as ministers of the word. For the Body of Christ to be built up, the church must ask God for more ministers of the word. It must also provide ample opportunities for each one to manifest himself as a minister of the word.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:16-17 says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</p><p>The church is the Body of Christ. Therefore, its mission on earth is to express this Body and to manifest the oneness of this Body. It should show everyone that the Body is one. The church does not need to wait until it is in heaven before expressing the oneness of the Body. It expresses the oneness of the Body while it is here on earth.</p><p>"Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body." In the New Testament the breaking of bread is a very important matter. Whenever we come on the Lord's Day to break bread and remember the Lord, we acknowledge that the Lord has broken His body for us. We also express that the Body is one. The breaking of bread signifies the Lord's giving of Himself in love on the cross for us; the oneness speaks of the union among God's children. Every Lord's Day we come to the Lord to acknowledge that His body was broken for us and that all of God's children are one. On the one hand, we testify that the Lord's body was broken for us. On the other hand, we testify that the church is the Body of Christ and that this Body is one. We who are many are one bread and one Body. We express this oneness. Whoever understands the Body of Christ renders this testimony on the Lord's Day. On this day he testifies that there is only one bread. In the eyes of God, this bread is the center of all the meetings. God's children should gather together for the purpose of breaking bread and fellowshipping with one another. The more one understands the Body of Christ, the more he will testify of the oneness of the Body through the breaking of bread. The breaking of bread is a remembrance of the Lord's death, and it is an expression of the oneness of the Body. "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body." We do this to show the world, the universe, and the whole creation that the church is one Body!</p><p>May the Lord be gracious to us, and may He show us clearly that the basis for forming the church is the Body of Christ. We are members one of another in the Body. Through the baptism of the Spirit, we are constituted as one Body. Thus our fellowship should be based only on the Body of Christ. In the Body every member has its function and every member should serve. We should ask God for more ministers of the word on behalf of the church, ministers who will perfect the saints to the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ. We should also express the testimony of the oneness of this Body through the breaking of bread. May God bless all of us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</h1><p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of the authority of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD APPOINTING AUTHORITY<br />AS THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE<br />FOR HIS RULE OVER THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>When God created the universe, He ordained authority as the governing principle for His rule over it. He alone is the highest authority. He is also the origin of all authorities. Some archangels were under Him, and under these archangels were many other angels. The record in Jeremiah and Isaiah shows us that there were other living creatures on earth during that time. This was God's original order of administration over the universe. Not only was man upheld by His authority, but even the stars in the universe, including the earth and all the living creatures, were upheld by His authority. God established natural laws through His word of authority over every living creature and every natural element. Authority is crucial to the universe. If any object or creature acts contrary to God's ordained laws, the whole universe will be thrown into confusion.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE HISTORY OF REBELLION IN THE UNIVERSE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Rebellion of the Archangel</h2><p>What happened after God's creation? We know that the previous world became fallen when Satan, the archangel appointed by God, tried to exalt himself.</p><p>He said in his heart, "I will ascend to heaven;/...I will exalt my throne./...I will be like the Most High" (Isa. 14:13-14). Satan's rebellion was not against other things but against authority. He wanted to be equal with God. He wanted to exalt himself to be God. He did not think that being the lord over everything under God was enough. He rebelled against God's authority and tried to usurp His authority. As a result, the morning star became Satan; the angel of light became the devil. This happened before the creation of man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The First Rebellion of Man</h2><h2 class="head3">1. God's Ordination for Man</h2><p>God placed man in the garden of Eden after his creation. He arranged everything and appointed authorities in the world. He created man first, and then the woman. He created the husband first, and then the wife. God's intention was for Eve to submit to Adam and for Adam to submit to Him. In this arrangement He laid the foundation for children to obey their parents, slaves to obey their masters, and citizens to obey their rulers and kings. God arranged things in a definite way. He established authority in the universe.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Satan's Temptation and Corruption</h2><p>Then Satan came in and tempted man in the garden of Eden. Through temptation Satan induced man not only to sin but also to overthrow God's appointed authority. God ordained for the woman to obey the man. But in the garden of Eden the man followed the woman. God appointed Adam to be the head, but in the garden of Eden, Eve took the lead. She taught and made decisions and suggestions. The rest of mankind was not yet born; only Adam and Eve were there. The only rule was that the woman should submit to the man. The wife should submit to the husband. But this unique arrangement was immediately broken because of Satan.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Man's Fall and Rebellion</h2><p>Though only two persons rebelled in this catastrophe, it was in effect a rebellion of the whole world. Not only was the authority of man over man overthrown, but even the authority of God over man was overthrown. Satan said that in the day they ate thereof, they would be as God, and that God had forbidden them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that they would not become as Him. There were two rebellions: One was man's rebellion against God's appointed authority among men. The other was man's rebellion against God's own authority. In other words, God's direct authority was overturned, and His deputy authority was overturned as well. Man did not submit to God. He thought he could become God by doing what he did. God's authority was overthrown in this way. Man wanted to be God himself; he wanted to overthrow God's authority.</p><p>Eve should have submitted to Adam. She should have consulted with Adam about everything, but she did not check with him. Instead, she considered and made the decision. She took the lead to sin. Please bear in mind that independence in thought is the first step toward sin. If a man refuses to learn from God's appointed deputy authority and if he never presents things to God but cultivates his own independent thought, considering only what is pleasant to the eyes, what is good for food, and what is desirous to make one wise, he is rebelling not only against God but also against His appointed authority on the earth. The single act of transgression in the garden of Eden overthrew two authorities at the same time: God's deputy authority and His direct authority.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Man Following Satan to Live in Disobedience</h2><p>The story in the garden of Eden was a repetition of Satan's history. Satan wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God. He also tempted man to uplift himself to be equal with God. In the first paradise, the bright cherub rebelled. In the second paradise, man rebelled. Since that day man has been walking in the way of disobedience. Romans 5 says that through one offense, condemnation came to all men (v. 18), and through the disobedience of one man, the many were constituted sinners (v. 19). Please bear in mind that in God's eyes, what happened in the garden of Eden was not only an offense but an act of disobedience. Do not think that there was only sin in the garden of Eden; there was disobedience as well. Sin entered the world through the disobedience of one man. Since that day, man has been living under the principle of disobedience.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Rebellion of Mankind after the Flood</h2><h2 class="head3">1. God's Arrangement for Human Government<br />after the Flood</h2><p>At the time of the flood, God appointed men to be rulers. This was the beginning of human government. From the time of Adam to the time of the flood, there were families, not government. Government was instituted 1,656 years after the creation. After the emergence of government, we find authority resting not only with the family but also with government. "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (Gen. 9:6). This was the beginning of government.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Rebellion of the Nations</h2><p>After the flood, Ham rebelled against his father's authority (Gen. 9:20-27). Then God established the nations. But the people of the nations united together and built the tower of Babel for themselves. Though they did not rebel against each other, they united to rebel against God. In the garden the individual and the family rebelled against God. But at the tower of Babel, the nations rebelled against Him. Man's intention was to build a tower to go to heaven and to climb to the top to stand in God's place. God prepared stones on earth. But man prepared bricks as a counterfeit of God's stones. Mankind prepared bricks and built a tower for itself. Man tried to be like God. After the flood, the nations united to rebel against God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Rebellion of the Israelites</h2><h2 class="head3">1. God Choosing Abraham<br />to Be a Pattern of Submission</h2><p>God chose Abraham not only to be the father of faith but also to be a pattern of submission. In the midst of the rebellion of the nations and the confusion of the tower of Babel, God chose Abraham not only for his faith but also for his submission. God demands, expects, and desires to find a man of submission. He desires to find a man who will stand on the ground of submission in the day of rebellion.</p><p>Not only was Abraham a man of submission, even his wife was in submission. Not only were Abraham and Sarah submissive to God, Sarah was submissive to Abraham as well. Sarah submitted to God and accepted His direct authority. She also accepted Abraham as her deputy authority. Both the husband and the wife were submissive to God, and between the husband and wife, that is, between one human being and another human being, there was also submission. They maintained the principle of God's authority on earth. As a result, God's people came out of them. God's people were chosen based upon His authority.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God Establishing Authority<br />among the Israelites</h2><p>God told Abraham that his descendants would become slaves in Egypt, but that He would bring them out by the fourth generation. In the exodus from Egypt, Moses brought the Israelites out. First, God gained one man, Moses, who was submissive. After Moses learned authority, God commissioned him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Among the Israelites, God established His direct authority. We see this in Exodus, when God's presence was manifested by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. The Lord also expressed His authority through the commandments. He also appointed Moses and Aaron to be His authority. Moses and Aaron were God's appointed authority, His deputy authority, among the Israelites.</p><h2 class="head3">3. God Not Tolerating<br />Those Who Offend His Authority</h2><p>God would not tolerate men's sinning against Himself, and He would not tolerate men's sinning against His servants. Not only did God forbid men to sin against Himself, but He also forbade men to sin against His priests and prophets. God appointed authority among the children of Israel, and when they offended His authority, judgments and punishments would come upon them. Those who offended His authority were not allowed to enter the land of Canaan.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Rebellion of the Israelites<br />throughout History</h2><p>After they entered the land of Canaan, the Israelites again flagrantly rebelled against God. They wanted to have a king among them. They did not want God to rule over them; they wanted to follow the way of the world to have a king among them. God said to Samuel, "It is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me" (1 Sam. 8:7). Saul was chosen, and he was followed by David. God appointed David to be the authority, and through his hands gathered the materials for the building of the temple, a place for His dwelling among His people. At the time of Solomon, the temple was built.</p><p>Immediately after Solomon's death, the Israelites turned to idols. From that day forward, the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah were forsaken. Although God tolerated them for many years and allowed them to keep their kings, it was only His promise to David that kept the nation of Israel, not His desire for keeping it. Nothing offends God more than idolatry. Idolatry usurps the worship of God. From that point forward, the history of Israel became nothing but a history of rebellion.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE LORD JESUS ESTABLISHING<br />THE PATTERN OF SUBMISSION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Lord Jesus Being<br />the Perfect Submissive One</h2><p>When Jesus of Nazareth appeared, He was God's chosen One on earth. He said that He spoke only what He heard and that He could do nothing from Himself except what He saw the Father doing (John 5:19). He did not seek His own will but the will of the One who sent Him (v. 30). Here was a man who would not speak or act by Himself. He submitted fully to God's authority.</p><p>The Lord Jesus is God Himself. Yet He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself fully under God's authority. After His death on the cross, God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him to be the Lord and Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:5-11).</p><p>The Lord formed His church after His ascension. He did not establish His church in the way that men establish a society or an organization. The resurrected and ascended Lord is now the Head of the church. The church is His Body. In other words, He wants to manifest the submissive life which He lived on earth through the church today.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Gospel Being<br />a Commandment for Submission</h2><p>The gospel constitutes a commandment in the Bible. The Bible shows us that after one hears the gospel, he should believe. But at the time he believes the gospel, he should also submit to the gospel. The Holy Spirit is given to those who obey God (Acts 5:32). We are people who have obeyed from our hearts the word which was preached to us (Rom. 6:17). Please bear in mind that the receiving of the Lord Jesus and our faith and salvation in Him are related to obedience. This is God's commandment; He is charging men everywhere to believe in it. Therefore, to believe is to submit. A person should learn to submit to the Lord and to God's authority from the first day he enters the church.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Underlying Principle<br />of the Church Being Submission</h2><p>History throughout the ages shows that the whole world is in rebellion. The underlying principle of the world is an overthrow of either God's direct authority or His appointed authority. Today is the age when the Body of the Lord, that is, the church, is built on earth. The underlying principle of the church should be the principle of submission. God puts a high demand on the church; He wants to secure what He originally planned to secure in the world. Today in the church God puts a high stake on the woman; she must submit to the man. How difficult it is for God to secure such a thing in the world! If you ask a woman in the world today whether she is willing to submit to man, she will feel that such a demand makes no sense. Yet in the church today, God demands that the woman be submissive to the man, and the wife to the husband.</p><p>Ephesians and Colossians are lofty books, but what kind of commandments do we find in these Epistles? They tell us that wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters. This is not something that can be found in the world; it can be found only in the church.</p><p>Ephesians and Colossians touch the highest things. They show us that we were once sons of disobedience. Just like the world, our former principle of life was rebellion. We were called sons of disobedience. Today God has given us a commandment: Wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters. This is something different from the whole world. This shows us that submission is the basic principle of the church today.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Subject Also<br />to the Authority of the World</h2><p>We see an even clearer word in the book of Romans. Romans 13:1 says, "For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God." All authority is ordained by God. This verse and those that follow show us in particular that we should be subject not only to authorities but also to rulers. Render to them what is due: Tax to whom tax is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due (v. 7). No other book speaks about salvation as clearly as the book of Romans. Yet this same book tells us, beginning in Romans 12 on the matter of consecration to Romans 14, that we should be submissive not only in the church but also in the world. A man must submit to all the authorities over him.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. SUBMISSION BEING<br />A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church is a body of people. This body has one characteristic&mdash;submission. While we live on earth today, we take submission as our very nature and as the principle of our very living.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Church Being the Body<br />That Upholds the Authority of God</h2><p>Today the church should be strong enough to declare that it can offer to God what He failed to gain at the time of Adam. It should be able to offer to God what He could not gain from the world, from the nation of Israel, or from many tribes, peoples, nations, and tongues. In other words, there must be at least one place on this earth where God's authority is upheld. The church should lift up her eyes and say, "Lord, what You could not gain from Satan, You are gaining from us. What You could not gain from the devil and the rebellious angels, You are gaining through the church."</p><p>Today the church is demonstrating the authority of God to all the rulers and authorities. The church is on earth today not only for the preaching of the gospel or for self-edification, but also for the manifestation of God's authority. God's authority has been rejected everywhere on earth. It is being honored only in the church. Nowhere else on earth are people seeking God's will. The church is the only place where men seek God's will. In other words, the church is the "institution of submission." If you are not yet saved and are not yet in the church, nothing more can be said. But if you are in the church, you must uphold one basic need and principle before the Lord&mdash;you must insist that God's authority be carried out in the church today. God's will cannot be done every place on earth, yet His will must be done in the church. We must uphold God's authority in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Learning to Be Submissive in the Church</h2><p>For this reason, all the brothers and sisters in the church must learn submission. Please bear in mind that no sin is more serious than the sin of rebellion. This is something altogether contrary to the very existence of the church. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was not just good; He was submissive. Of course, whatever the Son did in Himself could only be good. Yet He said that He could do nothing by Himself. He lived not by Himself but by the will of the One who sent Him. We should remember that there is one unique authority in this universe, and we should maintain this authority. The Lord maintained it; the church must maintain it as well.</p><p>Today God is gaining in the church what He failed to gain in every age and in every other place. The church is the only place where one can learn submission. In the church, it is a matter not of good or bad, right or wrong, but of submission. The church is the place where one learns submission. No testimony is more important than the testimony of submission. The whole universe has rebelled, fallen, and taken a different stand. In the whole universe, God cannot find any other place where His authority is acknowledged. This is why God's children must all learn submission in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Submission Being<br />the Life and Nature of the Church</h2><p>Submission is the life and nature of the church. It is the basic principle that underlies the church. The church exists for the purpose of upholding submission. The church is diametrically opposed to the rebellious situation of the surrounding nations. Today the nations of the world say, "Let us break apart their bonds/And cast their ropes away from us" (Psa. 2:3). This is like saying, "Let us be free and be delivered from the bondage of the Son of God." But today the church says, "We gladly put ourselves under the bondage and chains of the Son of God to learn the lesson of submission." As a result of this declaration, something special is happening in the church. It has become the "institution" where submission is displayed. The church on earth maintains not only God's direct authority but also His indirect authority, that is, His deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>The Bible tells us many things about submission. We will consider submission from four different angles.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Submission to the Law of the Body</h2><h2 class="head3">1. There Being a Law in the Body</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ; this Body has its own law. Every organ has its particular function, and every member has its own law that governs it. Today human knowledge has expanded tremendously, but man can still not understand his own body. No one can understand all the biological laws regulating him. Nevertheless, every member in the body must submit to these laws. If a member acts and works individualistically according to its own will, it will immediately become sick. What makes the body so unique is its wholeness. As soon as this wholeness is broken, the body will surely become sick.</p><p>No child of God should violate the law of the Body of Christ and act individualistically. All independent acts are expressions of rebellion. Another word for rebellion is independent action. To act individualistically is to act against authority. It means to not submit to the authority of the Head, to not submit to the principle of oneness which God ordained in the Body, and to not submit to the law of oneness which God ordained in the Bible. Individualism is rebellion not only against the Body but also against the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Mutual Functioning<br />and Interaction of the Members</h2><p>The Lord has baptized all of His children into one Body through the Holy Spirit. Such an inward union is very intimate. If one member rejoices, the whole Body rejoices. If one member suffers, the whole Body suffers. We may not realize how deep this relationship is. Sometimes a brother will come and ask me, "Why was I sad for no reason at all when I woke up today?" or, "Why am I so happy these last few days?" Many times I cannot give an explanation. But very often the reason for their joy or sadness is not found in themselves. They have no reason to be particularly happy or sad. The Body functions in mysterious ways. When we appear before the Lord one day, we will be clear why we felt the way we did on certain days. We will be clear why we were so energized on certain days and why we were so conspicuously weak on other days. Please bear in mind that other members can affect us, and we can affect them. Although we do not understand how this interaction works, we know that oneness is a reality. Today we are not altogether clear about this oneness and how it functions in mutuality. But the fact remains that we are one and every member affects every other member in the whole Body.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Independent Acts Equaling Disobedience</h2><p>There is one law among us which we must all observe: We have to see what the Body sees, reject what the Body rejects, and accept what the Body accepts. We cannot function independently. The Body has its own law, and oneness is the authority. We cannot follow our own will. Following our own will is disobedience and rebellion against authority. Today we must realize that the Body is the authority, and the Body is the representative of the authority of Christ. If we move independently of the Body, we are rebellious.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Illustration of Cancer</h2><p>I have used the illustration of a cancerous tumor. Cancer is one of the most serious illnesses; it is even more menacing than tuberculosis. When cancer breaks out in certain parts of the body, the cells of that part begin to multiply. One cell becomes two, two become four, and four become eight. Ordinarily every cell has the ability to grow, but there is a law that regulates its growth. This law tells it when it should grow and when it should not grow.</p><p>The cells in my hand do not multiply continuously and indefinitely. If I cut my hand accidentally, the cells around my cut will start to grow again. Two cells will multiply and become four, and four will become eight. They will continue to grow until the cut is healed. The cells do this because there is a law which causes the cells to grow. When the wound is closed and the cut healed, the cells will stop growing. What tells the cells to stop growing? We do not know how they grow, and we do not know how they stop growing. We know only that it is right for cells to grow when there is a wound, and it is right for them to stop growing when the wound is healed. There is an inner law which the cells obey. They know through the biological law of the body when to grow and when to stop growing. They know submission.</p><p>Please bear in mind that the law of our body tells us about the authority of God. Every cell submits to the body's authority. When does an ailment become serious? Suppose my hand is cut by a knife and the cells on both sides of the wound grow around it. When the wound is healed, the cells stop growing. I thank God that all the cells stop growing when the wound is healed. What would happen if they continued to grow? If they did, it would be a cancerous growth. Cancer means that the body has no need of more growth, yet a cell disobeys the regulation which governs this body and continues to grow independently. This growth becomes a cancer.</p><p>Every cell must be restricted in its growth. With cancer, however, cells do not want to be told when to grow and when to stop growing; they just grow on their own. They ignore the other cells in the rest of the body. They grow by themselves continuously. We call this kind of cell malignant and evil. Please bear in mind that the whole body is affected by its growth. The cells of the whole body will be affected by malignant cells and will be forced to help them grow. Cancerous cells only cause growth to themselves; they do not bring health to the whole body. All the cells of the body should bring health to the whole body. But they all become affected by cancerous cells. When a person has cancer, the cells of the other parts of body are corrupted by the cancerous cells as soon as they come into contact with them. All the while, the cancer continues to grow. It becomes a separate entity, something no longer under the law of the body.</p><p>If a person does not submit to authority, if he does not submit to the law of the Body or work according to the principle of oneness but works according to his own will, he is a cancer in the Body. All the nutrients passing through him will be eaten up by him for his own growth, not for the growth of the Body. He will only take care of his own growth, not the growth of the Body. It is difficult for a doctor to treat cancer because another principle is operating in the body, a principle that operates on its own.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Being Restricted by the Law of the Body</h2><p>The Body of Christ is a living entity. We may say that nothing is more living, more one, and more vital than our body. Before believing in the Lord, a brother might have been individualistic, acting on his own. After he believes in the Lord, he becomes a cell in the Body, a member of the Body. Every cell is restricted by the law in the Body. There is a binding law in the Body, and a man must act according to the law of the Body. He cannot work by his own will. Once a person acts according to his own will, he becomes a tumor, a cancer in the Body. This is not a help but a damage to the Body.</p><p>We are wary of those who act individualistically, those who are not bound by the Body, who act according to their own will, and who have never learned to come under the authority of the Head. After we believe in the Lord, the first spiritual principle we should bear in mind is that the Body is God's ordained authority on earth. The Body is the authority. God's law is in the Body, and we cannot violate it. We cannot act carelessly according to our own will. When we act according to our own will, we will become unchecked malignant cells in the Body, doing our own things and completely damaging the oneness of the Body. We immediately will become a tumor. We will no longer be one with others and will become independent persons. We will not be a help to the Body but a damage to it. We must learn to accept the judgment and restriction of the Body and submit to the operation of the life of the whole Body.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Learning to Not Damage the Reality of Oneness</h2><p>The longer we go on in our Christian life before the Lord, the more we will realize the reality of the oneness of the Body. Sooner or later, we will see that oneness is a reality. It is a very sobering reality. We must learn to not damage it. It is lawlessness, rebellion, and disobedience for anyone to damage the oneness of the Body. The authority of God will not be with us if we damage it. Authority must be manifested in every cell of the Body. The cells in the Body function mutually, not individually. This is a marvelous fact. The more we comprehend the things of the Body, the more we will realize how appropriate it is to compare the church to our body.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Principle of Two or Three</h2><p>There is another principle in the Bible which we must obey&mdash;the principle of the two or three. Please read Matthew 18:15-20. The Lord Jesus said that where two or three are gathered together in one accord, whose voices are in harmony like that of music and who meet under (or are gathered into) His name, He will be in their midst. Whatever they ask, it will be done for them. This is a very great promise of the Lord. If two or three can be fully in one accord, the Lord said that He would be in their midst and would answer their prayer.</p><h2 class="head3">1. One Person Representing the Body</h2><p>The Lord told us something more. Suppose I sin against a brother today and he comes to me and says, "You have done something which offends me. You were very wrong." Suppose I say, "I do not think I was wrong. You are the one who is wrong. I do not feel that I was wrong. I feel that I was very right." Since this brother says that I am wrong, what should I do? I should learn to listen to my brother. If I am a person who has learned this lesson before the Lord, I will immediately feel that I have sinned when the brother comes to me. This is another principle in the Body. One person can represent the Body. I may be right; I may think that I am not wrong. But this brother is much more experienced than I am in the Lord, and he has learned much in the Lord. He sees that I am wrong and corrects me. If I am pliable before the Lord, I will immediately say, "Brother, please forgive me, I am wrong."</p><p>One person is enough to be the authority; there is no need to have many people. The person beside you can be the authority; he can represent the Body, the whole church. You must acknowledge that your independent way is wrong. If one person points this out to you, it is good enough. I am not saying that you have to accept every reproof that comes along. I am saying that you should have a quick response before the Lord. Often there is no need to have two or three or the whole church tell you something. You should touch and see something of the reality of the spiritual world as soon as one person says something to you. That person is the Body; he is enough to be a representative of the Body.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Two or Three Being the Authority</h2><p>Sometimes there is the need for the testimony of two or three. When one brother comes to me, I may not see the light. That brother may invite one or two other brothers to come along, brothers who are clear before the Lord and who love the Lord wholeheartedly. They may be more weighty before the Lord and more mature in their service to the Lord. When these two or three are called into the situation, they may say, "In our opinion, you are wrong." At such times, I should remember the word of the Lord: "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (Matt. 18:20).</p><p>If these two or three are in one accord, the Lord will answer their prayer and do things for them. If they are in harmony in judging certain matters, the Lord will honor their judgment. If the Lord honors their judgment concerning certain matters, should we not honor it as well? If the Lord accepts their discernment, should we not accept it as well? If the Lord considers what they have done in one accord as right, can we say that it is wrong? We should yield to their judgment immediately. If the Lord agrees with their rebuke in one accord, can we afford to ignore it? Whatever they bind shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever they loose shall have been loosed in heaven. Should we not follow what has already been done in heaven?</p><p>Two or three can be the authority. Of course, these two or three cannot speak rashly. They must be men of authority before the Lord. They must fear the Lord and obey Him. If they tell you in one accord that you are wrong, even if you do not feel that you are wrong, you have to yield to their judgment. You have to say, "I am wrong." You do not have to wait until the whole church comes to you and tells you that you are wrong. The ones who are keen will know what to do as soon as one person comes. The ones who are slower will know what to do when two persons come. Often you may not feel that you are wrong, but if two or three godly men see things the same way, you should humble yourself before the Lord. Do not be proud and do not say that you are always right.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Learning to Submit<br />to the Authority of the Church</h2><p>If you still feel that you are right after two or three brothers speak to you, Matthew 18 says that these brothers should take the matter to the church and let the whole church consider the matter before the Lord. If the whole church decides before God that you are wrong, what will you do? You may say, "Although the Body says I am wrong, the Head says that I am right. Though my parents forsake me, Jehovah will receive me. The brothers have rejected me, but the Lord will not reject me. I am bearing the cross." If you say this, it clearly shows that you are outside the church. You think that you are persecuted, martyred, and suffering under the hands of the brothers. But what you really have to do is learn to humble yourself and say, "If the church says so, that is it. There is no other judgment. All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong. I am wrong even if I am right." While we are on earth today, we must learn to subject ourselves to the authority of the church.</p><p>The church on earth bears God's authority. You must never be hardened and say, "All the brothers say that I am wrong. But I insist that I am right." A proud person has no place in the church. Proud ones cannot be submissive. They do not know what the church is. When the whole church says that you are wrong, you must learn to be meek, humble, and submissive. You must acknowledge that you are wrong. Do not say that the church has no authority to do what it does. The church has the authority. God acknowledges the church's decision before Him. He also rejects what the church rejects. Do not be so obtuse as to say that you are right when all the brothers and sisters say that you are wrong. If the Lord allows them to pronounce in one accord that you are wrong, you are probably wrong.</p><p>Every child of God should learn to humble himself in the church. Sometimes one person can represent the church. Sometimes two or three can represent the church. You must learn to be meek and pliable before the Lord. Learn the lesson of submission. God's children should stand on the principle of submission. In the church we all must learn submission.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Subject to the Deputy Authorities<br />in the Church</h2><p>God's authority in the church is represented not only by one or two or three persons. Very often it takes the whole church to represent His authority.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Responsible Brothers Who Serve as Elders</h2><p>God shows us through the Bible that the brothers who are bearing responsibility before the Lord, who are called overseers, and who serve as the elders, are the ones who represent His authority in the church. The rest of the brothers must learn to take a submissive stand before God. God has established authorities in the church; their work is to oversee the church. All the brothers must learn to accept their judgments and submit to them.</p><p>Everywhere God's children are on earth, they should seek commandments to obey; they should seek the opportunity to submit. They should not just seek work. I often feel that many young people are of little use to the Lord, because even though they can work, they cannot submit. There are many people who cannot be submissive. If you ask how many years they have been working for the Lord, they can tell you that they have worked for ten years and have done many things. But if you ask to whom they have submitted, they may not be able to name one person. The basic principle of the church life is submission.</p><p>Everyone among us should learn submission. It is pitiful for a person to have never submitted to anyone his whole life. We must learn to submit to God, and not to Him only, but also to the authority God has appointed on earth&mdash;the church. We must submit to God's ordained authority in the church, that is, the responsible brothers. We can boast of the many years we have worked for the Lord, but we cannot boast of our obedience to the Lord. We have never been submissive to anyone. This is the basic problem and the basic challenge before us. If we consider this matter carefully before the Lord, we will realize that this kind of submission is mandatory in the church.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Elder Brothers Who Are before Us</h2><p>Let us read a few verses together concerning the elders.</p><p>First Corinthians 16:15-16 says, "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints; you also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring." The household of Stephanas had no other thought in the church in Corinth except to minister to the saints. Paul told us to be subject to such ones. We must be subject to the deputy authority of God in the church. We must be subject to those who are like the household of Stephanas and also to everyone who co-works and labors with those who are like Stephanas. These are brothers more mature than we; they are firstfruits in Christ and were begotten before we were begotten. They are also concerned about our affairs. We should honor them, not despise them. Rather, we should be subject to them.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Elderly Ones</h2><p>First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders." The passage before this verse speaks of those who are elders. Here is a group of people who have more days in the Lord; they may be the elders. Peter said that the younger men should be subject to the elderly ones, who are patterns to others before the Lord (v. 3). If a young person finds someone taking care of him according to God's will, he should learn to subject himself to such a one before God. This one is a pattern to him, and he should learn to subject himself to this pattern. We should pay particular attention to our submission to the elderly brothers; they are clearly qualified to represent the Lord in the church.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Those Who Take the Lead Well<br />and Who Labor in Word and Teaching</h2><p>First Timothy 5:17 says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching." You must render double honor toward those elders who take the lead well in the church and should never despise or criticize them. You should honor the elders, even more those who labor in word and teaching. You should also honor those who have the gift of the ministry of the word. Some elders can fulfill the ministry of the word and some cannot. You should honor not only those who can fulfill such a ministry but also those who cannot. I would like to point out that many brothers hold a wrong concept about submission; they choose the kind of people they will submit to. They think they should submit to only perfect individuals. Please bear in mind that this is not the Lord's ordained way. We do not submit only to those who are perfect. We submit rather to the authority the Lord has placed over us. If it were up to us to choose a person to submit to, we would never find such a person on earth, because we would always find faults. Even if Peter appeared in our midst, we would still find many faults in him. Only one thing is necessary for our submission; if a brother is before us in the Lord, we should listen to him.</p><p>You can find a million reasons to excuse yourself. An elder may know only how to take care of the church but have no ministry of the word. You may think that you do not need to honor him since you can speak better than he can. But God's Word says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching." This is not a matter of choice. Many people cover their lawlessness and disobedience with the excuse of choice. This is foolish. If a person is more mature than you are and is ahead of you, you should submit to him and not criticize him.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Those Leading Us</h2><p>Hebrews 13:17 says, "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them." God's Word is clear. You should submit to all those who are before you and who are leading you. You cannot choose the ones you like and submit only to them. If you only listen to one brother's word and refuse another's word, this is not real submission. It is not difficult to only listen to one brother. For a person to learn submission, he must learn to submit to all the ones who are before him, not only to those who are immediately above him. He must learn to submit to those leading him, not only to the elderly who are particularly gifted and used by the Lord. You must always seek out those who are before you.</p><p>In the coming days, when you go to other localities, three or five of you will be gathered together. The first question you should ask is: To whom should I submit? You should submit to those who are before you. When three or five brothers gather together even for two or three hours, spontaneously one will be manifested to be God's appointed leader. You must submit to this one. The characteristic of a Christian is submission, not work. The characteristic of a Christian is the acknowledgment of all the leading ones. When five or six brothers are together, it is a sweet thing to see them all standing on the proper ground. As soon as you sit down with ten or twenty brothers, you should immediately identify those who are ahead of you. Once you identify them, you should submit to them.</p><p>"Obey the ones leading you and submit to them." This is because "they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you." Anyone who is ahead of you is concerned about your soul; he has to render an account for your soul. You should submit to this person before God.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Those Who Labor<br />and Take the Lead in the Lord</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:12-13 says, "Furthermore we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord and admonish you, and to regard them most highly in love because of their work." Some people have a responsibility in the Lord to take care of you and to lead you. You should honor and regard them highly. They are the ones to submit to. A Christian who has no one to submit to in this world is a strange person. Every Christian should find many who are ahead of him, who are weighty spiritually and who can render him spiritual guidance. He should submit to them.</p><p>If we do this, we will maintain the right principle in the church. God cannot find this principle in Satan, the world, or the whole universe. This principle is the principle of submission. We must all learn this basic lesson in the church. The world has rejected this principle. God must now secure it in the church. The underlying basic principle in the church is submission.</p><h2 class="head3">7. Being Subject to<br />All of God's Ordained Authorities</h2><p>We have seen that the oneness of the Body is authority itself. We have also seen that one person, two or three persons, or a local church, can represent the Body of Christ. Finally, we have seen that the elders in the Lord, those who take the lead among us, also represent the Body of Christ. All of these constitute God's authority. They are the deputy authority of God among us, and we must submit to them and honor them. We must inquire of them and listen to them. If we practice this, the Lord's name and His word will be magnified in our midst, and we will be Philadelphia indeed.</p><h1 class="series">APPENDICES</h1><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX ONE</h1><h1 class="title">A FLEXIBLE LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 11:16-19; 1 Cor. 7:29-31; 9:19-22; 2 Cor. 6:4-10; Phil. 4:11-13</h1><p class="indent1">(The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling on July 17, 1948, as part of the "New Believers" series. It was later excluded from the published version of the series. This abbreviated record is compiled from notes taken by Brother K. H. Weigh.)</p><h2 class="head1">I. TWO PHILOSOPHIES</h2><p>The church of Christ has been on this earth for two thousand years. As a result of the spread of the gospel to many nations, men have developed different views concerning Christianity. We can group these views into at least two categories. The first category suggests that all things should follow their own natural course of action. Those with this view realize that the created man has many needs, needs which have been planted by God in man. Since God has prepared many things in man's environment that are pleasing to him and which match his many needs, man should do his best to enjoy all these things in life. The second view is that of the ascetics. They think that man should deny all the demands of his body. They think that man is sinful, and that all of his needs are related to sin. Man should not enjoy any pleasure which is derived from sin. Instead, he should suffer and suppress his natural demands. Each of these two views are quite complicated; they are not simple at all.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE&mdash;A FLEXIBLE LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Not a Matter of Eating and Drinking</h2><p>At the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist came. He was a forerunner of the Lord Jesus. We can say that John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus together give us a complete pattern of the New Testament. The two combined give us a full picture of the Christian life. Matthew 11:16-19 says, "But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn. For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works." The New Testament has not laid down a strict code of outward conduct for Christians. The Lord Jesus said that John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, yet He came eating and drinking. This is the Christian life. The Christian life is one that mourns as well as plays the flute. Its emphasis is not on outward eating and drinking. The Lord Jesus acted in exactly the opposite way of John the Baptist, yet He was not opposed to John the Baptist. We can say that the Lord Jesus behaved like a Christian, and John the Baptist also behaved like a Christian. A Christian does not believe in the suppression of natural desires, nor does he believe in hedonism. A Christian can mourn, and he can play the flute. A Christian is a flexible person; he can act either way. This is what a real Christian is. Some Christians believe in enjoyment, while others believe in suffering. The two views are two "isms." In the end one turns to hedonism while the other turns to asceticism. But between these two extremes, we have a flexible life, the life that a Christian should have. We should turn our attention to different things. Our attention should not be on matters related to eating and drinking.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Able to Do All Things<br />through the Discipline of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Now let us consider the life of Paul. He served God in a very flexible way. He became all things to all men (1 Cor. 9:19-22). This is the basic qualification of a servant of the Lord. If a Christian does not behave this way, he cannot be a servant of the Lord, because the demand of the Christian life is deeper than the outward issues of the outward man. The Christian life has nothing to do with the outward man. It has to do with the inward man. The Christian life is not a matter of eating and drinking but a matter of inner fellowship. The Christian fellowship that goes on within is more important than any outward activity. To a Christian eating does not destroy anything, nor does the abstinence from it frustrate anything. We are concerned with something deeper than these things. Eating and drinking are issues involving the outward man. But the Christian life revolves around the inward man. To God, issues that are related to the outward man are minor. The important and crucial thing is for the Son of God to be life within us. To Paul, the emphasis of the Christian life is "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27). All other matters such as eating, drinking, and clothing are minor and unimportant. Paul's life was flexible.</p><p>In Philippians 4:11-13 Paul said, "I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content. I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." Paul said that he could live in abundance or abasement. He could be filled or be in hunger. These are all outward things; they are very minor. We have to remember that a worker of the Lord does not necessarily live in fullness or in hunger. He is not necessarily in lack or in excess. He is not necessarily in abasement or in abundance. Our life must be flexible. It must be under the discipline of the Holy Spirit. A worker has to go through strict discipline before he can be a flexible person.</p><p>It is actually more difficult to live a flexible life than to live either in poverty or in abundance. Being flexible means that we can travel either in economy class or in first class when we are on a boat. If we can only go first class, or if we can only go economy class, we are not a servant of God. God's servants are flexible. We have a secret within us&mdash;the Christ of glory as the empowering One. Some people hold on to the little outward things that they have, but they have nothing within them to back them up. When things go a little contrary to their ways, they immediately stumble. Many of God's servants cannot adapt to many situations because they are inflexible. As God's workers, we must give ourselves to strict dealings. The Chinese are reserved, the Americans are free and uninhibited, while the British are conservative. As a worker, we have to be able to work among all kinds of people. This is what it means to be a servant of the Lord. A worker must be able to deal even with children and elderly people. We must be flexible in all outward things.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Transcending All Outward Things</h2><p>First Corinthians 7:29-31 says, "But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away." Paul's word was very peculiar. In view of the greatness and glory of the indwelling Lord, all outward things had dwindled in significance. If we are filled with Christ, we will transcend all outward things. To a Christian, having a wife is as though having none, and those who do not have a wife need not ask for one. Weeping or not weeping does not matter. Those who rejoice do not have to worry if they are acting out of place. Those who possess are like those who do not, and those who use the world are like those who do not. God's servants have to be flexible in all outward things. A Christian is one who transcends all outward things.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Dealing with the Self,<br />and Not Being Bound by Any Mode</h2><p>In Luke 10:38-42 Mary was quiet, while Martha labored. Both were right in their services. The Lord rebuked Martha, not because she was laboring, but because she was too busy; she even implored the Lord to send her sister to help her. She was too busy. It is right to labor, but one must be able to become calm as well. A worker of God should learn both to be quiet as well as to labor. It is not that easy to live a flexible life.</p><p>In all the lessons we learn related to our flesh, flexibility is probably the most difficult of them all. Some people have a hard time eating simple food; others have a harder time eating good food. These things are problems for them because they have made the kingdom of God a matter of eating and drinking. Paul said that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 14:17). We have to learn to be a broad person, one who can accommodate everything. Madam Guyon once said that a man who is in perfect union with God is a teacher to the elderly and a friend to children. In 2 Corinthians 6:4-10 Paul went on a long discourse to show how flexible he was as a servant of the Lord: "As having nothing and yet possessing all things" (v. 10). This is the standard of God's worker. Only those whose self has been thoroughly dealt with are able to live such a flexible life. It is difficult for some Christians to live a flexible life because they still live by their self. The self has its own concepts and ideas, and it always considers itself to be right. It will not submit to the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit. These Christians are lopsided. We should allow God to deal with our self. As soon as the self is gone, we can become flexible.</p><p>Hence, we must go through fundamental, thorough, and strict dealings before we can run a straight race before us. Only then will we be able to embrace the proper spiritual "contradictions" within us. God's servants should always bear in mind that God's way is never a single-track line, but a two-track line. Muslims are for the enjoyment of life. Buddhists are for suffering. But a standard Christian is not biased toward any side. He lives according to God's sovereign arrangements, transcending the outward man. Paul's outward man was alive, yet his inward man was hidden in God and was forever unshaken. Our true person is the one that lives in God; the outward man is merely a performance. It is a glorious thing for the inner man and the outward man to be separated from each other. The inner man should be hidden in God, while the outward man should be thoroughly broken. This is the basic qualification for working for God. Anyone who is bound in just one mode has not passed through the basic dealings.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Outward Man Needing the Dealing,<br />while the Inner Man Needing to Be Strengthened</h2><p>Whenever a worker of the Lord goes to a place, he has to live the same way that the people in that place do. His clothing and food have to be the same as the people's. If the gospel is confined by things like eating, drinking, and clothing, our faith will not be much different from that of the worldly religions; we will not convey the right flavor that is in our faith. Our Lord did not bring anything with Him when He came to the earth. He ate and drank. He was genuinely a man. The servant cannot be greater than the master. Our inner man has to be strengthened, while our outward man should not insist on anything. It should be happy to go along with anyone. For this reason, our outward man must be dealt with. The Christian life is neither a matter of eating nor of not eating. It is neither hedonism nor asceticism. The Christian life is flexible. What is within us is far greater and more glorious, and we should not be affected by the outward mode of living in any way.</p><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXPECTING THE LORD'S RETURN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 3:11; 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Thes. 1:9-10; Phil. 3:20; Titus 2:11-13</h1><p class="indent1">(The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling on September 23, 1948, as part of the "New Believers" series. It was later excluded from the published version of the series. This abbreviated record is compiled from notes taken by Brother K. H. Weigh.)</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE BIBLICAL PROMISE<br />CONCERNING THE LORD'S RETURN</h2><p>The Bible contains a wonderful promise of the Lord's return. From the Old Testament through the New Testament, every book touches on the subject of the Lord's return. Bible students have counted the number of times that the New Testament speaks of this subject and have told us that one out of every twenty verses in the New Testament speaks of the Lord's return. This is an important subject. Do not think that everything was finished when God's Son came and accomplished the work of redemption. The Lord will come back to this earth. From Genesis to Malachi, the Old Testament repeatedly speaks of Christ's second coming. The same is true in the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation. We can say that this subject is the greatest subject in the Bible. The biblical record of the Lord's first coming is considerably smaller than that of His second coming. We should pay much attention to the subject of His second coming. We should memorize at least a few passages of the Scripture concerning this subject. Please carefully read these references: John 14:1-3, Acts 1:10-11, and Hebrews 9:28. A fourth reference appears in the last book, the book of Revelation. This book was written over sixty years after the Lord's ascension. Jerusalem already had been destroyed, and the first generation of apostles was almost all gone. Even then, however, the Holy Spirit spoke in Revelation 22:20 of the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">II. A HEAVENLY CALLING</h2><p>Today we not only look back at the work of the cross; we also look forward to the second coming of Christ. We are not only here serving the Lord, but we are here waiting for His coming back. It is not our only intention to serve Him here on earth. In the past we have spoken several times concerning the subject of the breaking of bread. Our breaking of bread is a remembrance of the Lord; this remembrance will last until He returns. Every Christian's eye should be set on Christ's second coming. While it is true that we preach obedience, praise, service, and many other subjects, it is not our only intention to be serving in this way forever. Our hope is that the church will become the bride of Christ one day. Everything we do is with the view of the second coming of Christ. Although we emphasize the local church and our work, we are not building anything on earth today. We are waiting for the Lord's coming back. We are not preaching the doctrine of the Lord's second coming; we are truly waiting for His coming again. Our calling is a heavenly one; it is not earthly. Our ministry and service are heavenly. We are not looking for a great building on earth. Everything on earth will pass away one day. Five great signs in the Bible indicate to us that the Lord's coming is very near.</p><p>The Christian life on earth is a life of waiting for the Lord's return. What does it mean to wait for His return? To wait for His return means that while we live as others do, we have an expectation of His return always within us. Miss M. E. Barber was a person in whom I found no trace of thought of remaining on earth for a long time. She was genuinely waiting for the Lord's return. Once I was walking with her on a street, and she said, "Perhaps, I will meet the Lord when we turn this corner." She asked me to walk at a distance from her on the other side of the sidewalk, and repeated, "I do not know whether this will be the corner for me." Those who wait for the Lord's return are like a man walking down a precipitous hill; he does not know for sure when he will turn a corner and meet someone walking up the same path. Our sister genuinely expected the Lord's return daily and hourly. Notice that we are speaking of our expectation of His return, not our belief in His return. Many people can speak about the Lord's return. They study the Lord's return and believe in His return, but this does not mean that they are expecting His return. Many people pay much attention to such subjects as the rapture, the judgment seat of Christ, the millennium, the New Jerusalem, and the new heaven and new earth. Many people are very familiar with the prophecies concerning the Lord's return, but they are not necessarily waiting for His return. We have to remember that we are heavenly citizens. We should be taught by grace to expect the Lord's return. We put no hope in this earth. We know that this earth will never change for the better. While we serve, work, and labor with God here on earth, we are calling and gathering a group of people to come under the Lord's name for His satisfaction. We serve and work for the sake of His second coming.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TWO COMINGS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ has two comings, and these two comings are different. In His first coming to earth, He died on the cross for the remission of sins. Through this, sinners are reconciled to God; they can draw near to God and partake of His life. But this work for man is only half complete. The problem of sin has been settled, but sin itself is still around us. The power of death is finished in us, but our body still has to pass through death. Although we have a new life within us, we do not yet have a new environment. If Christ does not come again, nothing will be completed. The more holy we become inwardly, the darker, more sinful, and more lawless the world is to us outwardly. Our lips were once unclean. One day the holy fire came and cleansed our lips. However, we are still living among men with unclean lips. The second coming of Christ will not settle our personal sins but will settle all the sins in this world. In His first coming, He settled our personal sins. In His second coming, He will settle the sins of this world.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PROBLEMS IN THIS WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Social Problems</h2><p>Today the world is full of all kinds of problems. How will these problems be solved? What should be our attitude towards these problems? Many social reformers pay much attention to the problems in society. Some say to Christians, "Your personal problems have been solved. But what do you say about the existence of classes, the poverty of the peasants, the suffering of livestock, and the proliferation of sinful establishments such as theaters, brothels, dance halls, and gambling casinos?" Those who pay attention to society are disturbed to see many social ills such as crime, sickness, poverty, and inequality still prevailing. They ask us what should be done about these things. We must tell them that God is not oblivious to these problems. God is not merely for individuals being saved, forgiven, and going to heaven. We must tell them that the salvation spoken of in the Bible is not only for individuals. Heaven is not merely related to the matter of individual salvation; it relates to a time when the whole world will turn to Christ. (However, we are not talking about universalism.) The Bible first speaks of personal salvation. But this does not mean that it ignores social problems. We cannot tackle social problems now, because they are not within our ability to solve at the present time. According to the Bible, God has called us to a heavenly calling, which means that Christians are only responsible for the preaching of the gospel. The responsibility of the church is to gather men into the name of Christ. Our hope and work are not on the earth. We are not here to improve society. The Lord said that there is no hope or peace in this world. All social problems will be settled when the Lord comes back again. When He comes back, all social ills will be removed. Christianity does address these problems, but there is a matter of time as to when they will be addressed. When the Lord comes again, these problems will be solved.</p><p>God's children have no other obligations besides leading men to Christ and waiting for His return. We do not expect class distinctions in this world to be removed. We do not expect sin and crime to be eradicated from this world. One day the Lord will deal with all the problems that the sociologists and scientists cannot handle today. Our expectation is different from that of the world. We expect the day of the Lord's return, and this day is drawing near. There are two aspects to the Lord's return, the personal aspect and the world's aspect. Personally, we wait for His return because we want to see Him. As far as the world is concerned, the Lord's return will solve its many problems. Many Christians try to reform society, and in the end they are corrupted by society itself. Many good Christians try to change the world, and in the end they themselves are defiled. We should never be tempted to engage ourselves in these works, because we know that these are the Lord's work.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Travailing of the Creatures</h2><p>Today many people say that animals are suffering and abused and are even near the point of extinction. They say that we should do something to protect them. The trouble is that humans today are treated worse than cows and horses. How can we first take care of the lower forms of creatures? In other countries there are advocates of animal rights. Romans 8 says that the whole creation groans for deliverance. We know that one day the whole creation will be freed from the bondage of corruption. Then, as foretold in the Old Testament, the world will be a place where "the wolf will dwell with the lamb;/And the leopard will lie down with the kid,/And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; /And a young boy will lead them about./The cow and the bear will graze;/Their young will lie down together; /And the lion will eat straw like the ox" (Isa. 11:6-7). We know that one day all the creatures will be delivered. But that day is not today. Today, protecting the animals is not our work.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Earthly Squabbling for Power</h2><p>Every group of politicians in every nation of the world is vying for the center stage, and every nation in this world is trying to take advantage of other nations. There are strife and unrest nationally and internationally. We are not called to engage ourselves in the work of the League of Nations; our work is not to help weak and struggling countries. The angels one day will proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). We can answer the unbelievers even today with this word.</p><p>Christians' personal problems are solved by Christ's first coming. The social problems of this world will be solved at the time of Christ's second coming. Then the world will not be like the world we have today. All of the problems listed above will disappear in the twinkling of an eye.</p><h2 class="head1">V. WHAT CHRISTIANS SHOULD DO TODAY</h2><p>What then should Christians do in this world? A Christian should do his best to render help to others. For example, a doctor should do his best to help others by treating their diseases. A scientist should do his best to help others by improving nutrition and other things. But one thing should be kept in mind: We should remain pure before the Lord. We should not be contaminated by the world. Neither should we close our eyes to the affairs of this world. During His first coming, Christ labored on individuals; He did not try to do anything about the social system. In the same way, today Christians should labor on individuals; they should not try to build up any system or institution. Before our personal problems or the world's problems were solved, we were sinners and we lived among sinners. Today we have believed in the Lord. We have become the righteous among the sinners. But there will be a day when the righteous will be among the righteous. All the problems will be solved on that day when the Lord comes back. Today we should give to others what we can afford to give. We should not engage in any form of revolution. Revolutions happen because there are bad institutions. Men start revolutions because they hate these institutions. They even sacrifice their blood for their revolutions. But we cannot sacrifice our blood for the sake of destroying any social system. When Christ comes the second time, He will change all social systems and institutions. Today, if we engage in such a work, there is a great possibility that we will be disapproved. It is foolish for us to sacrifice ourselves today. The world has become what it is today because too many innocent people have sacrificed themselves. Christians should not aspire to change any institution of this world.</p><p>The Bible shows us a heavenly calling. Our calling is not on earth. This world is not our concern. We live day by day in this world. But nothing with us is permanent; nothing is indispensable for us, and nothing is compulsory. There is nothing in this world that we cannot live without, and there is nothing that we must have. We take what the Lord gives to us in this world. It is all right for us to have more and it is all right for us to have less. If the Lord arranges for us to have a smooth pathway, we can take it. If the Lord arranges for us to have a rugged pathway, we can take it as well. We are here to wait for the Lord's coming; we are not here to seek after worldly blessing. When Christ comes again, every earthly thing will be finished. While we live on earth, we do not live for ourselves, for our families, or for society; we live for the Lord. When the Lord comes again, that will be the happiest day of all days. Everything in this world is changing; only things pertaining to righteousness abide forever. If we do not belong to this world and do not settle down in this world, that day will be of unspeakable glory to us. On that day, the glory of the Lord will fill the church. His kingdom will come on earth, and the whole universe will be subject to Christ. This is why the church does not have any lingering love for the works of this earth.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. WHAT CHRIST WILL SETTLE WHEN HE COMES</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Injustice</h2><p>When the Lord comes back, the first thing He will settle is injustice. Today the biggest problem in the world is injustice. Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord will "judge the poor in righteousness,/And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land." To judge with justice is something more than what the world can do today. It is not a Christian's job. When the Lord comes again, He will execute justice.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Wars</h2><p>When the Lord comes again, He will settle all wars. Today man cannot deal with the problem of wars. World War II has just finished, but many places in the world are still at war. Everyone agrees that there should be peace, but there is no real peace. Man cannot achieve peace through war. Yet Isaiah 2:4 says that when the millennium comes, men will "beat their swords into plowshares,/And their spears into pruning hooks,/Nation will not lift the sword against nation,/Nor will they learn war anymore." We should realize that we are not the ones to disarm others of swords and spears. We do not wage wars, and we do not stop wars in the hope of achieving peace. These are things beyond us. When Christ comes, He will annul all wars and bring in peace.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Sicknesses</h2><p>When Christ comes He will settle all sicknesses. Today many people pay attention to public health, hygiene, and medical aid. But sickness will never be thoroughly eradicated today. In the Bible the two books that speak of plagues the most are Ezekiel and Jeremiah. Both books show us that plagues are in the Lord's hand; the Lord is in control of these things. In the prophecies in Revelation and Matthew, we are told that plagues will increase in the end times. A Christian should not be given merely to the work of hygiene and medical aid. We must realize that sicknesses in this world will increase. Isaiah 33:24 says that when Christ comes, no one will say, "I am sick." Ezekiel 47:12 says that in the new heaven and new earth, the tree of the new city will be for the healing of the nations. Hence, when the Lord comes again, the problem of sickness will be solved.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Famine</h2><p>When the Lord comes again, the problem of famine will also be solved. In China many people have recently turned their attention to the problem of famine. Some have done very commendable works. One interesting thing that our eyes have observed is that the harvest of man's labor always requires much plowing and tilling, whereas thorns, thistles, and weeds grow well without man's tending. The tares do not need sowing, yet they make their way through the wheat. No matter how hard scientists and horticulturists try, they cannot stop weeds from growing. In Genesis God cursed the land, and it no longer yielded its strength to man. This is a fact. Today the earth no longer yields its strength to man. We have never heard of a thorn that requires man's tilling. It is true that we have made achievements in irrigation and machineries, and improvements in seed and fertilizers, but we still cannot eliminate weeds. Neither have we been able to take care of all of man's other needs.</p><p>Man has to fight against nature and wrestle with it in order to survive. If he allows nature to take its own course, he will not have a harvest. We are not depreciating the efforts of the scientists. We are merely saying that such problems cannot be solved by man. God also has no intention for the church to solve these problems. We are here only for the Lord's return. The Bible says that when Christ comes back, the earth will once more yield its strength to man. Isaiah 43:19-20 and 35:1 speak of God making "rivers in the desert" and of the desert blossoming "like the rose." Isaiah 51:3 says that God will make the "wilderness like Eden." When Christ comes again, there will be no more desert, and the thorns and thistles will all pass away.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Education and Knowledge</h2><p>Educators and philosophers teach men about good and evil and to turn away from evil and to choose good. But no one can solve the problem of sin in man's heart. No educator can give a man the knowledge of God. Hebrews 8:10-11 says that when Christ comes back again, we will have the knowledge of God that comes from our intuition, and all will know God, from the least to the greatest.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Establishments of Vice</h2><p>There are many establishments of vice in this world. Many places are hotbeds of sin. The church and the Christians are saving men out of these sinful places. Yet these establishments remain unchanged. Matthew 13:41-42 says that when the Lord comes again, the angels will cast out all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness, that is, those who corrupt others. In an instant the Lord will cleanse the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. CHRISTIANS NOT TAKING ROOT ON EARTH</h2><p>What we have spoken of can be considered as the social philosophy of a Christian. In other chapters we have seen various aspects of the Christian faith and walk. While we remain on earth, we should do what we need to do, but our hearts should always be set on the Lord's return. Our attention should be on the heavenly calling. We have no permanent plans for things of this world. Even the most spiritual things cannot bind us or imprison us in the earthly realm. Christians should not take root on this earth. The earth is not a place for Christians to plant their roots. God's Word is being fulfilled bit by bit, and the Lord is at the door. Today our eyes are not set on the problems of the church; we are waiting instead for the Lord's coming. This is our heavenly calling. May the Lord be gracious to us and may our eyes be set solely upon His return.</p><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX THREE</h1><h1 class="title">SELLING ALL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 18:18-30; 19:1-10; Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35; Matt. 6:19-24</h1><p class="indent1">(The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling in 1948 as part of the "New Believers" series.

In order to understand this message in the proper light and in the context of Watchman Nee's ministry during this period, the reader should also refer to Volume 57 of The Collected Works, The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry.)</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE PREREQUISITE</h2><p>The first thing we should realize concerning a new believer selling all to take the Lord's way is that the church must first take the lead to do this. Otherwise, we will only be speaking in vain. Whether or not a new believer gets through in this matter depends on the condition of the church. If the church is not a consecrated church, it would be useless to speak of consecration to others. If the church is not separated from the world, it would be useless to speak about baptism or separation from the world. If the brothers and sisters in a church do not have the practice of selling their all, it would be useless to speak to new ones about selling their all. God's children must stand on the ground of what they preach before they can lead new believers to the same ground. I am not saying that God will not do a special work to raise up new brothers and sisters to take this way. But it is not easy for new ones to take this way. Some must first set the example by taking this stand. Others can then deal with the issue easily. If everyone casts every consideration aside and gives his all, we can expect new ones to cast every consideration aside and give their all. If we do not do this, it will be hard for the new ones to do it. A locality must be assured that its believers are very much strengthened before it can expect this practice to be accepted smoothly. If the brothers and sisters are not that strong, this practice cannot be implemented.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE LORD'S DEMAND ON THE YOUNG RULER</h2><p>Let us begin with the story of the young ruler in Luke 18. The young ruler was a very moral person. He was quite virtuous as far as his conduct before God was concerned. He had kept all the commandments, and he respected the Lord Jesus very much. This is why he addressed the Lord as "Good Teacher" (v. 18). The Lord Jesus was quite kind to him; He was even moved with love for him (Mark 10:21). He knew that it was not easy to gain such a person.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Need for Absoluteness in Serving the Lord</h2><p>Yet the Lord laid down a requirement. If a man wants to serve Him or follow Him, he has to be perfect. Notice the Lord's word: "If you want to be perfect," "one thing you lack" (Matt. 19:21; Mark 10:21). In other words, the Lord told him that in order to follow Him, a man has to follow Him absolutely all the way; he cannot lack one thing. He cannot take care of ninety-nine things but leave one thing untouched for himself. Those who do this cannot follow the Lord. The Lord demands that when we come to Him, everything belonging to us has to come to Him as well. The Lord requires that we be perfect; He wants us to follow Him absolutely. Anything short of this will not do.</p><p>The young ruler had kept the commandments from his youth. He feared God. Yet the Lord said that even a person such as he lacked one thing, without which he could not go on. This one thing was to sell all his possessions, to give to the poor, and then to follow the Lord. This was the only way for him to go on.</p><h2 class="head2">B. In Order to Follow the Lord One Must Sell All</h2><p>Hence, no one can follow the Lord who will not sell all his possessions. If one does not sell his all, he cannot follow the Lord; he cannot go on in this way. We must have a deep realization of this serious matter.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Keeping One's Possessions<br />Meaning Keeping One's Sorrow</h2><p>The Bible says that when the young ruler heard the Lord's word, he left in sorrow. A man can be so close to the Lord and so clear about Him and yet still refuse to let go of his possessions. He can still try to keep his possessions. But when he keeps his possessions, he also keeps his sorrow. Money pierces a person through with many pains (1 Tim. 6:10). A man cannot accumulate riches and joy at the same time. If he accumulates riches, he accumulates headaches for himself as well. If he saves his possessions, he saves sorrow and troubles for himself as well. Here was a man who kept his possessions, but he could no longer follow the Lord. If you want your money, you should not follow the Lord. If you do not follow the Lord, your money can remain intact, and your sorrow will also remain intact. Money and sorrow always go together. You cannot retain your money without retaining your sorrow.</p><p>Only those who have handed over their all can live a joyous life. Those who are unwilling to give up their possessions always live a sad life. I have noticed this too clearly in many places. I can predict that the brothers who cling to their money will always abide in sorrow. It is not a happy thing to cling to material possessions. This is very clear. We should tell new believers that if they want joy, they should give up everything to follow the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Salvation, Receiving Eternal Life,<br />and Entering God's Kingdom</h2><p>The young ruler would not let go of his possessions, and he left in sorrow. When the Lord saw this, He remarked, "How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" (Mark 10:23). The first point in this story concerns inheriting eternal life. Following this there is the matter of entering the kingdom of God. Those who heard the Lord's words concerning entering the kingdom asked, "Then who can be saved?" (v. 26). Here the matters of salvation, receiving eternal life, and entering the kingdom of God are all linked together. If we want to inherit eternal life, we have to part with our possessions. Otherwise, our possessions will hinder us from inheriting eternal life. If we want to enter God's kingdom, we must remember that it is impossible for a rich man to enter in. If we want to be saved, the Lord will save us. Yet we must remember that if the Lord does save us, we have to give up our riches. This does not mean that one is saved by giving up his riches. It means that if a man is saved, he will spontaneously give up his riches.</p><p>It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. In the same way it is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Yet all the brothers and sisters among us are camels. Those who are rich are big camels, and those who are less rich are smaller camels; everyone is a camel. Just as a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle, a rich man cannot enter the kingdom of God. If the Lord says that no rich man can enter God's kingdom, it must mean that no rich man can enter it.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Selling All to Inherit Eternal Life</h2><p>When the disciples heard this they were worried. They asked, "Then who can be saved?" They misunderstood the Lord. What did the Lord say to the young man? When the young man asked, "What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" the Lord's answer was to sell all he had and give to the poor. Hence, one must sell all that he has before he can receive eternal life. A little while later the Lord said that a rich man entering God's kingdom is like a camel going through the eye of a needle. This means that a rich man cannot enter God's kingdom. If you put the two things together, you can see that a rich man cannot enter God's kingdom, and that one must sell his all before he can inherit eternal life.</p><p>Peter behaved liked a Bible teacher. When he heard this, he felt this was a terrible requirement. He thought, "If the inheriting of eternal life is related to one's work, and if one cannot enter God's kingdom if he is rich, but instead must sell his all before going in, this must mean that the entrance no longer depends on faith. If this is the case, who can be saved? Who can sell all that he has before inheriting eternal life? Who can first be poor in order to be saved?"</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Central Issue of Selling One's All</h2><p>The Lord Jesus gave the answer to this question. This word is the central subject of this story. We must lay hold of this word. He said, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (Luke 18:27). A new believer must realize that it is impossible to first give up everything and then enter God's kingdom. The Lord acknowledged that this is impossible.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN<br />BEING POSSIBLE WITH GOD</h2><p>The mistake of the young man was not his reluctance to sell his all but his turning away in sorrow. God knows, and the Lord also knows, that this is something that is impossible with men. There was nothing strange in his not being able to make it. The Lord knows that we cannot sell all that we have to give to the poor. Yet this man turned away in sorrow because he thought that since the matter was impossible for him, it must be impossible for God as well. He knew that it was terrible that he could not give up his riches. But why would the Lord, knowing that he could not, still ask him to give them up? The Lord Jesus' answer was, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." How can a camel go through the eye of a needle? This is impossible. In the same principle, everyone in this world loves money; it is impossible for anyone to sell all his possessions. But it would be a big mistake if anyone were to turn away in sorrow just because he could not make it! If we turn away in sorrow, we limit the power of God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Man's Problem Being His Refusal<br />to Accept the Power of God</h2><p>The young man could not make it. Yet he did not consider the possibility of God making it. In other words, the Lord was prepared to give grace to this young man, yet he did not take it. All he needed to do was to stop and say, "Lord! I cannot give up my money. Please give me the grace. What is impossible for me is possible for You. I cannot make it, but You can. I cannot do it, but You can work in me to the point that I can. Lord! I cannot give up my money. I cannot sell all that I have to follow You. But You can. I ask for Your grace!" It was his mistake that he did not pray. It was his mistake that he did not believe and did not ask. It was his mistake to turn away in sorrow. Man's mistake does not lie in his weakness but in his refusal to accept God's power. It does not lie in his inability but in his refusal to allow God to be the able One for him. It does not lie in the fact that his work has come short but in the fact that he has not allowed God to save him to the point that his work will come up to the standard. This is the main point in the Lord's word. The central subject of this passage is the sentence "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." The Lord Jesus was willing to show the young ruler that even though man could not make it, God could make it. Yet the young ruler only saw his inability; he turned away in sorrow.</p><h2 class="head2">B. There Being a Way<br />for Both the Willing and the Unwilling</h2><p>A new believer should thank the Lord like Peter did if God causes him to give up everything joyfully. But if he, like the young ruler, finds it hard to obey, there is still a way for him. There is a way for those who respond as quickly as the twelve disciples. There is also a way for those who are as reluctant as the young ruler. All one has to do is to bow his head and say, "Lord, I cannot make it. I need grace!" This is the way. The young ruler did not do this. He left the Lord in sorrow. This was his mistake.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Absolute to Take the Christian Way</h2><p>When the Lord saw the young man leave, He remarked how hard it was for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Peter then said to the Lord, "Behold, we have left our own things and have followed You" (Luke 18:28). The Lord answered Peter saying, "Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God, who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life" (vv. 29-30). The Lord showed the disciples that following Him means giving up everything for His sake and for the gospel's sake. In order to be a Christian at all, one has to set aside everything to follow the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Setting Aside Everything to Serve the Lord</h2><p>A young person must see that in order to serve God, he has to set aside, sell, or give up everything before he can follow the Lord. When the Lord called the twelve apostles, they happily and instantly followed Him. They did not linger for a moment. They gave up their boats, their nets, and everything to follow the Lord. We find such men in the early days, and we find such men in China today. Like Peter, James, and John, these ones hear the Lord's calling, and they follow the Lord instantly and absolutely. We have to thank the Lord for this. Yet if there are men who, like the young ruler, find it difficult to respond to the Lord or to give up everything to follow Him, thank the Lord, there is still a way. The way lies in this: What is impossible to men is possible to God.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Only One Person Being Afraid to Follow</h2><p>Here we find a right combination: Thirteen people were called by the Lord. Eleven gave up everything instantly and absolutely, one was false, and the other one was unwilling. Of the thirteen, eleven were good, one was false&mdash;Judas, and the remaining one, the thirteenth one, was the young ruler. We should not think that when the Lord's word goes out that only one person will genuinely follow the Lord. On the contrary, the Bible shows us that only one was afraid to follow Him.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Taking a Firm Stand before the Lord</h2><p>Please remember that as long as we take a firm stand and the church also takes a firm stand before God, we do not have to worry whether there are too many young rulers. We should realize that men like the young ruler are rare cases. Not everyone in the church is a Judas. In the same way, not everyone in the church is a young ruler. Of the thirteen, eleven were absolute. When God's word is released, and the place is right and the audience proper, it is rare to find one who will not follow the Lord in an absolute way.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE LESSON IN ZACCHEUS'S SALVATION</h2><p>Let us now turn to the story of Zaccheus. Zaccheus was a Jew, yet he worked for the Roman government. Humanly speaking, he was a traitor because he collaborated with the Roman Empire to extort from his own countrymen. He was a tax collector appointed by the Roman government; he was a Jew in his own Jewish land, yet he was collecting taxes from his own countrymen for the Romans, the very ones who had overrun his native land.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Zaccheus Being a Tax Collector and a Sinner</h2><p>Zaccheus was not a very moral person. He was not as noble as the young ruler, who had kept the commandments from his youth. He was a tax collector who worked for foreigners. The tax collectors of that day, like all tax collectors, were greedy men. They always tried to get more money from the people. At that time two groups of people were very much despised by the Jews. One was sinners, and the other was tax collectors. These names carried the same stigma as that of a hooligan today; they suggested men of bad reputation. But on that day the Lord Jesus came and passed through. Here was a man with great power. He was drawing many people to Himself. "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him" (John 6:44). It was the Father who drew Zaccheus to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Lord Met Zaccheus, but<br />Did Not Preach to Him</h2><p>Zaccheus was drawn to the Lord. He wanted to see Jesus. Because he was too short, he had to climb up a sycamore tree. Yet before he saw the Lord, the Lord saw him first. When the Lord saw him, He did not preach to him a sermon. He did not say, "You should confess your sins and repent." He did not tell him, "You should not have extorted from others," or "You should not have sinned or become greedy." Neither did the Lord tell him to sell all that he had, give to the poor, and follow Him. The Lord did not pass on any teaching to him. He only said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house" (Luke 19:5). Please pay attention to the fact that the Lord did not exhort him in any way. He did not give him any teaching on work as He did in chapters five through seven of Matthew. He did not speak about the doctrine of regeneration of John 3, the teaching on the living water of John 4, the teaching on light of John 8, or the teaching on the one grain that fell into the ground of John 12. The Lord did not preach to Zaccheus at all. He did not exhort him in any way. It was just a personal touch, a personal encounter. Here was a heart that was after the Lord. Here was a person who had chosen Him. In fact, as far as doctrine was concerned, Zaccheus did not know anything.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Others Feeling Indignant</h2><p>The Lord did not preach to him at all. He simply said, "Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house." When Zaccheus heard this, he received the Lord with joy. When some of the people around saw this, they were indignant. "How could Jesus of Nazareth go to this man's house? He could have gone to any house but this one. Even if He were ignorant about this man, His disciples should have investigated and found out that Zaccheus is not an upright man and does not have a good reputation. Why would they not tell their teacher this?" Everyone knew what kind of person Zaccheus was. Everyone knew his background. When they heard the Lord's word, they all murmured in their heart.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Wherever the Lord Goes, Money Is Released</h2><p>Our point here is that the Lord did not preach to Zaccheus at all. He only said one word, "Today I must stay in your house." One word was good enough. Even though He was not yet in Zaccheus's house, His word was powerful enough. Wherever the Lord goes, money is released. Wherever He goes, wealth is released. Wherever He goes, the love of money goes away. It seems as if the Lord was saying, "As long as I can visit this house, everything will be fine. For Me just saying that I must stay in this house is as powerful as Me actually being in the house." The words took effect. The few words "I must stay" took effect, and something happened.</p><h2 class="head2">E. One Word Stripped Zaccheus's House</h2><p>How can we prove that something happened? When Zaccheus heard these words, immediately he stood and said, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" (Luke 19:8). This word means that his whole house was stripped. One word from the Lord Jesus stripped Zaccheus's house of everything.</p><h2 class="head1">V. WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN<br />BEING POSSIBLE WITH GOD</h2><p>The Lord exhorted the young ruler, yet the young ruler did not make it. The Lord did not exhort Zaccheus, yet he made it. Both were rich men. The rich man in Luke 18 was young, while the one in chapter nineteen was old. According to common sense, an old man should be stingy with money while a young man should be generous with it. But what we have here is something very different. One case points to the impossibility with men, while the other case points to the possibility with God. We should not skip over this matter lightly. It is not easy to sell everything and to follow the Lord. Who can give up all of his possessions? A man has to be crazy to give up everything. But Zaccheus's story tells us that what is impossible with men is possible with God. Zaccheus did this without any teaching. The Lord did not tell him what to do, yet he did it. What we have here is a principle. It shows us how easy this thing can be done.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE CAMEL GOING THROUGH<br />THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE</h2><p>As soon as God does something, the camel will go through the eye of the needle. You should tell new believers that in Luke 18 there was a camel who hesitated before the eye of a needle and who turned around after looking at it for a while. Yet in Luke 19 there was another camel who went through the eye of the needle. Please remember that what is impossible with men is possible with God. Chapter eighteen tells us that with men it is impossible, while chapter nineteen tells us that with God it is possible. If you turn to the Lord, things will happen in an instant. Your problems will be solved in an instant. Humanly speaking, selling all that one has is madness, but this matter was settled in an instant.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Salvation Coming to This House</h2><p>How can this be settled in an instant? One must not presume that God is able for no reason at all. The Lord shows us two reasons. First, Zaccheus was a son of Abraham; second, salvation came to his house. Zaccheus did not do this by himself. It was not because of Zaccheus himself that he heard the Lord's commandment. He did not weep and pray repeatedly. He did not bargain with himself in numerous attempts to get through and then grit his teeth and do it. He did not give in a little one day, a little the next day, a little more the third day, until he no longer held anything back. The Lord said that it was not Zaccheus's decision, struggle, consideration, or endeavor that made him willing to sell all. Why was his house, which had been built up through years of savings, gambles, and sacrifice of honor, stripped bare in an instant? It was "bankrupted" in an instant because salvation came to his house. Zaccheus did not save himself; the Lord saved him.</p><p>Salvation has come to this house! The Lord's power has come to this house! When this happens, everything moves speedily and promptly. Please notice the two occurrences of the word house. In verse 5 the Lord said, "I must stay in your house," and in verse 9 He said, "Today salvation has come to this house." This clearly shows that the Lord is the very salvation that came to Zaccheus's house. When the Lord comes to our house, salvation comes to our house. The Lord's coming is salvation's coming. Once He comes, everything becomes possible. The young ruler, in effect, said that God could not do it. Zaccheus, in effect, said that God could do it. No man can be freed from the bondage of money. Man will always turn away in sorrow. But when God shows mercy to a person and saves him, nothing becomes impossible.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Lord Seeking Those Who Are Lost in Riches</h2><p>In the end the Lord concluded, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). This is a very familiar verse in Christianity. One chief reason that the Son of Man came is to seek those who are lost in riches. All those who love money are lost and estranged. Today the Lord is seeking. Zaccheus was found by the Lord. Today the Lord has also found us. Originally we were all lost. We were lost in money. But the Lord has found us, and all of our problems can go away. Once money leaves, all our problems go away.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. GOD'S WAY TODAY</h2><p>Consider these two chapters, Luke 18 and 19. The Lord told the young ruler to sell all he had, and he went away in sorrow. But the Lord did not say anything to Zaccheus, yet something happened. When the Lord was on earth, He initiated this practice. After the church came into existence at Pentecost, this matter was practiced again. When a church is proper, all of these things will happen without much struggle.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Selling Everything Being the Lord's Command</h2><p>The main thing we should note in Acts 2 and 4 is that the believers had all things in common at the beginning of the church life. No one said that he kept something as his own. In other words, the Lord's hand was on every saved person. Once a man received eternal life, something happened. Among the ones who had this life, their sphere of possessions began to be diffused; their possessions began to move away from their private hands. The next thing we find is that men spontaneously sold their properties and houses. In chapter four the believers sold all their properties and houses. This is the way the Lord wants us to take. His commandment is that we should sell our all.</p><h2 class="head2">B. All Ordinary Possessions<br />Being Held in Common</h2><p>Before a man follows the Lord, he carries many things with him, such as his assets and daily necessities. Once he comes to the Lord and the Lord touches him, his possessions become common goods. From that point on, no one can say that a certain object belongs to him. No one can say that he is taking advantage of anyone else, and no one can say that anything is his own. The same object will be shared by all. The same money can be in your pocket, or it can be in my pocket. The same clothes can be worn by you, or they can be worn by me. Whatever our practice is, this should be the kind of flavor we carry. Such a practice has to do with one's ordinary possessions.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Properties, Houses, and Valuables to Be Sold</h2><p>As for properties, houses, and valuables, they have to be sold. Anything special should be sold. Properties, houses, as well as other forms of tangible assets such as jade, antiques, and calligraphy collections must be sold. After they are sold, the proceeds should be given to the poor.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Nothing to Be Held in Private</h2><p>In regard to the rest of your belongings, whatever you need to keep to take care of your daily necessities does not have to be sold. Yet you must have the attitude that all of God's children can share all of these things with you. Let me tell you something about myself. You can take this as a joke. For about twenty years, I have had the habit of buying everything in quantity, half a dozen or a dozen at a time. Some brothers wonder why I always buy in quantity. For example, when I buy a pair of sunglasses, my intention is, of course, to use them. Yet I also pray, "God, since You intend to supply me with sunglasses, please supply me with six pairs." I do not have peace unless I pray this way. Then when a brother in need comes along, I give him a pair. If another brother comes along, I give him another pair. I give away five pairs and keep one for myself. In this way I keep my peace.</p><p>If I buy pocketknives, I always buy a dozen. If I buy razors, I always buy a case of twelve dozen. I do this because if I only buy one, it will have the flavor of doing something for myself. But if I give one to you when you come, and I give another to another brother when he comes, there is a much sweeter flavor to the whole purchase. Of course, I cannot give to a thousand or a million people. But by giving away a little, the flavor becomes different. If I buy a dozen pocketknives, and eleven brothers come to me, I can give each of them one. I can keep the last one, and God will probably give me the liberty to use it freely. If I do not do this, there will always be a nagging feeling that I am keeping something for myself. Those who have stayed with me for any length of time know what I am saying. Whenever I go shopping, I always buy in dozens. But I do not use in dozens. Once I let go of my possessions, there is a sweet flavor to whatever I do.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Practicing the Principle<br />of Having All Things in Common</h2><p>We should learn not to hold on tightly to our own possessions. I believe the Lord will not allow me to keep my coat forever. Perhaps tomorrow it will be gone. Since that is the case, I might as well ask the tailor to make a few more for me; then I can give some away. We should try our best to build up this feeling among us. Every time we shop, we should not plan for ourselves only. We should always think of others. We need to shop. I am not saying that we should not shop. But when we shop, we should cultivate this feeling, the flavor of having all things in common. I am not saying that we have to practice the very act of having all things in common. I am saying that we have to keep this principle. Always think of others. We must always uphold the principle of having all things in common.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Learning Not to Take Root<br />or to Be Stingy before God</h2><p>All new believers should learn this lesson before God. If we have special possessions or objects, we should sell them. All real estate, gold, or silver should be sold. We do not like to see believers owning gold, silver, properties, or houses. Such things always tempt us to take root in the earth.</p><p>Yet it is not enough to simply get rid of these things. Many people have sold their properties, but it is hard to borrow a fountain pen from them. It is not easy to be delivered from the world! There are many stingy men in this world. They are stingy, not only in the big things, but in the small things as well. They are stingy in every little item and every little detail.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Not Holding On to Anything, Always Letting Go</h2><p>Many times when I read Acts 2 and 4, I get the impression that our so-called real assets such as properties and houses must somehow be sold. The church did this then. Acts does not speak of many other things. Yet it does say that they had all things in common. No one held on to anything for himself. God's children should always let go of what they have when it comes to supplying other children of God. If we have any possession, we should either sell it or give it away to the poor. Our feeling should always be to share our possession with others, whether it is a knife or a pen. We should not keep anything for ourselves. Everything can go. If we do this, God will not allow us to go into poverty. In fact, He will multiply what we have.</p><h2 class="head2">H. The Pattern of the Early Church</h2><p>New believers should realize this principle. The early church practiced this. From the beginning, the twelve disciples told the Lord that they had abandoned all to follow Him. By the time of Pentecost, in the first revival, three thousand and five thousand spontaneously sold what they had. They were saved, and like Zaccheus, they did it without many teachings.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Selling All without Hearing<br />Much Teaching about It</h2><p>The twelve disciples did not hear many teachings before they forsook everything to follow the Lord. The Lord did not tell them to sell all that they had to follow Him. He only told them to follow Him (Matt. 4:19, 21). When the Lord called them, they spontaneously dropped everything. In the same way, the apostles did not tell the first group of three thousand people to sell all that they had. They sold all their possessions in a spontaneous way. Neither did the apostles tell the five thousand to sell all that they had; they did it spontaneously. Today we have to do the same. We have heard and believed in the gospel. We should do what the three thousand and five thousand did; they were also new believers. This is how the church goes on generation after generation. What a pity it would be for this "family tradition" to stop with us. We should always bring the church back to its original course.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. NOT BEING ABLE TO SERVE GOD<br />AND MAMMON AT THE SAME TIME</h2><p>Let us turn to Matthew 6, which shows us that our heart must be single in order to serve the Lord. We cannot serve God and mammon at the same time.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Mammon Being an Idol</h2><p>Mammon is an idol. We have served it for many years. It has imprisoned our heart for many years. Today if we are to serve the Lord, we have to make a choice between the two. We cannot serve God and mammon together. The Lord said, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (v. 21). A brother said to me once, "My treasures are on earth, but my heart is in heaven." I responded, "You are surely a museum piece, not of the London Museum, but of the `Christian Museum.' The Lord said that no one can do this, yet you have come up with something that is more miraculous than a miracle." The Lord said that where our treasure is, there will be our heart. The heart always follows the treasure. We cannot change this. No matter what we say, our heart will always be where our treasure is.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Learning to Serve God Alone</h2><p>If we lay up for ourselves treasures on earth, we will always be serving mammon and not God. It is true that we can keep some occupation and engage in some work of production. But everything that we have should be offered up to God. We have to live by the lowest possible standard of living. We cannot serve God and mammon together. Do we choose God or mammon? We have to choose between the two. The Lord said that it is not wise to choose mammon, because mammon rusts, and moths consume it (v. 19). The account in our bank may be getting bigger and bigger, but thieves will come and steal it away. We have to learn to serve God alone and to lay up our treasure in heaven.</p><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">IDENTIFYING HERESIES</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 11:13-15; 1 Tim. 6:20-21; 2 Tim. 4:3-4; 2 Pet. 2:1; Jude 3; Isa. 8:20</h1><p class="indent1">(The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling on September 28, 1948, as part of the "New Believers" series. It was later excluded from the final published version of the series.)</p><h2 class="head1">I. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Heresy is a big subject. We should give new believers a proper understanding of the subject so that they can build up a proper defense against it. We should read the verses above to new believers one by one, and then we should tell them that these verses show that many heretics will arise in the end times. These heretics come from within the church. Some will use the name of Christ to propagate their heretical teachings. Every Christian should be warned concerning the matter of heresy. Jude 3 says that we have to "earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints." We must be orthodox in our faith. We must help the new believers to choose the proper path. We should warn them concerning heresies. We have covered the subject of the pathway of the church. We said that only one church will keep the Lord's word and His name in the end times&mdash;the church in Philadelphia. Our eyes must be opened to find this church.</p><h2 class="head1">II. NOT BECOMING CURIOUS</h2><p>Many curious ones like to try different things. In the end they become poisoned by what they try. Curiosity brings nothing but poison to a person. God's children do not need to become involved in a heresy, only to find out later that it is a heresy and then condemn it. We do not need to be involved in heresy after heresy and condemn them one by one afterwards. As soon as we hear some strange thing, we should turn away from it. Some people like to try things out. In the end they fall into the very things they are trying. They are stumbled by them and cannot get out of them. This is dangerous. We should never be curious, lest we fall into heresies and become trapped by them. No heresy is one hundred percent heresy; every one is a mixture of heresy and truth. Satan would not be so foolish as to come up with something that is pure heresy. Most of the time heretical beliefs are mixed in with the best truths. When a man receives the truths, he takes in heresies at the same time. It is not easy for young believers to discern these heresies. We should learn to not touch heresies. We should flee from them and reject them. Only those who are sober will save themselves from danger; those who are curious will always suffer the poisonous sting.</p><h2 class="head1">III. STANDARD RULES TO IDENTIFY HERESIES</h2><p>No young Christian can deal with heresies. The best thing for a young Christian to do is to turn away from them altogether. But if you are in a place without a church or if you are alone, here are ten criteria for you to test whether a teaching is heretical. If any of the ten criteria fits the description or if a person teaches any of these ten things, you have a heresy. What determines a group as heretical or not is not the volume of teachings it produces, but the presence or absence of heresy. As long as there is heresy, the group is off. I would rather listen to a message with little truth but no heresy than to listen to one with much truth mixed up with a little heresy. A little poison can kill a person. In the same way, a little leaven can leaven the whole lump. Some of these heresies can only be identified by men with special gifts. It may appear easy to identify these heresies, but in reality it is not that simple. We need to ask if a teaching has a little heresy in it. If it does, we have to discard it even if the rest is good.</p><p>There are many kinds of heresies. Some heresies completely deny the Lord. Some stand on the ground of miracles, works of wonders, and divination. Some have to do with prophecies, some with questions related to judgment after death, and some with mortification of fleshly lusts. Furthermore, each kind of heresy is propagated by many different groups. There are many different kinds of heresies, and they are all different in their errors. But as long as they err in one thing, they constitute a heresy. However, we must have substantial evidence before we can call a teaching a heresy. Heresy is a strong word, and we must not condemn anyone as a heretic lightly. Now let us examine the ten things that determine a heresy.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Authority of the Bible</h2><p>The first kind of heresy relates to the authority of the Bible. Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed." Christian faith and conduct are based absolutely on the Bible. Isaiah 8:20 says, "To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because in them there is no dawn." The law and testimony spoken of in this verse is the Scripture. Everything has to be measured by the Bible. If anyone measures anything by another standard, he is preaching heresy. The most popular heresies today set up other things as standards. For example, some say that the church is the standard. Others say that the Bible sets the general standard, but that the church sets the specific standards. They put out many ordinances in addition to the Bible. We cannot have fellowship with any group that bases its teaching and judgment on any person or organization. Adding anything to the Scripture is heresy. Some have said that the Bible is right, but that they have received additional inspirations. This is surely a heresy. For example, in Shanghai a group of Bible students claim that a man must read their "Studies in the Scriptures" before he can know the Bible. These are the Russellites, otherwise known as Jehovah's Witnesses. They have other authorities in addition to God's Word. This is wrong. Consider the Christian Scientists. They claim that their words have the same standing as the Bible. Anyone who puts his word on the same level as the Bible is surely a heretic. A man can have no authority apart from the Bible. Some who believe in supernatural phenomena say that the Holy Spirit speaks through the Bible on the one hand, but that He also speaks independently through them on the other hand. They do not realize that God's revelation is one complete entity. All the revelations complement one another; there is no conflict between them. Any new speaking must complement the established revelations recorded in the Bible. Hence, anything that deviates from the Bible or elevates itself to a position of authority is a heresy.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Concerning the Person of Christ</h2><p>The second kind of heresy has to do with the person of Christ. Satan's greatest goal in introducing heresies is to attack the person of Christ. The Scripture shows us that the Lord Jesus Himself is God (John 1:1-3). Yet Satan wants men to deny that He is God. Concerning the person of Christ, the Bible shows us (1) that the Lord Jesus is God, (2) that He is the Son of God, (3) that He is the Christ appointed by God, (4) that He is a perfect man, and (5) that after His resurrection He is both God and man in heaven. At that time, God made Him both Lord and Christ. Some may ask, how can He be both man and God as well as the Son of God? They think that this is too confusing and that no one can know who Christ is. You can just tell them that the Bible says so. Christ also said that no man can know the Son except by the Father's revelation (Matt. 16:17). The Lord admitted that it is not easy to know His person. Heretics only acknowledge one aspect of the Lord's person; they do not acknowledge all the aspects. But to deny any one aspect of His person is enough to constitute a teaching as a heresy. Throughout the ages, many heresies have concentrated their attack on one or more aspects of the Lord Jesus' person. As long as one can annul one aspect of His person, he can annul the entire work of the Lord. For example, some people say that the Lord Jesus was not a man. This annuls His work of redemption through the blood. Some people say that He is not God. This annuls the power of His work in the remission of sins. Those who attack the person of Christ do not have to attack every aspect of His person; they only have to annul one aspect, and then they are more than qualified to be called a heretic.</p><p>Man has many kinds of misunderstandings about the Bible. Some of these misunderstandings are excusable, while others are inexcusable. Concerning the person of Christ, we have to be very strict in upholding its integrity. Although you may not understand many teachings about the person of Christ and may not be able to satisfactorily explain them, you have to acknowledge the facts. Most heresies concentrate their attacks on certain aspects of the person of Christ. This is Satan's ultimate goal. The apostle John pointed this out in his old age. If anyone says that Christ is one person while Jesus is another, he is preaching heresy. If anyone says that after the death and resurrection of Christ, there is only the Spirit and that Christ ceases to exist, he is likewise preaching heresy. If anyone says that God first created a "Word," that the Word was God's first creation, after which the Word created the heaven and earth and all the living creatures, he is preaching heresy. If anyone says that Christ is a Spirit subordinate to God and superior to the angels, who came to earth to be a man, he is preaching heresy. Some separate the Son of God from the man Jesus on earth. Some separate the man Jesus on earth from the resurrected and ascended Christ. Some deny that Jesus of Nazareth is now in heaven. Man uses two knives, one to cut off the Son of God from Jesus of Nazareth, the other to cut off the man Jesus from the resurrected and ascended Christ. Those who do this are preaching heresy. Satan loves to confuse the person of Christ. First John 3 says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil (v. 8). If a man does not recognize that Jesus the Son of God has come in the flesh, it means that he does not recognize the Lord's work in destroying the devil. Hence, those who destroy the person of Christ destroy God's plan.</p><p>Second John 7 says that "those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh" are deceivers. Man may believe that the earthly Jesus was a man, yet not believe that He was God coming in the flesh. This separates the Son of God from the earthly man. Verse 10 is a very serious word; it was spoken by one who was full of love: "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!" Verse 11 says, "For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works." Those who love the Lord must love and protect His person. First John 4:1 says, "Do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." Verse 2 is the same as 2 John 7, except it states the fact in another way. Verse 3, which is the same as 1 Corinthians 12:3, says, "Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God." To not confess Jesus means to not acknowledge Him as the Lord Jesus. Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh involves His history on earth, while His becoming the Lord involves His history in glory. God proclaimed Him Lord on the day of Pentecost. Jehovah's Witnesses claim that Jesus died and never resurrected. They say that three days after Jesus was crucified, "Christ Jesus the divine" was born. This is heresy; this is not merely a difference in interpretation. All those who break up the person of the Lord Jesus into different entities are heretics. The heretics always break up the one person of the Lord Jesus into different persons. Many heresies are aimed at destroying the person of our Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Concerning Man's Sin</h2><p>Some heresies try to deny the matter of sin altogether. The Bible clearly tells us that man has sinned. In saying that man has sinned, the Bible means two things. First, man has sinned in his conduct; this is sin in conduct. Second, man has sinned against God; this is sin before God. Both are sins in the Bible, and both are facts. Some people have more agreeable dispositions, yet they are still sinful before God. Any teaching that denies these two facts of sin is a heresy. Some have tried to prove man's sinlessness by philosophy. Others have tried to prove it by human physiological constitution. Christian Scientists as well as Russellites, or Jehovah's Witnesses, fall into this category of people. They are heretics. Saying that man has not sinned annuls the work of redemption and the need of a Savior. Saying this is the same as saying that the gospel we preach is a lie. All those who deny the fact of man's sinfulness are heretics.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Concerning Christ's Redemption</h2><p>The Bible clearly says that our sins are washed away by the blood of the Lord Jesus. The redemption of Christ is a biblical truth. There are two cardinal facts in the gospel of Christ. The first involves Christ's person, and the second involves His work. His work redeemed man through the shedding of His blood. The denial of either one of these two aspects is a denial of the gospel of Christ. Concerning the redemption of Christ, man's mind has been deceived by Satan into formulating many strange and devious teachings that lead to unimaginable results. Men try to overturn the work of the Lord. Some try to overturn it by overturning the reality of sin. They deny the fact of man's inherent sin. This nullifies the need of Christ's redemption. Others try to overturn the blood. They do not recognize the redemptive nature of Christ's blood. This also nullifies the work of Christ's redemption. Second Peter 2:1 speaks of those who deny the Master who bought them. This is surely heresy.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Concerning Eternal Judgment</h2><p>Some people believe in the person and work of the Lord Jesus. They believe in man's sinfulness and in Christ's redemption. But they overturn the fact of eternal judgment. They deny this by promulgating two kinds of teachings concerning death. First, they say that a man is simply sleeping when he dies. His body is asleep and his soul is also asleep. Neither the body nor the soul is conscious of anything anymore. When the Lord resurrects him, he will wake up once more. His death today is merely a gap in time. However, the Lord tells us that after a man dies, he is still conscious of many things. On the cross He told one of the thieves that he would be with Him in Paradise that very day. In Luke 16 the Lord relates the story of Lazarus and the rich man; both went to Hades after they died. Clearly they were conscious of many things. It is true that the Bible refers to man's death as a kind of sleep. But this refers only to man's body; man's soul has not gone to sleep. Men came up with this theory in order to reduce the consequences of sin. This is heresy. Second, there are those who say that the second death is not an eternal judgment but a total annihilation or perdition, in which a man ceases to exist entirely. Yet the word used in the Bible for destroy (Matt. 10:28) is the same as the word used for ruined in the bursting of the old wineskins (9:17). The wineskins are broken and ruined, but they are still around; they have not ceased to exist. Christ said that there are those who can kill the body but not the soul (10:28). He also said that in Gehenna the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched (Mark 9:48). A man in perdition is a man who suffers eternally in the lake of fire. This is God's Word. This proves that after a man dies, he does not cease to exist. For any man to nullify the second death is for him to preach heresy. Such preaching does not honor the redemptive work of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Concerning Miracles and Healing</h2><p>The Bible records many miracles and works of wonders. Many such miracles are related to the healing of sicknesses. These are signs used by God. But many heresies in this world attract men by miracles and works of wonders. The Lord prophesied that before His coming again, many miracles would appear to deceive men (Matt. 24:24). A big part of heretical teachings involves the healing of sicknesses. These heresies attract men by their power of healing. We have to be careful about all forms of healing and supernatural phenomena. The miracles and supernatural events in the Bible were initiated by the Holy Spirit through the hands of men. The Holy Spirit acknowledges Jesus as the Lord; He testifies for the Lord. There is nothing wrong for a man who has faith, who has a word from God, and who believes in such a word to pray and anoint sick ones in the name of the Lord. But some miracle workers in some heretical groups do not believe in sickness and death at all. They say that both sickness and death are lies. But it is interesting that they themselves also die. Christian Scientists do not believe in aging, sickness, or death. After Mary Baker Eddy died, a scandal developed. Her will instructed that a certain sum of money be given to her followers. Yet her followers insisted before a judge that she had not died. The judge considered this to be absurd, because if she had not died, the will could not go into effect, and the church could not claim her inheritance. Yet if she had died, it would disprove her teaching about the absence of sickness, pain, sin, and death. We should not be too obsessed with healing and miraculous things. Sickness is a fact. Some sicknesses are the result of natural laws. Some sicknesses are the result of attacks from Satan. Some sicknesses are the result of sin. On the one hand, we believe in the existence of sickness and death. On the other hand, we also believe in supernatural acts as the free manifestation of the work of the Holy Spirit, who always acknowledges Christ Jesus as Lord. But we should also realize that the world likes to believe in strange and inexplicable things. We should exercise our care in discerning these things.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Concerning Prophecies</h2><p>Many people believe that the Lord will come again. But the Lord told us that no one knows the day of His coming, not even the angels or the Son of Man Himself. This is a basic principle concerning the day of Christ's coming. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Christ came in 1874. The founder of the group, Charles T. Russell, preached this, and his follower Joseph Rutherford continued this. The strange thing is that even though they claimed that they saw the coming of the Lord, we do not see it. They say that we are already in the millennium and that this is the reason for all the wonderful inventions like the typewriter, the telephone, and the automobile. Some also believe that the Lord Jesus entered the Holy of Holies in heaven in 1844. Others say that Christ came in 1918. Two places in the Bible speak of a day as a year: Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6. Some base their arguments on these verses and postulate that a day signifies a year in every prophecy. But God only said that in certain particular things a day is like a year. He did not say that this is true for all things. It is wrong to calculate the day of Christ's coming according to this "day-year theory." The seventy weeks in the book of Daniel may fit the "day-year theory." But other than that, all other days should be considered merely as days. If a person says that a day is always a year, then the millennium would be a period of three hundred and sixty thousand years. Some would then argue that a day, being short, can be interpreted as a long year, but that a year, being so long, is a long enough period, and there is no need for further interpretation. It is tiresome to argue about these things, and we do not have to bother ourselves with them. All those who predict the day of Christ's return based on the "day-year" theory are in danger of being heretical.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Communication<br />between the Living and the Dead</h2><p>According to Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and Leviticus 20:6, God strictly forbids the living to communicate with the dead. In the Gospel of Luke, the Lord spoke about the rich man in Hades, who implored the Lord to send Lazarus to the land of the living, yet the Lord would not do it. Dead people are in Hades or in Paradise, and they cannot return to the land of the living. For a dead man to return to the land of the living or for the living to communicate with the dead is to engage in divination. The Bible strictly forbids this.</p><p>A diviner or a witch is a woman who communicates with demons. A woman can actually be acquainted with only one demon. Such a woman is familiar with evil spirits. In divination a demon pretends to be the spirit of many dead persons. The one with whom a diviner communicates is not actually the spirit of the dead person, but the demon himself. In the Bible only 1 Samuel speaks of a spirit coming up from Hades. After Samuel died, his spirit was called up, and he rebuked Saul (1 Sam. 28). The one place that speaks of the reason for Saul's death is 1 Chronicles 10:13-14, which says that Saul died because he took counsel from one who had a familiar spirit. The laws of Moses forbade a woman from communicating with spirits, and those who did so were to be stoned to death. Anyone who engages in divination is a heretic.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Concerning Women Teaching</h2><p>First Timothy 2, 1 Corinthians 14, and Revelation 2 all show that God forbids a woman from teaching. Any sect that is started by a woman or headed up by one, or any group in which the woman occupies the same place as the man is highly suspicious. More than half of the heresies in the world have been started by women. For example, the founder of the Christian Scientists was Mary Baker Eddy, and the founder of the Seventh-day Adventists was Mrs. White. When the Bible speaks about Roman Catholicism, it also refers to the teaching of the woman Jezebel.</p><h2 class="head2">J. Concerning the Lord's Coming</h2><p>The principle of heresy is a Satanic imitation of what the Lord is doing. For example, the Lord heals sicknesses. Satan also heals sicknesses. Concerning the Lord's coming, heresies try to confuse men. For example, some claim that the Lord will come on a certain day in a certain place. When the Lord does not come as predicted, men begin to ignore or despise the very truth concerning the Lord's second coming. Satan likes to smear the truth concerning the Lord's coming with such infamous incidents. It is true that the Lord is coming soon, and many people will pay more attention to prophecies in the future. For this reason, more heresies will be found in the area of prophecies. If any sect or group claims that it is waiting for the Lord to return on a certain date in a certain place, you can tell immediately that this is a heretical group. If anyone claims that he is one of the two witnesses, or one of the three angels, do not believe him. If anyone claims to be a certain person described in the Bible, do not trust him. The Lord says that one day men will claim, "Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here!" (Matt. 24:23). Do not believe them. These are lies.</p><p>We should not put our trust in anything. The only thing we should pursue is to be the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3. Others may say that they are certain persons described in the book of Revelation or the book of Daniel. They are heretics, and we should not receive them. In the end times heresies will increase. This is why we have to discern. Do not be curious to try them out. Such curiosity will always cause damage to our spirit. If we try them out, we are tasting poison. If anyone does not pass any of the above ten tests, he is a heretic, and we must not have any fellowship with him. These teachings are rising up day by day in China, and we have to be on the alert against them.</p></body></html>
