   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MEETING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament you have a collective people typifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the primary things this people should impress us with is the matter of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning from the night of the Passover they continued to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They had the Passover in their houses, but I don t consider that as a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in a sense it was a kind of home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there was no individual Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Passover was not held by individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was held by houses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Passover Lamb was not killed for any individual, but for the houses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then continuing that Passover they were gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were gathered to be an army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Right after the Passover they began to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So they needed to be formed into an army, and that formation into an army was their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Right after the Passover all the children of Israel became a meeting people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They met, not only every day, but all day and all night.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You might ask, How could we meet like this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if you read Acts 2 and 4 there was this kind of atmosphere or at least this kind of aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three thousand and the five thousand, after being saved, had the aspiration, I believe, to stay together day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once again I say that one of the primary things the children of Israel did that should impress us is their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They became a meeting people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was through that meeting that God did everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did nothing outside of their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did nothing without that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did everything through that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PEOPLE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have to realize that those people who were there meeting together were a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is a people meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the ekklesia, a people called out to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose there is no meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where then is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is no meeting, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is just the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is not only the meeting people, but the people meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meeting people may not meet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when the people are meeting, surely everybody is in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>SCATTERED INTO CAPTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose we don t come together anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose we are dismissed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dismissed is a good word, but we don t like the word scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the church is scattered it means the church is in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When so many saints miss the meetings I wonder whether they have been dismissed or scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have been dismissed, that is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if you have been scattered, that means you are captured.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I don t like to offend you, but I must be frank and honest to tell you the truth: if you don t come to the church meeting, you are in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have missed the meeting very few times within the past twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I was not in the meeting I had the feeling that I was left in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was not one time when the church was meeting and I was not in the meeting that I had a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I cannot say that the church was meeting and I stayed home and had a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot say how pleasant it is that while the church is meeting I am staying home.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is your feeling when you stay home from the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Captivity!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have not been properly dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have been captured.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You are in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must see what is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is not just a meeting people; it is a people meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A MEETING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In a recent meeting with the sisters I said that human life is vanity and that the Christian life is meaningless without the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then what kind of life is meaningful?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is neither the human life nor in a sense the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are millions of Christians today on the earth, but many of them do not have a meaningful life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are Christians, yet still their Christian life is meaningless because they don t have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now I must add that the church life is just a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Christian life needs the church life, and the church life is a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Your human life is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Your Christian life needs the church life, and your church life must be a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you don t meet, you don t have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you don t have the church life, your Christian life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you want to have a life full of reality you must be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But even as a Christian you cannot by yourself reach the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yes, Christ is reality, but this reality could only be reached and experienced in full in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you don t have the church life, you don t have the reality of the riches of Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ can never be touched and experienced adequately unless you are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>So if you don t have the church life your Christian life is aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is no goal, no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The purpose, the goal, the aim of the Christian life is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>And you have to realize that the church is a people meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The church life is just a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There can be no argument.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The fact is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Don t tell me that you have been a Christian for years and that you do not meet with people often.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Don t tell me that you stay home by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I would say you are a poor Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I am an enjoying Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I enjoy Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I experience Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>By meeting with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>No one could call me a poor Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I enjoy the Lord Jesus all the time with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I would illustrate once again with the wedding day.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The wedding day is supposed to be the most pleasant day.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>On the one hand my wedding day was very pleasant but compared with the meeting days, there was a different flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>On a pleasant meeting day there is only honey.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is not a bit of vinegar.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But many times on the wedding day there is not only honey but also vinegar.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The wedding joy couldn t last as long as the meeting joy.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In 1942 and 1943 we had a big revival and even tonight when I have a little recollection of these meetings I am so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When I think about the meetings in Elden hall in 1969 and 1970, my!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I am so happy.</S>
