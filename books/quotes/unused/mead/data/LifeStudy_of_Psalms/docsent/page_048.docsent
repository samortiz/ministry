   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Pit That They Made</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David said that the nations have sunk in the pit that they made; their own foot is caught in the net that they hid; the wicked have been snared in their own work; and all the nations who forget God will be turned back to Sheol Psa 9:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems these ones were in Sheol, Hades, already.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was as if David said, "God, You have to tell the nations that they are mortal men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since they are mortal, they cannot prevail against me because I am under Your care; so look on my affliction."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But what about David's sins?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His wife at that time was actually the wife of the one whom he murdered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One thousand years later, when Matthew wrote the genealogy of Christ, he said, "David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" 1:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David prayed, but God did not answer absolutely according to what he prayed, so that bothered him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was as if David asked God, "Why do You hide Yourself when I need You in times of distress?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that the more I cry out to You, the more You disappear."</S>
