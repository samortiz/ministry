   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Progression and Peak of</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Divine Revelation concerning the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 1 speaks of God s creation and says that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters v. 2 . Other portions of the Old Testament also refer to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They say that the Spirit of Jehovah came upon a person and that the Spirit of Jehovah caused people to prophesy Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3:10; 1 Sam 10:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament speaks of the Holy Spirit before the birth of the Lord Jesus, saying that the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, and she conceived of the Holy Spirit Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament also speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , that is, the Spirit of the incarnated and crucified Savior, and it speaks of the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These titles are according to the divine revelation concerning the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All theologians agree that the divine revelation did not develop in a quick way; rather, it developed gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The development of the truth can be compared to the sun rising at dawn and shining brighter and brighter until it reaches its zenith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The revelation concerning the Holy Spirit reaches its zenith in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis is the dawning of the divine revelation, after which the divine revelation gradually shines brighter until it reaches its zenith in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say that in the book of Revelation the divine revelation reaches high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Revelation, however, was not yet recognized when the Council of Nicaea was held.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in relation to the divine revelation, the Council of Nicaea did not define its creed at noontime but only at about ten o clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This creed lacks the revelation contained in Revelation and in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without these two precious books, the Bible has two large holes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two books, however, were not recognized at the time of the Council of Nicaea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Creed instituted by this Council was not perfect or complete, because the divine revelation had not arrived at noon, at its zenith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the time I went to America more than twenty years ago, I had received much light from the Lord concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christianity in America had not seen the light that I had received, and many theologians could not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were very uncomfortable after they heard me speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people exhorted me in love to not speak these things in America, because the Christians here could not receive what I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They said that even though the Bible contains these matters, the people could not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I responded that if I did not speak these things, I would have nothing to say, and there would be no need for me to be in America.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was no need for me to speak other things, because there are many pastors and theologians in America.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord had revealed many things to me; hence, I had a definite burden in coming to America.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I must overcome all criticism and do my best to speak what I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I must also print my messages in books.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the summer of 1969 we held a conference in Ohio.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the conference I received a burden from the Lord to speak concerning the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the first time I released a message on the seven Spirits, and everyone was shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the messages were printed, the word and the light concerning the seven Spirits silenced the Christians in America who formerly disagreed with my speaking on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christians showed us the Nicene Creed, we explained that the Nicene Creed was incomplete and fell short of the divine revelation because it was written in A.D. 325 before Revelation and Hebrews were recognized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After this explanation the Christians did not have anything more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Emphasizing Education with Truth Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to receive the education in Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every volume of Truth Lessons contains twelve to twenty detailed lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us consider lesson 14 in Volume 2 of Level 1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This lesson is on the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It presents the five prophets before the age of the prophets four in Judah and one Gentile and the prophets that were raised up during the age of the prophets, including the twelve minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not easy to memorize the order of the twelve minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we should study the important points of their prophecies concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if we forget these important points, by carefully studying these books, the riches will be deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, instead of being discouraged, we should persevere with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our laboring in the truth can be compared to completing a four-year curriculum at a university.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The speech, attitude, and expressions of a person who graduates from a university are different from those of a person who never attended a university.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We hope the brothers and sisters will labor diligently in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we came to Taiwan more than thirty years ago, the outward circumstances were very discouraging because the people were backward in both their speech and dress.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The situation now is completely different because the government has worked hard, and there are many college students.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone has developed their intellect and potential because they have received a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This has made the economy robust and the society wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same principle, if the Lord s testimony is to have a way on earth, we must be educated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a gradual process to be educated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Outwardly it seems as if there is no revival, but things are very solid inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are doing the work of the Lord s recovery, not a work of excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a work of life in which we help the saints grow in life, and it is a work of truth in which the saints are cultivated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church in Taipei has definitely been doing quite well in these two aspects.</S>
