   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Receiving the Word in Spirit to Be Washed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Water in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 25 through 27 say, Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 26 speaks of the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by this washing that the church is sanctified and cleansed, and all the spots and the wrinkles are purged away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church life today stains and dirtiness do not cause much damage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not matter if my hand is dirty or has paint on it, because I can wash this away in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, spots are something of the natural life, and wrinkles are related to oldness, so not even the best soap can wash them away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today the enemy causes many spots and wrinkles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does his best to cause a great amount of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been meeting together for only two and a half years, but some may already have become old.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing but the inner life can deal with all these spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sanctifying and cleansing are a matter of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The washing of the water in the word is a matter of the life ministered to us by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the word of God there is always the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are in spirit and reading the word, the word ministers life to us, and this life is the water that washes away all the spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we take the word by our spirit, it becomes life, and this life is the washing water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word can be life to us only when it is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 6:63 the Lord said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the word is received in our spirit, it becomes spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then it ministers life to us, and this life within is the washing water, sanctifying and cleansing us of all the spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All this is a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have a problem with a brother, we can never solve it by talking and reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may think that we should clear up the misunderstanding, but the more we try to clear it up by talking about it, the more complicated it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can never explain anything clearly enough once a problem occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, that is the human concept, even the temptation from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only way out of this situation is to forget about our reasoning and turn from our natural mentality in the soul to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the spirit will work something out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we are in the mentality, reasoning, arguing, and trying to convince others, the Lord s word will not be life to us when we read it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how many chapters we read, there will be no life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only when we turn to the spirit and then come to the word that we receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the way to help others is to help them to turn from their mind to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone comes to us to reason and argue, we may be tempted to convince him by our own reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do this, we will be trapped by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the natural, wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to learn the lesson how to help this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we realize that he is in his mind, we should help him to turn from his mind to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he turns to the spirit and then comes back to the word, the word will give life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then this life will wash away the spots and the wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spots and wrinkles can be washed away only by life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way the church will be sanctified and cleansed from all spots and wrinkles because all death will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the church will be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This again is something in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TO FIGHT THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 10 and 11 of Ephesians 6 say, Finally, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then verse 18 says, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The last aspect in Ephesians is the spiritual warfare, and the key, the secret, of this warfare is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to know how to pray in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is a problem among the saints, we should not deal with it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, we must learn to pray in spirit to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is by means of all prayer and petition in spirit, not by talking and reasoning, that the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Being Strengthened in the Spirit and</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Avoiding the Temptation to Listen to Problems</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to pray in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we confront a difficult situation, we should keep ourselves entirely away from the problems there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if people come to tell us the problems, we should shut our ears and not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, again there is the natural temptation to dig out all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we go to a certain locality, we may like to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a real temptation, and it is no help to ourselves or to the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we become deaf, blind, and dumb in a situation, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our spirit needs to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If it is, there will be no need for anyone to tell us the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may not know the details, but in our spirit we will know the situation in principle.</S>
