   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE HEAVENLY CALLING OF PAUL Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-15; 26:13-19; Gal 1:11-17; 2:20; 3:27; 4:19; Col 1:24-29 THE NEED FOR PAUL S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without Paul s completing ministry, there is no way for Christ s heavenly ministry to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, without Christ s heavenly ministry Paul s ministry would have no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two ministries work together the one in the heavens and the other within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s ministry reflected what Christ was ministering in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s heavenly ministry began in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Between chapters two and nine Christ s ministry was proceeding, but Paul s had not yet begun.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something was missing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, Peter was ministering, but if we compare his ministry with Paul s, we shall sense a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts 9 the story of Paul s momentous conversion is recorded, a conversion that was brought about, not by any human being, but by the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A CALLING FROM THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Hebrews 3:1 Paul calls the Hebrews to whom he was writing partakers of a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word heavenly shows that Paul s calling was specific.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those Hebrews were companions in receiving the heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was not a calling on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consider, in contrast to Paul, how Peter was called.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter was at the Sea of Galilee, fishing with his brother, when a Man from Nazareth came by and called them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men, the Lord Jesus told them Matt 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How much I loved this story when I was young!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I longed also to be a fisher of men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much better to be a fisher of men rather than a fisher of fish!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After we consider Paul s calling, however, we shall see that there is no comparison between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter s calling was marvelous, but it was simple and from this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That call is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul s calling, on the other hand, is beyond our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The call to Saul of Tarsus came from the heavens, not from the Jesus on this earth, but from the ascended, glorified One in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Saul of Tarsus was one of a strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was happily nearing the end of his journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, eager to arrive and fulfill his task of arresting all those who believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was midday as he approached Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about him Acts 22:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? v. 7 . He must have thought, What do you mean? I have been persecuting Peter, and John, and Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But all those whom I have persecuted were on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have never harmed anyone in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who can this be, saying that I am persecuting him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So he asked.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Calling this unseen One Lord, he said, Who art thou, Lord? v. 8 . The answer came, I am Jesus! Saul must have been filled with consternation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus was crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How could He be speaking from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could He be alive?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such was the calling of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s completing ministry is to tell us that God is through with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Religion is an enemy to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have you ever heard the gospel preached with this as its message?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have no doubt heard that God condemns you because of your sinfulness and worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Have you ever been told that you must get out of religion? that religion is God s enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What you have heard as the gospel is not the completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The gospel pertains not merely to sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What God wants is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants His Son revealed in you Gal 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the time of Saul s calling he was not gambling nor cheating others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was an upright, honest man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He could say of himself, As to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless Phil 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Saul was altogether in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He needed to be rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He needed revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why did the Lord Jesus come to preach the gospel directly to Saul?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter, James, and John all knew how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their preaching, however, was to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They would not have known how to preach the gospel to such a zealous religionist as Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What was the gospel message Saul heard from the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A light from heaven first made him fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then a voice asked, Why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When Saul replied, Who are You, Lord? the voice answered, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Could Peter have preached such a gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only Christ Himself could.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In his own sight Saul of Tarsus was not sinful or against God; he was zealous for God and righteous according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet actually he was against God and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God s economy is that we forsake the law and religion and have His Son revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At the time when Saul was called, however, Peter did not clearly realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>John and James did not know this in a full way either.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus the Lord Jesus Himself had to touch Saul directly.</S>
