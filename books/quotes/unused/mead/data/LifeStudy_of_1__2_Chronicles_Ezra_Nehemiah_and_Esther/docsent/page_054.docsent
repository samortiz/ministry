   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF GOD S ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will begin to consider the reconstitution of the nation of God s elect chs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>8 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Coming Back to God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>by Coming Back to His Law, His Word</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to be reconstituted, we need to come back to God by coming back to His law, that is, His word ch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose a fallen person wants to come back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he would come back to God, he must come back to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one can come back to God without coming back to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s word reconstitutes us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have our own kind of disposition and habitual behavior, but God is able to reconstitute us through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why we need to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s word gradually changes our mind and our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word of God is one with the Spirit Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the word of God works within us, the Spirit, through the word, spontaneously dispenses God s nature with God s element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may not even be aware that such a dispensing is taking place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this way we are reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most of those who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon had been born not in Israel but in Babylon, and they were raised in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Babylonian element had been wrought into them and constituted into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, after they returned to the land of their fathers to be citizens of the nation of Israel, they needed a reconstitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ezra was very useful at this point, for he was one through whom the people could be reconstituted with the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The constitution of a person provides the foundation for the constitution of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A proper nation is not merely an organization but also a constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is especially true of a nation s army.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The army of the United States, for example, is constituted with many elements, and these elements afford the way for the individual soldiers to be reconstituted as parts of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the army is a constitution and not merely an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s intention with Israel was to have on earth a divinely constituted people to be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for God s people to be His testimony, they had to be reconstituted with the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under Ezra and Nehemiah the returned people of Israel were collectively constituted by and with God through His word to be a nation as God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the People of Israel Gathering as One Man and Telling Ezra to Bring the Book of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>of Moses and Read to Them</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Nehemiah 8:1-8 all the people of Israel gathered as one man before the Water Gate and told Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses and read to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ezra did it and blessed Jehovah the great God, and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, lifting up their hands; and they worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that rebellious Israel had been fully convinced and fully subdued by the word of God spoken through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word of God is the solid base for the Spirit of God, who is God Himself, to dispense God s element into our being to cause us to be constituted with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This should be our personal experience day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we come together, we then need to read even more of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To do this is to come together according to the way of the divine constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to be reconstituted, we need to read the sixty-six books of the Bible again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As one who has been reading the Word for more than sixty-five years, I can testify that I have been reconstituted through the daily reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every day I am reconstituted a little more.</S>
