   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-16:"For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And they went.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They said to him, Because no one has hired us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said to them, You also go into the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they themselves also received each a denarius.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And when they received it, they murmured against the householder, saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Take what is yours and go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or is your eye evil because I am good?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus shall the last be first and the first last."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This parable and the parable at the end of chapter eighteen are the most difficult ones to expound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot expound them in detail but can only find out from them the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First we have "a man, who is a householder" similar to the king in chapter eighteen .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The part that has to do with man cannot be explained; only the part that has to do with God can be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the hiring of workers is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God never hires any worker.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, what does the denarius a day refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then there is the murmuring who as God's worker dares to murmur before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, concerning this kind of parable, only the principles can be applied and not the details.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 30 of chapter nineteen should be included as the first verse of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Notice that the division of the chapters and verses in the Bible was made not according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 30 is similar to verse 16 of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord needed to deal with two things in answering Peter's question: 1 to express agreement by saying that one who has forsaken all for the Lord will receive a reward, and 2 to deal with Peter's wrong attitude his self-righteousness, his commercial mentality, and his working for reward and not out of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 28-29 of chapter nineteen deal with the first matter, while 19:30 20:16 deal with Peter's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has the final authority and is not restricted by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why in this parable the emphasis is on the sovereign authority of God and the fact that reward is according to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some have suggested that this parable refers to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is wrong, because salvation was accomplished by the Lord and is not gained through work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The householder here is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the early-morning shift, the first shift, God set the wages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the second shift the third hour , "whatever is right I will give you"; no agreement was made.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same is true for both the third shift the sixth hour and the fourth shift the ninth hour .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the fifth shift the eleventh hour , the reward was not even mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The crucial point here is that the law does not come in. "Early in the morning" refers to one's youth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"A day" refers to a person's whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ones hired in the eleventh hour had been standing idle since early morning because they were not called until then.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, there are people who began to work for God when they were thirty years old, and there are some who began when they were forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 8 mentions that while giving the wages in the evening, they were given first to the laborers hired in the eleventh hour.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it had been the other way around, the ones working from the earliest hour would have received their wages first and would not have seen the reward of the later ones and would not have murmured against the householder.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If that were the case, the Lord would not have been able to bring out the teaching of this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the time of the reward, there will still be grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a man deserves a dime and only eight cents is given, that is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only grace can give the same reward to those who do not work as long as others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the Lord was saying, "Peter, you should not be self-boasting and self-righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In everything you have tried to be one step ahead of others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet my reward the throne did not shortchange you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has the right to give to the latecomers, who sacrifice less, the same reward as He gives to you."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through this the Lord destroyed Peter's concept of legality and commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter had altogether forgotten God's grace and God's right.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God cannot exercise His right to do unrighteous things; yet He can exercise His right to bestow grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who emphasize reward too much will forget the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is why, after the Lord's resurrection, He asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After that He said "Feed My sheep," which means to labor John 21:15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is a slight difference between the conclusions in Matthew 19:30 and 20:16.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The "many" in 19:30 is more broad; it refers to Christians in general, probably including us and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"The last" in verse 16 refers specifically to the eleventh hour laborers in the parable.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The laborers were murmuring and had forgotten the things mentioned in Romans 9:14-15, 20.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The eleventh hour laborers who received a denarius surely had thankful hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, the Lord's teaching is to remind us that we are those who begin working at the eleventh hour.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One must forget what he has forsaken for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way he will receive his denarius with satisfaction and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, he will only remember his own sacrifices; he will not be satisfied with a denarius and will be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is only a teaching; it does not mean that God is actually an employer, or that the laborers actually receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>With the actual reward there is a difference between ten cities and five cities, and such a reward is given only in the millennium.</S>
