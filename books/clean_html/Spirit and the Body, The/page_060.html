<P>When anyone comes to you with a negative, opposing attitude, do not touch the points he raises right away, because at that time the opposer is on fire. If you touch the points of opposition, you will be burned. Instead of touching the points, slow down, cool down, and prepare the way for a second contact. Do not be in a rush to solve all the problems. The more you attempt to solve the problems, the more trouble you will cause. After you have taken down all the points, pray about them and see if you have the answers for them. If not, fellowship with other brothers and sisters. In this way you will find the answer and learn something yourself. Then try to have another time with the opposing one. But do not tell him you have all the answers. Rather, in a gradual way, item by item, solve his problems by injecting something into him. Human beings are human beings. By God's creation, every human being has a conscience and a sense of fairness. If you are genuine, honest, faithful, and nice, the other party will appreciate you. If you present matters solidly, rightly, and fairly, the opposer's sense of fairness will confirm what you say, and something will get into him. But do not expect immediate results. A fisherman must be patient. Hasty fishermen catch nothing; they only frighten the fish.</P><P>Even from the opposition we should be able to gain some increase. Do you not believe that you can bring in one opposer yearly? This means, of course, that we must labor. If we do not labor, we shall not bring in anything, even if we wait until eternity. Some of you may feel that you have no contacts, but you may know some opposers. The opposers are the best contacts. There is no need for you to go to them for they will come to you. All the opposers are like fish who come to a fisherman and say, "Here I am, ready to be hooked." But you may not believe that the opposers can be hooked. Because you may think that they are enemies and attackers, you may not appreciate them. I beg you to change your concept and begin to appreciate every opposer. When an opposer comes to you, you should say inwardly, "Praise the Lord, a good fish has come." But do not try to hook him right away. Rather, in wisdom, bind the opposer secretly. Hold on to a secret line that will not let him go. The problems he raises are the bait. The more questions he asks and the more problems he raises, the more free bait you will have. Take the problems and questions home, cook the bait, and bring it back to the fish the second time. Then the fish will swallow it. But still do not hook him too quickly. If you do so, you will lose him. Actually, you do not need to hook him, for he will be happy to swallow the hook. And when he gets hooked, he will be glad. I hope that a year from now many of us will be able to praise the Lord that we have caught an opposer. If we all do this, the opposers will be terrified and say, "Don't touch those people."</P><P>Do not think that I am too idealistic. This has actually happened in Fullerton, a city near Anaheim. The brothers and sisters there have gained the victory by taking down the questions raised by the opposers, by studying them, and by going back to talk to them. The truth is the truth. We have the case, and the truth is on our side. Thus, we are not afraid to be opposed. If we have real gold, we should not be afraid for that gold to be tested. The more the gold is tested, the more its golden nature is manifest.</P><P>We need to practice all the points covered in this message. If we practice them, we shall gain a good increase.</P>
