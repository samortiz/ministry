   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two Hundred Pomegranates</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 20 says, "And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah for the two hundred pomegranates!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Around each capital was a projection, like a belly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Encompassing the projection on each capital were two rows of a hundred pomegranates each.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates two times of a hundredfold expression of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you contact these elders who daily bear the responsibility in the intermixed and complicated situation, you will see that they express pomegranates, the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the complaints, dissatisfactions, and troubling telephone calls eventually form a projection full of pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>jj.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Capitals Being Four Cubits in Diameter</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The diameter of each of the capitals is four cubits 1 Kings 7:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the number twelve, the circumference of the pillars, is composed of four times three.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While the circumference of the pillar is twelve cubits, the diameter of the capitals is four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This implies that the pillars with their capitals are the number four, that is, the creatures, human beings, but that they are multiplied by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being mingled with the Triune God, they eventually become the number twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you put all this together, you will see that it is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It implies that those who judge and condemn themselves and count themselves as nothing will be able to bear the responsibility in full in the midst of a complicated situation because they do not live by themselves but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, they do not express their capability, qualification, intelligence, understanding, and wisdom they express pomegranates, the riches of life two-hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>kk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two Pillars Standing in the Porch of the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, we are told that the names of these two pillars were Jachin and Boaz 1 Kings 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jachin means, "He shall establish," and Boaz means, "In it is strength."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two pillars standing on the porch testify that the Lord will establish His building and that genuine strength is in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even today, the building of the church gives this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the details of the picture in 1 Kings 7, we see how we can be a pillar in the building of God, judging ourselves, living by faith, bearing the responsibility, and expressing the riches of life.</S>
