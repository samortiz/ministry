<h2 class="head2">B. What a Man Sows, That He Reaps</h2>
<p>Many portions in the Bible point out similar things. For example, Galatians 6:7 says, &ldquo;Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.&rdquo; This speaks of God&rsquo;s governmental hand. If a father spoils his children, his children will not grow up in a proper way. A father who does not care for his own family will end up with a tragedy. This is the only possible result. A person who always argues and fights with others and who holds different opinions will have no friends. What a man sows, that he reaps. This is God&rsquo;s government, God&rsquo;s ordained law. No one can change such a law. God&rsquo;s children must be careful not to provoke His governmental hand. It is not easy for God to remove His hand once it is provoked.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Lord&rsquo;s Healing of a Paralytic Being<br />
a Governmental Forgiveness</h2>
<p>A certain paralytic was carried to the Lord in the presence of the scribes. The Lord Jesus said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven&rdquo; (Matt. 9:2). If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying. The paralytic did not express his belief; it was others who bore him on a bed to the Lord. Yet the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.&rdquo; Does this mean that the paralytic was saved when he was carried to the Lord? If he were, salvation would have been too easy. One would only have to be carried to the Lord, and his sins would be forgiven. No, this certainly does not refer to eternal forgiveness. It has nothing to do with instrumental forgiveness or even forgiveness in fellowship. This is another kind of forgiveness. The Lord shows us two things here. On the one hand, the paralytic&rsquo;s sins were forgiven. On the other hand, he had to rise and pick up his mat and walk. Please bear in mind that many sicknesses are the result of God&rsquo;s governmental hand. In order for the paralytic to be healed and to rise again, he first needed to receive governmental forgiveness. Such forgiveness is related to God&rsquo;s government. It is related to sicknesses, not to eternal life. When others carried the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, His forgiveness clearly related to the sickness of paralysis. This man came to the Lord to be healed, and the Lord Jesus said that his sins were forgiven. In other words, his sickness would be healed once his sins were forgiven. His sickness was related to his sins. The Lord Jesus said such a word because the sickness was the result of the man&rsquo;s sins before God. He was sick because he had not settled the issue of his sins yet. When this issue was settled, his sickness was gone. This is governmental forgiveness. Sickness goes away when governmental forgiveness comes. Such a sin clearly involved a governmental offense. The man was sick because he had done something which had offended God&rsquo;s government. Once the Lord forgave him of his sins, he could rise, pick up his mat, and go home. This forgiveness is different from the other kinds of forgiveness. It is the forgiveness which enables one to pick up his mat and go home. This is governmental forgiveness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Elders of the Church<br />
Anointing the Sick and Praying for Them<br />
to Receive Governmental Forgiveness</h2>
<p>James 5:14-15 says, &ldquo;Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.&rdquo; This seems to be a very special kind of forgiveness. Here was a brother who was sick. The elders of the church were invited to anoint him with oil and pray for him, and the prayer of faith would cause the sick to rise up. If he had committed any sin, it would be forgiven him. We have seen that sickness may be caused by many factors. Some sicknesses may not be the result of sin, but some are. The sin here is not forgiven through the confession of the sick one; it is forgiven through the prayer of the elders of the church. Why are his sins forgiven after the elders of the church pray for him and apply the anointing to him? What sins are spoken of in this verse? One cannot apply such a method to eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, or forgiveness in fellowship. I believe that this is related to God&rsquo;s government. Suppose a brother is sick because of God&rsquo;s governmental hand. He has sinned and has fallen, and God is disciplining him. Although he has confessed his sins and has been forgiven and restored to fellowship, God&rsquo;s disciplining hand has not been lifted. He has to wait for the elders of the church to come to him and make petition on his behalf, saying, &ldquo;The brothers have forgiven his sins. We expect to see him rise up again. The church would like to see such a brother being recovered to the flow of life. Therefore, we anoint his body with oil that the ointment of the Head may flow to him once more.&rdquo; When the church does this to the sick one, he will be restored. In many cases, a person may have sinned and offended God&rsquo;s government. As soon as God removes His governmental hand from such a person, his sickness will be healed. When God removes His governmental hand, we have the fulfillment of the word, &ldquo;If he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.&rdquo; This sin is different from other ordinary sins. In our reading of the Bible, we must realize that James 5 is a chapter on governmental forgiveness. If we fall under God&rsquo;s governmental hand, He will not let us go until we are fully forgiven.</p>
