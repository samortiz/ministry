   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH A Mystery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is a mystery Eph 3:4; 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This mystery was in the Triune God, in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With the believers there is also an amount of mystery, but not as much as with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; whereas the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine mystery is much more with the church corporately than with the saints individually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is a corporate unit which is produced out of Christ who is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This all-inclusive Christ is a mystery of the mysterious God and such a Christ as the mystery of God produces a unit which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we can realize that the church is the continuation of the mystery which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mystery surely produces mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever you are, you bring forth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ, who is the mystery of God, brings forth the church, the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To see and to understand such a mystery our human mentality is altogether inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why the apostle Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 that we may understand the church which is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Pure Product out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is nothing more than a pure product out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is typified by Eve in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eve was fully, completely, and purely produced out of Adam Gen 2:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within Eve there was nothing else but Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Besides the Adamic element, there was no other element in Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever was in Eve and whatever Eve was was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eve was a full reproduction of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam and Eve are a type of Christ and the church Eph 5:30-32; Gen 2:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church must also be one element the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Other than Christ s element there should be no other element in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a vision will cause us to mourn over today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within Christianity today there is very little of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, innumerable elements other than Christ can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord s recovery, however, the church must be the pure element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anything that is other than Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christly, Resurrectionly, and Heavenly</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Christ terminated the entire old creation through His all-inclusive death, the church was produced in His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is an entity absolutely in resurrection; it is not natural, nor is it of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is a new creation created in Christ s resurrection and by the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In addition to seeing that the church was produced in Christ s resurrection, we must also see where the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church today is in Christ in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 2:6 tells us that the church has been resurrected with Christ, and now the church is seated in the heavenlies with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the church is absolutely and purely of the element of Christ, absolutely in resurrection, and absolutely remaining in the heavenlies with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The English language does not give us adequate adjective forms for the nouns Christ and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must, therefore, invent some new vocabulary words to communicate such a vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may say that today the church is Christly, resurrectionly, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three adjectives describe the fact conveyed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is of Christ; the church is of resurrection; the church is of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is Christly, resurrectionly, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the church there is no element other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a vision will govern you to the uttermost and will rule out everything that is not Christly of Christ , resurrectionly of resurrection , or heavenly of the heavens .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With the believers there is still the flesh of sin, but with the church there is no flesh of sin because the church was born in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is a matter in Christ, in resurrection, and in Christ s ascension in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Outward Aspect of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church, outwardly speaking, is a congregation called out of the world unto God for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Greek word for the church is ekklesia which means a called-out congregation, a meeting, a gathering, or an assembly, called out for a purpose Matt 16:18; 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is much better to translate this word ekklesia into assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Brethren teachers insisted on translating ekklesia in this way, so they were known as the Brethren assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is God s ekklesia, which is composed of all the believers as a congregation called out of the world by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we must gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must assemble and meet in order to have a congregation, a composition, for God to work and to move among us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the outward aspect of the church.</S>
