<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHURCH IS<br>THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22-23; 5:25-27; 2:15-16, 21-22; 4:11-12; 3:21; 1 Cor. 12:12; Rev. 1:11; Eph. 3:10-11</H1><P>The first main figure revealed in the Bible is God. Christ is the second main figure. In this chapter we come to the last two main figures in the Bible&#151;the church and the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE TO HAVE THE CHURCH</H2><P>According to the divine revelation of the Bible, the church is a matter of God's eternal purpose. God is a God of purpose. He is not a God of nonsense. He is not a meaningless God. Consider yourself. You were made in the image of God, and you are a person with purpose. We are men of purpose because we were made according to God, who is a God of purpose.</P><P>God's main purpose is to have a church. God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of other items, and then He created man. God created all things for man, and then God created man for the church. Thus, the church is the center of the universe. In the first chapter I said that man is the center of the universe. That is right. However, man, the corporate man, as the center of the universe is for the church because eventually the church comes into being out of man. Hence, the church is the ultimate center of the universe. This is according to God's eternal purpose which He made in Christ (Eph. 3:10-11). The church is of God's purpose, and God's purpose is for the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST DYING FOR THE CHURCH</H2><P>In Christianity we all have heard innumerable times that Christ loved us and died on the cross for us. But most of us have not heard a message telling us that Christ loved the church and died for the church. Ephesians 5:25 says, "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her." Christ loved the church, not just the individuals but a corporate Body, and He gave Himself up for the church. The death of Christ was for the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S ATTAINMENTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS<br>BEING FOR THE CHURCH</H2><P>Ephesians 1 says that Christ was raised from the dead and seated in the heavenlies (v. 20). He had all things subjected under His feet and was given to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22). The resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, the enthronement of Christ, and the glorification of Christ, all are for the church. All the main items of Christ's attainments and accomplishments&#151;His death, resurrection, ascension, enthronement, and glorification&#151;are for the church.</P>
