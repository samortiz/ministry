<H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING DIFFERENT KINDS<br>OF FORGIVENESS</H1><P>How many kinds of forgiveness from God are there according to the Bible? How do we explain these different kinds of forgiveness?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>We have to remember one thing: the consequences of sin determine the kind of forgiveness involved. There are at least five consequences of sin:</P><P>(1) Eternal perdition.</P><P>(2) Separation from the people of God. In the Old Testament, if an Israelite committed sin, he was cut off from the people of Israel. In the New Testament we also have these words: "Remove the evil man from among yourselves" (1 Cor. 5:13).</P><P>(3) Fellowship with God is hindered.</P><P>(4) If sin is not put away, God will chasten and discipline.</P><P>(5) If sin is not forsaken, the Lord may deal with it when He comes to reign in the millennium, and the position of this person in the kingdom may be affected by such sin.</P><P>The fourth consequence is chastisement in this age; whereas the fifth consequence is chastisement in the coming age. The Bible makes statements like, "Will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come" (Matt. 12:32). "Age" in this verse refers not to the world but to the ages. This gives us an indication that while certain sins are forgiven in this age, other sins will be forgiven in the coming age.</P><P>Since sins have five possible consequences, there must also be five kinds of forgiveness. If there were only three kinds of forgiveness, what would happen to the other two consequences of sin? If there were only four kinds of forgiveness, what would happen to the other remaining consequence of sin? Many wrongly teach that there is only one kind of judgment. The result of such a teaching is much confusion. If we are not clear regarding these five kinds of forgiveness, we will not know what to do many times.</P><P>What are the five kinds of forgiveness? First, we will mention them briefly; afterwards, we will talk about them one by one.</P><P>(1) God's eternal forgiveness. (Relating to the problem of eternal salvation.)</P><P>(2) The forgiveness through God's people. (Relating to the problem of the fellowship between God's children. This kind of forgiveness can be regarded as God's forgiveness through a person or through the forgiveness of the church.)</P><P>(3) The forgiveness to restore fellowship. (Relating to the problem of fellowshipping with God.)</P><P>(4) The forgiveness of God's discipline. (Relating to the way God disciplines His children.)</P><P>(5) The forgiveness in the kingdom. (Relating to the forgiveness of the millennium.)</P><P>Now we will explain these five kinds of forgiveness separately.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. God's Eternal Forgiveness</H2><P>Eternal forgiveness is related to man's eternal salvation. Even though this forgiveness is eternal, it is nevertheless given to the sinners in this age. What is the basis for this forgiveness? Hebrews 9:22 says, "And without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." Matthew 26:28 says, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." This verse tells us that eternal forgiveness is based on the blood of the Lord Jesus. No matter how big and gross a sin is, it can be forgiven by the blood of the Lord Jesus. But this forgiveness is not without a price, and God cannot forgive freely because "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." God's forgiveness of our sins does not mean that God is lenient toward them or will let them go. God still condemns sin as sin. God is only able to forgive us because our sins were judged in Christ. The Lord Jesus has died, shedding His precious blood and paying the price. God's way of forgiveness is most righteous. We have a Savior who has already died for us. Therefore, God has no choice but to forgive us.</P><P>The reason that our sins can be forgiven is because the Lamb of God has taken away our sins, and the blood of His Son Jesus has cleansed us of all our sins. Our forgiveness is based on the blood of the Lord Jesus, and we obtain this forgiveness through faith (Acts 10:43; 13:39). Do not think that we were forgiven because we repented for our past sins and resolved not to commit any sins in the future. The Word of God says that our sins are forgiven because of the blood of the Lord Jesus. If we believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus, we will see that our sins have been laid upon Him and that we are forgiven.</P><P>Is the forgiveness of our sins something for the present or the future? Let us read 1 John 2:12: "I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name." Pay attention to the three words "have been forgiven." They are not "will be forgiven," but "have been forgiven"; not "expected to be forgiven" or "waiting to be forgiven," but "have been forgiven." Hallelujah! As soon as we believe in the Lord Jesus, our sins are already forgiven. The Word of God says, "Little children...your sins have been forgiven you because of His name." When God says we are forgiven, we are forgiven. God does not lie.</P>
