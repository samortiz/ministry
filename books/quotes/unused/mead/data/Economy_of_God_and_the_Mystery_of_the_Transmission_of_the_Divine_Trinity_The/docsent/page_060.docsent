   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Defects and Influence of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christianity has two big defects: first, a negligence with regard to life, and second, a shortage of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christianity in its entirety is a religion with only a limited amount of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are known as the fundamentalists have four characteristics: first, they have deep faith in the Bible, believing the literal meaning of the words; second, they believe in the existence of God; third, they believe in the divinity of the Lord Jesus; and fourth, they believe that the death of the Lord Jesus was not merely the death of a martyr but was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who lacks any of these four points cannot be considered a fundamentalist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The four major fundamentalist denominations are the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, and the Episcopalians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Episcopalian Church, which is the state church of England, is also called the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its rituals and organization closely resemble those of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Mistake of the Catholic Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With regard to the fundamental faith, even the Catholic Church may be considered fundamental because she also believes in the Bible as the word of God, in the existence of God, in the divinity of the Lord Jesus, and in the redemption accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, she has mixed a large amount of leaven into the three measures of meal, as mentioned in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter the meal signifies the fundamental truths.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Three measures is the amount required for a full meal Gen 18:6 , signifying that the Catholic Church does not deny any of the fundamental truths but rather acknowledges them all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To this day she is still like this and boasts in this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nonetheless, she does not know how much leaven, heresies, she has mixed into the three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The leavening has been so thorough that even the Lord Jesus said that "the whole was leavened" Matt 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She has mixed leaven into all the fundamental truths.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have met many Germans whose specialty is chemistry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They all say that once the meal is leavened, there is no way to remove the leaven from it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Brief History of Fundamentalism</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Like the Catholic Church, the half-Catholic Episcopalian Church acknowledges the authority of the Bible, the existence of God, the divinity of Christ as the Son of God, and the death of the Lord Jesus for our redemption by the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, for the most part the Episcopalians do not see the truths in the Scriptures related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among them, some theologians might have studied this matter a little, but as a whole they do not pay much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John Nelson Darby, whom we have always respected, was originally a priest in the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After seeing much light at the age of twenty-five, he became one of the founders of the recovery that took place among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The inception of the Presbyterian churches and the Baptist churches was related to the Reformation led by Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the Reformation, Luther was constantly being threatened by the Catholic Church, and his life was always in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, he was weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time the Catholic Church's power was extremely great, and the pope's political authority was greater than that of any of the monarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, some Germanic princes were disgusted with this, so they joined together to fight against the Catholic Church in order to protect Luther, their fellow countryman.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of their protection, Luther compromised and went along with their action.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end, the Lutheran denomination, formed by the followers of Luther, became the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, one after another, the countries in Northern Europe followed suit, resulting in the formation of state churches in countries such as Denmark and Sweden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Until today many German citizens pay a church tax, and the government participates in the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, at his birth every Englishman becomes not only a subject of Great Britain but also a member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, due to the mixture of politics and religion, the situation of the state churches is very confusing and has a strong political flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the establishment of the state churches, Luther still did not leave the practice of the Catholic Church in the matter of baptism by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Soon afterward, however, some of the Lord's lovers who emerged from northern Europe studied the Scriptures and saw the truth of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually the Baptist Church was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since its formation, it has evolved into many different denominations today in Europe and America.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The strongest group was originally called the "Anabaptists," out of which came the British Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John Bunyan, the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, was an important figure in the British Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later the so-called Baptist Church reached America and was divided into the Northern Baptist Church and the Southern Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the Southern Baptist denomination has thirteen million believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Baptists in Taiwan are also generally affiliated with the Southern Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the 1700s, John Wesley, his younger brother Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield were among a small group of young men who were outstanding students at Oxford University.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They loved the Lord very much, read the Bible diligently, and determined to behave very properly and to strictly adhere to rules of love, honesty, and faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Based upon these rules they formed a society, which later developed into the Methodist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This denomination puts a strong emphasis on methods of behavior and pays much attention to conduct and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today these four major denominations, the Episcopalians, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists, along with some other smaller denominations and free groups, are the main constituents of fundamental Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these groups believe in the basic items of fundamentalism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, many of the people in these groups do not have an accurate understanding of the divinity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of saying boldly and directly that the Lord Jesus is God, they say that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To them there is still a distinction between "the Son of God" and "God."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, this involves the truth of the Divine Trinity.</S>
