   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to being the door and the pasture, Christ is our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold John 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then He goes before the sheep, and they follow Him v. 4 . As the Shepherd, Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says of Himself, "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the good Shepherd, Christ laid down His psuche life, His human life, for the sheep so that they may have the zoe life, the divine life, the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life, not in the way of outward activity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inwardly we have Christ as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because Christ shepherds us by being life to us from within, the more we live by Him as our life, the more we enjoy His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we live in the Lord in this way, we are under His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we are under Christ's shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that we are under the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real Shepherd is the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As our Shepherd, the Lord not only gives us life; He is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The living of Christ within us is actually His living shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the believers' Shepherd, Christ forms them into one flock John 10:16 , the one, universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord supplies His sheep with Himself as life so that there may be one flock and one Shepherd, one Body and one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This one flock is very different in nature from a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A fold is a religious organization; the one flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As our Shepherd, Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock, where we are in the pasture enjoying Him as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>17.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Vine</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 15 we see the focus of what God is doing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His economy God is growing Christ, and all of us are branches in Christ as the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, to us as believers, Christ is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No plant other than the vine tree can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As believers, we are branches of the vine and are good for nothing except to express the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All that the vine is and has is expressed through the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Individually, the branches are the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Corporately, they are the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, He branched out into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This branching out has made us branches of Christ as the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The vine is everything to the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever is in the vine is also in the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that as the vine Christ is a great enjoyment for us, the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the vine and through the vine we receive everything we need: life, nourishment, light, water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we need to abide in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason the Lord Jesus said concerning Himself as the vine and us as the branches, "Abide in Me and I in you" John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our life and our enjoyment are to abide in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus says, "Apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The relationship between the branches and the vine portrays the relationship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we are, what we have, and what we do must be in the Lord and by the Lord in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, it is crucial for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, we shall be finished and be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not do anything in ourselves; rather, we should do everything by abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ as the vine is our portion, an all-inclusive portion, for our daily enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then in our experience Christ will be everything to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Abiding Place</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To the believers Christ is also the abiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In John 15:4 He tells us to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Greek word translated "abide" means not only to remain in a certain place but also to dwell there, even to make our home there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is our abiding place, our dwelling place, our home, and we need to be fully settled in Him.</S>
