   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SETTING JESUS AS THE PROPITIATION COVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 3:25-26: "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This portion of the Scripture is not easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there are two points which we need to notice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God set forth Christ as a propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the original language the words "propitiation place" mean propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, the ark of the covenant was covered by a golden lid called the propitiation cover translated by the King James Version as "mercy seat" .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's prayer passed through this cover to reach God, and God's answer went through the same to meet man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was a meeting place between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now Jesus has become this propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the focal point of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both can now meet in Him on the basis of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has shed His blood and forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now He has become our propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before Jesus died, "God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From Adam to Jesus, for more than four thousand years, countless sins were committed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although God passed over them, He did not let them go by.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows His righteousness in former times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the present time, He has sent His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are now justified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In itself this very justification is a just act.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This passage tells us the different ways that God handled these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, He passed over the sins committed formerly, reckoning that Jesus would come; in this He proved Himself righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, He forgives all the sins committed now, basing this upon the judgment of Christ; in this He also declares Himself righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the death of Jesus, God has both declared us sinless as well as Himself righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HOW CAN GOD BE UNRIGHTEOUS?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once I met a sister in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She said that she was an evil person and had committed many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She had indulged in all a woman could ever commit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of this, she thought that she could never be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I checked to see whether she believed that Jesus shed His blood for the sins of man, that is, for man's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She said that she knew all these doctrines, but having been a Christian for so many years, and committing the multitude of sins as she did, it was impossible to be forgiven anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was sitting in front of her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that point I stood up and solemnly looked into her eyes, saying emphatically, "I do not care whether your sins are forgiven or not!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the way you talk implies that God has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This I do care!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, you believe that you are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet, on the other hand, you do not believe that your sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God does not forgive you, does that mean that God is unrighteous?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If He is unrighteous, then He sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can God ever sin?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not care if you are condemned and are going to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God loved you and sent His Son to pay all the debts of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His Son's death is now your death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All your sins are on His shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If what you say is true, then God has indeed taken back His words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is coming again to collect the debts of your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are saying that God cannot forgive your sins and that He has become an unrighteous God!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What kind of talk is this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this I have to stand up!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My God can never be unrighteous!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On that day, tears streamed from her eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She exclaimed, "I am sinful, but God is righteous!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has to forgive me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although my sins are numerous, thank Him; He is bound to forgive me!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He would be unrighteous if He did not do so."</S>
